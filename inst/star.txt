Full text: From masking to vaccinations, Ontario is lifting all COVID-19 restrictions by April 27 as part of its plan to live with the virus that has claimed more than 12,600 lives across the province in the last two years.
That starts with an end to mandatory masking in schools and most indoor public places March 21, as first reported by the Star.
Amid concerns that mandatory masking is being dropped too soon — especially in schools — businesses and institutions are welcome keep masking and mandatory vaccination policies as COVID-19 infection levels decline but the virus continues to circulate, provincial officials said in outlining the plan Wednesday.
And Ontarians, particularly those with underlying medical conditions that could lead to serious health problems from the virus, are encouraged to continue wearing masks in crowded situations.
“You can’t mandate masking forever. It has to be, at some point, an individual choice,” chief medical officer Dr. Kieran Moore told a news conference, noting the number of new COVID-19 cases is expected to increase “slightly” with the easing of restrictions.
Moore said he would continue to wear a mask in crowded shopping malls, for example, and added mandatory masking could return if a dangerous new variant appears.
The next step in the reopening comes Monday, when hospitals and other institutions will no longer be required to have policies requiring vaccination and testing of staff, although many hospitals have already made COVID-19 shots a condition of employment.
While masking rules will be lifted in most indoor settings on the Monday after the March school break, masks will be required in higher-risk settings until April 27 — a week before the June 2 election campaign officially begins.
That includes on public transit and in nursing and retirement homes, hospitals, shelters, jails and other congregate living settings such as facilities for Ontarians with developmental disabilities.
The Ontario Hospital Association warned that masking should be expected in hospitals “for some time as a patient-safety measure.” Lifting mandatory vaccination rules in long-term care is “irresponsible,” added AdvantAge Ontario, representing 200 not-for-profit nursing homes.
Some health experts and opposition parties pushed back at the plan to lift mandatory masking on March 21.
“Since we know that most cases of COVID-19 identified in schools originate outside of school, we would have preferred to see masks kept in place for two weeks after,” said a coalition that includes Sick Kids Hospital, the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario and children’s hospitals in London and Hamilton.
“Masks remain an important layer of protection as the pandemic continues and may be needed in communities with low vaccination rates and where there is a surge in cases. Masks also protect those most vulnerable, including high-risk, immunocompromised and fragile children.”
Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca agreed, saying that “now is not the time” to end masking in schools, while infectious diseases specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch said “I think it is reasonable to keep masks on for now and re-evaluate weekly.”
Epidemiologist Todd Coleman of Wilfrid Laurier University told the Star “it absolutely does not make sense” to lift masking as families get back to work and school following March break, and it will take two weeks after that to see if cases spike again.
Moore countered that vaccination levels in the general population are high and the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 in children is “minimal.”
“I hope parents choose to mask if their children are vulnerable to this virus,” he said.
The government will continue to provide schools with masks for staff and students who want to wear them. The Ministry of Education sent school boards a remainder that under current federal travel requirements , Canadians who return from international destinations must wear a mask at all times when in public spaces (including schools and daycares), maintain a list of all close contacts for their first 14 days and monitor for signs and symptoms of COVID-19.
In Brantford, Premier Doug Ford maintained the decision to further ease restrictions was left to Moore, and said there was no political interference with the June 2 election campaign looming.
“Let me be very clear, there’s no pressure on Dr. Moore. I follow the advice and the recommendations of the chief medical officer of Ontario,” said Ford, praising Moore for “an incredible job” that has seen Ontario fare better than most of North America during the pandemic.
“We’ve been supercautious,” the premier said, noting all 50 U.S. states have already lifted their mandatory indoor mask rules.
“If you want to keep your mask on, keep it on. If you want to take it off, take it off,” he said.
Isolation policies are also changing.
Close contacts of people testing positive for COVID-19 outside their own households will no longer be required to isolate. However, they are being advised to self-monitor for symptoms for 10 days after exposure, wear a mask and avoid activities where they would have to remove their masks, not visit anyone at high risk, such as seniors, and not visit or work in high-risk settings unless they have previously tested positive in the last 90 days.
For close contacts in a household, isolation will continue unless they have tested positive in the last 90 days, are over 18 and have received a booster shot or are under 18 and fully vaccinated.
PCR tests for COVID-19 will be available to home-care and community-care workers, provincial demonstration schools and hospital schools. Officials said the province will not open PCR testing to the general public because of wider availability of rapid tests.
Officials said there will be a “final extension” of Ontario’s emergency powers to the end of April in case they are needed, noting it is impossible to predict when a dangerous new COVID-19 variant might surface.

Full text: Brampton mayor Patrick Brown has travelled a rocky road to arrive at his position today, after a 2018 CTV news report alleging sexual misconduct threatened his political aspirations.
The following days and years found Brown and CTV embroiled in a legal battle as the former Progressive Conservative leader struggled to stay in politics. Brown and CTV have resolved the legal dispute , expressing regrets Wednesday and calling its initial story “factually incorrect.”
Here’s a timeline of major events.
Nov. 2000: A 22-year-old Brown is elected to Barrie City Council—the Toronto native’s first foray into electoral politics. He would be re-elected in 2003 and serve for roughly five years.
Jan. 2006: Brown is first elected to the House of Commons as a Conservative for the riding of Barrie, beating out Liberal incumbent Aileen Carroll. He’d be re-elected in 2008 and 2011.
May 9, 2015: Brown wins leadership of Ontario’s Progressive Conservative party, replacing Tim Hudak and beating then-rival Christine Elliott for the position.
Jan. 24, 2018: Brown denies allegations of sexual misconduct from two women, published by CTV news. Some of the alleged incidents date back to when Brown was a councillor for Barrie.

Feb. 26, 2018: Brown drops out of Conservative leadership race , saying he couldn’t campaign while also fighting CTV’s allegations. Hours earlier, the Star learned his nomination was being probed by police .
April 23, 2018: Brown sues CTV News for $8 million over its story; if successful, it would be the biggest libel award in Canadian history.
May. 17, 2018: Brown says he’s writing a tell-all book about his “political assassination.”
July 3, 2018: Brown attempts a political comeback , announces he’s running for the first elected regional chair of Peel. The role was scuppered by the province before an election was held.

Full text: CTV News has expressed "regrets" over a 2018 story about then Progressive Conservative leader Patrick Brown with "factually incorrect" information that caused "harm" to his provincial political career.
In a settlement Wednesday, CTV acknowledged the story, which alleged sexual impropriety with two women, "required correction." After the story was broadcast, Brown strongly denied the allegations and filed an $8-million defamation suit against the network's parent company, Bell Media.
"Patrick Brown and CTV have resolved their legal dispute," according to a statement agreed upon by the two parties.
"On Jan. 24, 2018, four months before a provincial election, CTV broadcast a segment concerning Patrick Brown. Key details provided to CTV for the story were factually incorrect and required correction," it continues.
"CTV National News regrets including those details in the story and any harm this may have caused to Mr. Brown."
Both Brown and CTV said they would have no further comment on the settlement or any other terms.
The resolution ends four years of headline-making litigation and clears the way for Brown, who is now the mayor of Brampton, to seek the federal Conservative leadership.
On Tuesday, Brown confirmed to John Moore on Newstalk 1010 that he's exploring a bid to lead the federal party.
Brown was a Tory MP before jumping to provincial politics in 2015. He is regarded as one of the party's top organizers with a vast network of contacts across Canada, especially among cultural communities.
Sources told the Star he could enter the contest as early as this week.
So far, there are only two official candidates, MP Pierre Poilievre (Carleton) and MP Leslyn Lewis (Haldimand-Norfolk), who ran in 2020. Former Quebec premier and one-time federal Progressive Conservative leader Jean Charest is expected to announce his bid Thursday.
In January 2018, Brown stepped down as PC leader hours after CTV broadcast the story.
That capped a dramatic night of regicide at Queen's Park, as Brown was under pressure from caucus members who were concerned about their own prospects in the looming June 2018 campaign.
His successor as Ontario PC leader was Doug Ford, a one-term Toronto city councillor with no political experience at the provincial level. Ford was elected premier in a majority government, and is now seeking re-election on June 2.
While the CTV story cut short Brown's 2015-18 tenure as Tory leader, it did not end his political career.
In October 2018, he was elected mayor of Brampton, unseating incumbent Linda Jeffrey in an upset victory.
Brown's legal action argued the network "falsely, maliciously, unfairly and irresponsibly broadcast" a story that cost him his job as leader of the Opposition while Liberal Kathleen Wynne was premier.
In an emotional, 81-second news conference at Queen's Park on Jan. 24, 2018 - held just 15 minutes before the CTV story was broadcast - the distraught leader denied any wrongdoing.
But nearly all of his staff and campaign aides resigned that night, and he quit as party leader.
His lawyers argued Brown was "ambushed ... mere hours before" the newscast and "had no reasonable time to respond."
At the time, CTV reported that one of the women who alleged misconduct against Brown said she was in high school when she met him at a bar.
But the woman later revised her recollection, telling the network that she was 19 years old, not 18, at the time of the alleged encounter.
The entire episode is recounted in his autobiography, "Takedown: The Attempted Political Assassination of Patrick Brown."
That controversial book was critical of the media and some provincial Conservatives, including current cabinet ministers Vic Fedeli and Lisa MacLeod, as well as Brown's chief of staff, campaign manager, advertising expert and press secretary, all of whom resigned.
It also detailed the personal toll on his family.
Brown is now a married father of two young children. In an interview with the Star to mark the first anniversary of his defenestration, he was philosophical.
"When I look back at 2018, it's with fondness," he said in 2019, pointing to his marriage to Genevieve Gualtieri.
"In hockey, you get bodychecked, you get knocked down, you get back up," he said. "I got hit pretty hard - I got levelled like a truck with those allegations - but in adversity it's an opportunity to show what you're made of too."
The federal Conservative contest has been heating up in recent days.
Candidates must pay a $200,000 entry fee as well as a $100,000 refundable deposit. The deadline for entry is April 19 and membership sales are open until June 3 with the new leader elected by Sept. 10.
MP Scott Aitchison (Parry Sound-Muskoka), MPP Roman Baber (York Centre) and former MP Leona Alleslev are also considering runs.

Full text: OTTAWA—A former prime minister ready to weigh in. Scorned social conservatives. A summer cottage meet-cute. A decades old campus grudge match.
While the federal Conservative leadership race sets the course for the party’s future, some story lines from the past are shaping the race.
Former party leader and Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper, for instance, has been sending signals he’s not willing to take a back seat if former Progressive Conservative leader Jean Charest runs.
The two interacted often when Harper was prime minister and Charest was premier of Quebec, where he harshly criticized Harper often and in particular, during the 2008 election in which the federal Conservatives again failed to secure a majority.
How exactly Harper will engage in this leadership contest is unclear, two sources close to him told the Star, but what is certain, they said, is that he will be motivated by a desire to ensure a “true Conservative” wins.
In 2020, Erin O’Toole won the last leadership contest on a pledge that he would be that “true blue” Tory, but his approach in the months after led to the accusation he betrayed party principles and ultimately MPs voted him out.
His tenure left a mark on the party.
That he flipped and supported carbon pricing is one factor cited by insiders, who say the party will be more skeptical this time around about policy promises made to the grassroots.
Another allegedly broken promise: O’Toole was able to hoover up support from rival leadership candidate Leslyn Lewis’s socially conservative backers in the 2020 contest by suggesting she’d have a strong voice in Parliament. But she found herself on the outside under his leadership, with very little speaking time.
Campaign Life Coalition, a social conservative group that tends to play an active role in leadership races, has warned the party not to make the same mistake again and be fooled by candidates with progressive views.
“Social liberalism is the best predictor for future betrayal on small-c conservative principles,” the coalition wrote in a recent email, saying it cannot endorse the campaign’s only declared candidate — Pierre Poilievre, who is popular among party libertarians but promotes progressive social views.
Poilievre has several Harper allies at his side. Jenni Byrne, who ran Harper’s successful 2011 campaign, has joined his team. Former Conservative cabinet minister John Baird and Conservative Sen. Leo Housakos, appointed by Harper, are among the chairs of his campaign.
Another former conservative prime minister could also wield significant influence in the race.
The night O’Toole won the leadership, he promised voters he was building a new Conservative party — “not your dad’s Conservative party,” as he would later say.
Minutes after he uttered that line during the 2021 election campaign, former Progressive Conservative prime minister Brian Mulroney endorsed him.
The two spoke often in the months that O’Toole was at the helm, and during his final days as leader.
During the last leadership race, however, Mulroney was quietly helping O’Toole rival Peter MacKay, who was the last leader of the federal Progressive Conservative party before it merged with the Canadian Alliance in 2003.
Before Charest became PC leader, he was environment minister in the Mulroney government, a record voters can expect to hear about in this campaign.
But some close to Charest don’t expect — or necessarily want — Mulroney to take an active role in this campaign, saying former leaders shouldn’t meddle.
Still, Mulroney and the successes he had as a PC prime minister hover over Charest’s bid. At a recent reception for MPs in downtown Ottawa, a handful of attendees said they support Charest because of the positive impression he made decades ago in the federal cabinet.
Meanwhile, history could shape the race in another way if Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown enters, as he is widely expected to do, resurrecting a campus rivalry with Poilievre.
In 1998, as Charest was on his way out as PC leader, Brown had become the president of the party’s youth wing for a two-year term.
The two had a personal connection: one summer, Brown had been visiting family in Quebec and discovered their next door neighbour was Charest.
“His mum goes looking for him and he’s over at Jean Charest’s house and Jean Charest’s wife has got tea out, and cakes and pies. He was a bit star-struck,” a cousin told the Star back in 2015.
A year after Brown took over the youth wing, Poilievre was the president of the University of Calgary campus club, where he expressed frustration with the party’s direction under Joe Clark, according to coverage from the Calgary Herald.
Brown had mused about kicking out the anti-Clark factions from the party’s youth wing; Poilievre objected, threatening to take his club executive over to the United Alternative movement.
Poilievre would go on to come of political age on the right wing of the modern-day Conservative party Among the donors to his first run for office in 2004? Mulroney.
While the tangled web of the party’s past is no doubt in play, some grassroots members say the focus for this race really has to be on the future.
Justin Burton, who has for years run a blog devoted to rising stars in the conservative movement, framed it in stark terms.
“This election is about the soul of our party and the ideology that we want to build a record on,” he said.
“I am confident that this leader is out there. Now we need to find them.”

Ford government offers Ontario nurses a $5K 'retention' bonus

Full text: Ontario nurses are being offered a $5,000 “retention” bonus by Premier Doug Ford’s government — half before the June 2 election and half afterwards — in a move health care unions call a “pay-as-you-vote gimmick.”
Health Minister Christine Elliott said the money is intended as a reward for nurses who “stayed on the front lines” during the COVID-19 pandemic and to encourage them to stay in the profession amid a shortage of staff.
“This payment will help retain nurses across the health sector and stabilize the current nursing workforce during this critical time,” Elliott added in a statement.
But unions representing nurses and other health-care workers warn the payouts risk “further demoralizing the workforce by providing one-time payments to some, but not all” and again urged Ford to end wage caps under his Bill 124 austerity legislation.
“Absent a real plan to confront Ontario’s chronic staffing shortage, nurses, personal support workers and other dedicated health professionals see these short-term promises for what they are: pay-as-you-vote gimmicks,” the Ontario Nurses’ Association, SEIU Healthcare, Canadian Union of Public Employees and Unifor said in a joint letter to Ford.
“While retaining nurses is vitally important, there are shortages in many health-care occupations and professions, and it is appropriate to extend any retention bonuses to all.”
Elliott, who on Friday confirmed she won’t seek re-election in June , to made the announcement in Belleville, away from the media spotlight at Queen’s Park.
Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca said Ford has ignored nurses’ concerns about the wage cap and hectic, dangerous working conditions during COVID-19 but now expects a “free pass by handing out a one-time cheque right before an election.”
Del Duca pledged to scrap Bill 124 if elected premier.
Ontario Nurses’ Association president Cathryn Hoy sent a memo to her union’s 68,000 members saying the money “doesn’t begin to address the issues driving nurses away and hurting patient care.”
“I know that nurses across the province are irate at once again being thrown crumbs,” she added.
Under the Progressive Conservative government’s offer, $763 million has been earmarked to provide the lump-sum payments to eligible full-time nurses, with amounts pro-rated for those working part-time or casually.
Nurses must be employed as of March 31 to get the first payment and on Sept. 1 for the second. Payments will be made by employers.
The money will go to nurses in hospitals, nursing homes, retirement homes, home and community care, primary care, mental health and addictions, emergency services, the corrections and youth justice systems, and other community-based and developmental services. Nurses in management roles deployed to direct patient care also qualify.
Wage increases for many public sector workers, including nurses, have been capped at one per cent annually under Bill 124.
“What health-care workers want is to be able to bargain wages that reflect their contribution and the significant inflation they are facing,” said Michael Hurley of the Ontario Council of Hospital Unions and the Canadian Union of Public Employees.
“Almost every health-care worker in the province continues to work under emergency orders that supersede their rights under their collective agreement,” said Katha Fortier of Unifor, which also represents journalists at the Toronto Star.
“They can be subjected to schedule changes, cancelled vacation and reassignment at a moment’s notice.”
The government has previously given personal support workers in nursing homes, for example, a $3 hourly bonus to stay in their jobs amid high turnover and illness rates during COVID-19.

Full text: OTTAWA—The field of potential contenders for leadership of the federal Conservatives shrank Monday, with longtime conservative commentator Tasha Kheiriddin saying she’s decided not to run.
Instead, she’ll back former Progressive Conservative leader Jean Charest, saying the pair share the same values.
Kheiriddin’s name surfaced as a potential contender shortly after Erin O’Toole was kicked out of the job last month.
From Quebec, the fluently bilingual former lawyer has long-standing connections to the progressive wing of the party, and she was cited by many insiders as the fresh face needed to engage new voters.
She had taken a leave from her job at the strategy firm Navigator to consider a bid, telling the Star as recently as Friday she was still thinking it over.
On Monday, she said after surveying the landscape, she realized she and Charest wanted and believed in the same things.
“We would just be battling each other and there is no point doing that,” she told the Star.
“We should be united.”
Kheiriddin said she will be playing a role in Charest’s campaign.
Charest has yet to formally commit to running, though he met with MPs in Ottawa last week to suss out caucus support and is expected to formally launch his campaign in the coming days.
The only formally declared candidate is MP Pierre Poilievre.
Prospective candidates have until April 19 to apply to run, and must pay a $200,000 entry fee plus a $100,000 deposit, as well as garner signatures in support of their bid.
Conservative party members will choose their new leader via mail-in ballot with the winner to be announced on Sept. 10.

Ontario offering nurses up to $5,000 as job retention incentive

Full text: Ontario is offering all nurses incentive pay of up to $5,000 per person to encourage job retention.
Health Minister Christine Elliott said Monday the payments are meant to support nurses as the province recovers from the pandemic.
"A strong nursing workforce is going to be critical to supporting the provinces recovery in the months and years ahead. Simply put, an investment in our nurses is an investment in our future," she said at a news conference in Belleville, Ont.
"As we continue our efforts to build up our nursing workforce, this investment will help us to retain the nurses that we already have."
The government has priced the plan at $763 million. Payments will come from employers in two instalments, in a lump sum for full-time nurses and as a prorated payment for part-time and casual nursing staff.
Nurses in hospitals, long-term care, retirement homes, home care, mental health and addictions, emergency services and corrections and others who worked directly with patients during the pandemic will be eligible.
Nurses must be employed as of March 31 to receive the first payment and Sept. 1 to receive the second.
Elliott said the government is working with employers to get the first payment out "within the next few months."
A spokeswoman for Elliott said full-time nurses employed in eligible sectors by Sept. 1 who worked between Feb. 13 and April 22 of this year will receive $5,000 in total.
Alexandra Hilkene said the incentive amount for part-time and casual nurses will be determined based on all hours worked during the Feb. 13 and April 22 period to a maximum of 375 hours, "to most effectively and equitably provide the incentive" to those workers.
Nurse retention has been raised as a key issue through Ontario's battle with the COVID-19 pandemic
Unions have raised concerns about burnout and low wages after two years of the pandemic, factors they argue are driving people to leave the professional altogether.
A group of healthcare unions on Monday called the retention payment a "temporary fix" that they said won't help retain nurses who want long-term support.
SEIU Healthcare, Unifor, the Ontario Council of Hospital Unions and the Ontario Nurses' Association issued a joint statement that was also critical of the fact that other health-care workers were excluded from the retention bonus.
"We are once again cautioning you against further demoralizing the workforce by providing one-time payments to some, but not all, health care workers," the union presidents said in an open letter to Premier Doug Ford.
"While you're promising up to five-thousand dollars for nurses, what they really want is the support to do their jobs well and to do them safely."
The group called again on Ford to repeal Bill 124, which caps annual public sector wage increases at one per cent, and asked the government to "move past the band aid pay-as-you-vote gimmicks."
The leader of the provincial Liberals accused Ford of trying to "buy" nurses' votes ahead of the provincial election expected on June 2.
"Doug Ford can't spend years attacking nurses, capping their pay, and turning his back on them when things got tough, then expect a free pass by handing out a one-time cheque right before an election," Steven Del Duca said in a written statement.
The CEO of Home Care Ontario said her association "applauds" the move to offer retention payments, but called for the government to spend more money on stabilizing the home care workforce and a tax credit for family-funded home care.
"We have much more to do to if government wants to put home care on stable footing," Sue VanderBent said in a written statement.
This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 7, 2022.

Province backs down on Chinese medicine rules: Critics worried patient safety was in jeopardy

Full text: The Ontario government is backing down from a controversial plan to deregulate acupuncture and other forms of traditional Chinese medicine that critics said would have jeopardized the safety of patients.
Health Minister Christine Elliott announced the change Monday as several dozen opponents of the move protested in front of the legislature following concerns raised since the deregulation was included in unrelated legislation on rights for gig workers last week.
While Elliott charged the existing registration system is "unfair" and has "prevented people who primarily speak Cantonese or Mandarin from practising traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture in Ontario," the regulatory college painted a different picture.
"Since 2013, not one applicant has been denied registration because of a lack of language proficiency," said Ann Zeng, registrar and chief executive of the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of Ontario.
"Of the more than 2,700 members of the college, over 100 have declared they are not fluent in English or French."
Elliott said the government is now working with the college, which was created by a previous Liberal government by 2006 legislation, to offer registration exams in Cantonese and Mandarin.
Plans to wind down the college are being scrapped.
Opposition parties used the words "reckless" and "irresponsible" to describe the deregulation plan, which Government House Leader Paul Calandra said was developed because of "a disconnect" between potential practitioners and the college.
"The No. 1 complaint we are hearing is that people were not being able to enter into the practice of traditional Chinese medicine," he added, citing concerns from Chinese Canadians in five GTA ridings, including his in Markham-Stouffville.
Critics questioned why the Progressive Conservative government felt it was necessary to scrap regulation of traditional Chinese medicine instead of finding another way to approve more practitioners. They also said it was obvious from the backlash that the government didn't consult widely enough on its plan.
"The reasons Doug Ford gave never made any sense," said Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca. "What we still don't know is who Doug Ford was actually looking to benefit."
New Democrat MPP France Gelinas, her party's health critic, said Calandra may have provided a clue by naming five GTA ridings held by Progressive Conservatives.
"We are close to an election," she noted of the June 2 provincial vote.
The scrapped changes would have repealed the 2006 Chinese Medicine Act and put practitioners under the oversight of the Health and Supportive Care Providers Authority of Ontario at a time when the regulatory college is conducting 70 investigations into its members.
Deregulation would have put an end to those probes, along with eight pending disciplinary hearings. To date, the college has issued 38 discipline decisions. Sanctions have ranged from matters including sexual assault to providing patients false hope about treatments. Licences have been suspended in some cases and remedial training ordered in others.
There were also concerns that deregulation would prompt insurance companies to stop providing coverage for some types of traditional Chinese medicine.
"Removing the college is bad for patients and bad for practitioners," said Green Leader Mike Schreiner.

Full text: A former prime minister ready to weigh in. Scorned social conservatives. A summer cottage meet-cute. A decades-old campus grudge match.
While the federal Conservative leadership race sets the course for the party's future, some story lines from the past are shaping the race.
Former party leader and Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper, for instance, has been sending signals he's not willing to take a back seat if former Progressive Conservative leader Jean Charest runs.
The two interacted often when Harper was prime minister and Charest was premier of Quebec, where he harshly criticized Harper often and in particular, during the 2008 election in which the federal Conservatives again failed to secure a majority.
How exactly Harper would engage in this leadership contest is unclear, two sources close to him told the Star, but what is certain, they said, is that he will be motivated by a desire to ensure a "true Conservative" wins.
In 2020, Erin O'Toole won the last leadership contest on a pledge that he would be that "true blue" Tory, but his approach in the months after led to the accusation he betrayed party principles and ultimately MPs voted him out.
His tenure left a mark on the party.
That he flipped and supported carbon pricing is one factor cited by insiders, who say the party will be more skeptical this time around about policy promises made to the grassroots.
Another allegedly broken promise: O'Toole was able to hoover up support from rival leadership candidate Leslyn Lewis's socially conservative backers in the 2020 contest by suggesting she'd have a strong voice in Parliament. But she found herself on the outside under his leadership, with very little speaking time.
Campaign Life Coalition, a social conservative group that tends to play an active role in leadership races, has warned the party not to make the same mistake again and be fooled by candidates with progressive views.
"Social liberalism is the best predictor for future betrayal on small-c conservative principles," the coalition wrote in a recent email, saying it cannot endorse the campaign's only declared candidate: Pierre Poilievre, who is popular among party libertarians but promotes progressive social views.
Poilievre has several Harper allies at his side. Jenni Byrne, who ran Harper's successful 2011 campaign, has joined his team. Former Conservative cabinet minister John Baird and Conservative Sen. Leo Housakos, appointed by Harper, are among the chairs of his campaign.
Another former conservative prime minister could also wield significant influence in the race.
The night O'Toole won the leadership, he promised voters he was building a new Conservative party - "not your dad's Conservative party," as he would later say.
Minutes after he uttered that line during the 2021 election campaign, former Progressive Conservative prime minister Brian Mulroney endorsed him.
The two spoke often in the months that O'Toole was at the helm, and during his final days as leader.
During the last leadership race, however, Mulroney was quietly helping O'Toole rival Peter MacKay, who was the last leader of the federal Progressive Conservative party before it merged with the Canadian Alliance in 2003.
Before Charest became PC leader, he was environment minister in the Mulroney government, a record voters can expect to hear about in this campaign.
But some close to Charest don't expect - or necessarily want - Mulroney to take an active role in this campaign, saying former leaders shouldn't meddle.
Still, Mulroney and the successes he had as a PC prime minister hover over Charest's bid.
At a recent reception for MPs in downtown Ottawa, a handful of attendees said they support Charest because of the positive impression he made decades ago in the federal cabinet.
Meanwhile, history could shape the race in another way if Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown enters, as he is widely expected to do, resurrecting a campus rivalry with Poilievre.
In 1998, as Charest was on his way out as PC leader, Brown had become the president of the party's youth wing for a two-year term.
The two had a personal connection: One summer, Brown had been visiting family in Quebec and discovered their next-door neighbour was Charest.
"His mum goes looking for him and he's over at Jean Charest's house and Jean Charest's wife has got tea out, and cakes and pies. He was a bit star-struck," a cousin told the Star back in 2015.
A year after Brown took over the youth wing, Poilievre was the president of the University of Calgary campus club, where he expressed frustration with the party's direction under Joe Clark, according to coverage from the Calgary Herald.
Brown had mused about kicking out the anti-Clark factions from the party's youth wing; Poilievre objected, threatening to take his club executive over to the United Alternative movement.
Poilievre would go on to come of political age on the right wing of the modern-day Conservative party Among the donors to his first run for office in 2004? Mulroney.
While the tangled web of the party's past is no doubt in play, some grassroots members say the focus for this race really has to be on the future.
Justin Burton, who has for years run a blog devoted to rising stars in the conservative movement, framed it in stark terms.
"This election is about the soul of our party and the ideology that we want to build a record on," he said.
"I am confident that this leader is out there. Now we need to find them."

Province backs down on Chinese medicine rules: Critics worried patient safety was in jeopardy

Full text: The Ontario government is backing down from a controversial plan to deregulate acupuncture and other forms of traditional Chinese medicine that critics said would have jeopardized the safety of patients.
Health Minister Christine Elliott announced the change Monday as several dozen opponents of the move protested in front of the legislature following concerns raised since the deregulation was included in unrelated legislation on rights for gig workers last week.
While Elliott charged the existing registration system is "unfair" and has "prevented people who primarily speak Cantonese or Mandarin from practising traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture in Ontario," the regulatory college painted a different picture.
"Since 2013, not one applicant has been denied registration because of a lack of language proficiency," said Ann Zeng, registrar and chief executive of the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of Ontario.
"Of the more than 2,700 members of the college, over 100 have declared they are not fluent in English or French."
Elliott said the government is now working with the college, which was created by a previous Liberal government by 2006 legislation, to offer registration exams in Cantonese and Mandarin.
Plans to wind down the college are being scrapped.
Opposition parties used the words "reckless" and "irresponsible" to describe the deregulation plan, which Government House Leader Paul Calandra said was developed because of "a disconnect" between potential practitioners and the college.
"The No. 1 complaint we are hearing is that people were not being able to enter into the practice of traditional Chinese medicine," he added, citing concerns from Chinese Canadians in five GTA ridings, including his in Markham-Stouffville.
Critics questioned why the Progressive Conservative government felt it was necessary to scrap regulation of traditional Chinese medicine instead of finding another way to approve more practitioners. They also said it was obvious from the backlash that the government didn't consult widely enough on its plan.
"The reasons Doug Ford gave never made any sense," said Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca. "What we still don't know is who Doug Ford was actually looking to benefit."
New Democrat MPP France Gelinas, her party's health critic, said Calandra may have provided a clue by naming five GTA ridings held by Progressive Conservatives.
"We are close to an election," she noted of the June 2 provincial vote.
The scrapped changes would have repealed the 2006 Chinese Medicine Act and put practitioners under the oversight of the Health and Supportive Care Providers Authority of Ontario at a time when the regulatory college is conducting 70 investigations into its members.
Deregulation would have put an end to those probes, along with eight pending disciplinary hearings. To date, the college has issued 38 discipline decisions. Sanctions have ranged from matters including sexual assault to providing patients false hope about treatments. Licences have been suspended in some cases and remedial training ordered in others.
There were also concerns that deregulation would prompt insurance companies to stop providing coverage for some types of traditional Chinese medicine.
"Removing the college is bad for patients and bad for practitioners," said Green Leader Mike Schreiner.

Full text: Doug Ford has doled out election treats to drivers and some transit riders. But guess who’s getting taken for a ride?, Mar. 5
Doug Ford ignored climate change, cancelled cap-and-trade and removed the incentives to buy electric vehicles. The pandemic? Too little, too late every time, leading to high infection rates, hospital overload and unnecessary deaths. Ford gave greenbelt space to his friends, the developers, accelerating climate change.
No wonder Christine Elliot is bailing!
Ford has dropped licence fees for vehicles while still bearing the cost of tracking registrations, distributing stickers and paying to refund fees.
This will cost the taxpayer dearly. A sum of $120 in a year is about 50 cents a work day, way less than the cost of a coffee.
Will Ford reverse it if he’s reelected?

Full text: Ontario nurses are being offered a $5,000 "retention" bonus by Premier Doug Ford's government - half before the June 2 election and half afterward - in a move health-care unions call a "pay-as-you-vote gimmick."
Health Minister Christine Elliott said the money is intended as a reward for nurses who "stayed on the front lines" during the COVID-19 pandemic and to encourage them to stay in the profession amid a shortage of staff.
"This payment will help retain nurses across the health sector and stabilize the current nursing workforce during this critical time," Elliott added.
But unions representing nurses and other health-care workers warn the payouts risk "further demoralizing the workforce by providing one-time payments to some, but not all" and again urged Ford to end wage caps under his Bill 124 austerity legislation.
"Absent a real plan to confront Ontario's chronic staffing shortage, nurses, personal support workers and other dedicated health professionals see these short-term promises for what they are: pay-as-you-vote gimmicks," the Ontario Nurses' Association, SEIU Healthcare, Canadian Union of Public Employees and Unifor said in a joint letter to Ford.
"While retaining nurses is vitally important, there are shortages in many health-care occupations and professions, and it is appropriate to extend any retention bonuses to all."
Elliott, who on Friday confirmed she won't seek re-election in June, to made the announcement in Belleville, away from the media spotlight at Queen's Park.
Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca said Ford has ignored nurses' concerns about the wage cap and hectic, dangerous working conditions during COVID-19 but now expects a "free pass by handing out a one-time cheque right before an election."
Del Duca pledged to scrap Bill 124 if elected premier.
Ontario Nurses' Association president Cathryn Hoy sent a memo to her union's 68,000 members saying the money "doesn't begin to address the issues driving nurses away and hurting patient care."
"I know that nurses across the province are irate at once again being thrown crumbs," she added.
Under the Progressive Conservative government's offer, $763 million has been earmarked to provide the lump-sum payments to eligible full-time nurses, with amounts pro-rated for those working part-time or casually.
Nurses must be employed as of March 31 to get the first payment and on Sept. 1 for the second. Payments will be made by employers.
The money will go to nurses in hospitals, nursing homes, retirement homes, home and community care, primary care, mental health and addictions, emergency services, the corrections and youth justice systems, and other community-based and developmental services. Nurses in management roles deployed to direct patient care also qualify.
Wage increases for many public sector workers, including nurses, have been capped at one per cent annually under Bill 124.
"What health-care workers want is to be able to bargain wages that reflect their contribution and the significant inflation they are facing," said Michael Hurley of the Ontario Council of Hospital Unions and the Canadian Union of Public Employees.
"Almost every health-care worker in the province continues to work under emergency orders that supersede their rights under their collective agreement," said Katha Fortier of Unifor, which also represents journalists at the Toronto Star.
"They can be subjected to schedule changes, cancelled vacation and reassignment at a moment's notice."
The government has previously given personal support workers in nursing homes, for example, a $3 hourly bonus to stay in their jobs amid high turnover and illness rates during COVID-19.

Full text: The Ontario government is backing down from a controversial plan to deregulate acupuncture and other forms of traditional Chinese medicine that critics said would have jeopardized the safety of patients.
Health Minister Christine Elliott announced the change Monday as several dozen opponents of the move protested in front of the legislature following concerns raised since the deregulation was included in unrelated legislation on rights for gig workers last week.
While Elliott charged the existing registration system is “unfair” and has “prevented people who primarily speak Cantonese or Mandarin from practising traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture in Ontario,” the regulatory college painted a different picture.
“Since 2013, not one applicant has been denied registration because of a lack of language proficiency,” said Ann Zeng, registrar and chief executive of the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of Ontario.
“Of the more than 2,700 members of the college, over 100 have declared they are not fluent in English or French.”
Elliott said the government is now working with the college — which was created by a previous Liberal government by 2006 legislation —to offer registration exams in Cantonese and Mandarin.
Plans to wind down the college are being scrapped.
Opposition parties used the words “reckless” and “irresponsible” to describe the deregulation plan, which Government House Leader Paul Calandra said was developed because of “a disconnect” between potential practitioners and the college.
“The number-one complaint we are hearing is that people were not being able to enter into the practice of traditional Chinese medicine,” he added, citing concerns from Chinese Canadians in his riding of Markham-Stouffville and four others in the GTA.
Critics questioned why the Progressive Conservative government felt it was necessary to scrap regulation of traditional Chinese medicine instead of finding another way to approve more practitioners. They also said it was obvious from the backlash that the government didn’t consult widely enough on its plan.
“The reasons Doug Ford gave never made any sense,” said Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca. “What we still don’t know is who Doug Ford was actually looking to benefit.”
New Democrat MPP France Gelinas, her party’s health critic, said Calandra may have provided a clue by naming five GTA ridings held by Progressive Conservatives.
“We are close to an election,” she noted of the June 2 provincial vote.
The scrapped changes would have repealed the 2006 Chinese Medicine Act and put practitioners under the oversight of the Health and Supportive Care Providers Authority of Ontario at a time when the regulatory college is conducting 70 investigations into its members.
Deregulation would have put an end to those probes, along with eight pending disciplinary hearings.
To date, the college has issued 38 discipline decisions. Sanctions have ranged from matters including sexual assault to providing patients false hope about treatments. Licences have been suspended in some cases and remedial training ordered in others.
There were also concerns that deregulation would prompt insurance companies to stop providing coverage for some types of traditional Chinese medicine.
“Removing the college is bad for patients and bad for practitioners,” said Green Leader Mike Schreiner.

Full text: On Tuesday, we celebrate International Women’s Day. Let joy be unconfined, etc.
But admit it, it’s difficult in one of the most fraught years in the planet’s history to see advancements in women’s rights. We’re in the shadows. It’s a twist on what women are told whenever they ask for a raise: “Now is not the time.”
It seems now is not the time for women to close the wage gap, for femicide to decrease, for abusive men to be exiled from the home rather than the women and children they torment, for women to prosper at work while raising children, to retain access to abortion, or even to feel easy about using the word “woman.”
No, we have been called “menstruators” and even “chest-feeders” and “pregnant people.” When so many of us never did or no longer do menstruate, breastfeed or give birth, we do not exist, I suppose.
This last one is a minor fringe issue, already fading. The others will not fade. Money rules all. Access to money is at the heart of women’s advancement, and it’s not going well.
As Armine Yalnizyan wrote in the Star in Sept. 2021, “Canada-wide, just 56.7 per cent of the population of women aged 15 and over have paid work, levels last seen in 2002.” That was 20 long years ago. Although Quebec and B.C. have recovered to 2016 levels, Ontario is in the backwoods of 1999.
I hope those numbers have gone up as we slowly reopen. Retail jobs sustained so many women. As you walk down the street, look around you. Do you see an open store and if so, is it well-staffed? Should you bother? This is not an anecdote but a national problem. It’s unclear if retailers understand their own shrinkage or the appeal of Amazon.
As our population ages, employment changes. As Yalnizyan put it in another column , do jobs deserve that old “devotion?” Unless caregivers, usually women, are paid fairly with steady, safe work and good benefits, our current crisis will widen again.
Women are seeking to enter new fields in large numbers, including medicine, surgery, trades, law, architecture, possibly policing, and the highest reaches of politics. It was a sorrow to see Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott announce her departure from politics . She was the only competent member of Premier Doug Ford’s cabinet, and he has always taken care to have no plausible successor in place.
On the other hand, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a feminist, has always advanced the cause of women. Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland has been called “Minister of Everything,” having served as minister of international trade, foreign affairs, and intergovernmental affairs — and (still) as deputy prime minister.
And she has been strikingly competent in every portfolio, thanks to her intelligence, breadth of knowledge, human understanding and patience. The quality we most need in politicians right now is unflappability, a radiating confidence that problems can indeed be solved.
I see fatigue, rage and panic among citizens. Trudeau has been a calming figure offering careful confidence. He hasn’t been afraid to hand over to Freeland to let her do her finance job but also to comment publicly on a devastated country she knows well: Ukraine.
Politicians are rarely so generous about the local competition. U.S. President Joe Biden hasn’t allowed Vice-President Kamala Harris to range widely, to allow Americans to get to know her. At his age with poor prospects for re-election, the Democrats — and the planet — may pay heavily for this.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson won’t leave, partly because he knows voters can see his cabinet is packed with no-hopers. That’s his plan. It’s not a great one for Britain. He’s rather Putin-like that way.
Things to cheer about: abortion pills are becoming more commonly used, the concept of “femicide” as a particular kind of killing is slowly being recognized, #MeToo has finished off many old beasts, and then there’s this last crucial fact: Women don’t give up. We never have. We never will.
Happy International Women’s Day, and may we see many more.

Full text: Getting around the city can be a political act.
It's election season, so getting around is even more political than usual, with commuters of all kinds being wooed with treats. Some commuters more than others, that is.
Last month the Ford government announced licence plate renewal fees are being scrapped. That's an awful lot of money out of the provincial coffers related to infrastructure that takes a lot of wear and tear from motorists and costs an awful lot to keep in a state of good repair. Remember, the rebuilding of a small section of the Gardiner Expressway alone eats up $2 billion, or 38 per cent, of the city of Toronto's 2021-2030 capital budget for transportation. Can we complain about potholes with a plate rebate in our hands?
It's bold to cut this revenue while pushing through the quite-controversial expansion of Highway 413 into the Greenbelt as well as the Bradford Bypass, massive road building that will cost billions. The Ford government offered more treats when it announced it would cancel tolls on Highways 412 and 418. How will that revenue be replaced?
If you ride the TTC or another Ontario transit agency and watched the fares go up and up over the years, you might ask, where's my treat? If tolls are removed from the highway and plates, why can't the tolls on riding the bus, streetcar, or subway be removed?
The Ford government announced last week it would be eliminating "double fares" for riders on trips that connect from GO Transit to local transit services across the Greater Golden Horseshoe, but not including the TTC. It's a very conspicuous omission from a government that has often treated Toronto conspicuously different than it treats other municipalities.
On the face of it, this is a good start in erasing some of the arbitrary borders across our region.
While everyone in the Golden Horseshoe lives in distinct places that are self-governed, when it comes to transportation, we're all one metropolis, living, working and going to school across those borders, part of the same social and economic area. Transportation should be fluid. If you're in a car, save for the welcome sign at the city limits, you barely notice when you cross from one municipality to another. On transit, though, you're much more likely to notice because another fare is required.
Many transit systems around the world have zoned fares. The London Underground is one such system, with six zones that radiate from the city centre in concentric rings. Travelling within the dense first or second zone is a base fare. The more zones travelled, the higher the fare. GO transit works like this across the region. Fare pricing everywhere depends on how much the ride is subsidized, though.
Like the breaks for drivers and highway users, eliminating the second fare on local transit will cost something. The province will have to subsidize the fare for the local transit agencies. All fine, and how it works around the world, but this kind thing gets buried in populist announcements, especially when the head of that populist government, Doug Ford, is fond of saying there is only one taxpayer.
Somebody will have to pay for all the transit rides, the untolled highways, and the lack of revenue from plate renewal will have to be made up somewhere or result in cuts. An agency like the TTC has some of the lowest fare subsidies in North America, and increasing these local transit subsidies could be a good thing, but we need to be more honest about who's getting subsidized, and who isn't.
If somebody knocks on your door asking for your vote while bearing treats this spring, ask them how the treats are going to be paid for. It's important to also remember that the previous Liberal government had implemented a $1.50 discount program for riders transferring between the TTC and Metrolinx-operated transit like GO or the UP Express. The Ford government let that expire but, lo, come election year this kind of thing is a good idea after all.
The Toronto Region Board of Trade issued a statement Wednesday saying dropping double fares was a significant step toward an integrated, regionwide transit system, but that excluding the TTC was a mistake and will have economic consequences. "We are in a once-in-a-generation race for talent," said board CEO Jan De Silva in the statement. "Waiting to integrate fares for Toronto locks out talent, especially lower-income earners."
The board has been a long-time advocate for fare integration and a critic of how fragmented the regional transportation system is. Its 2020 report called "Erasing the Invisible Line: Integrating the Toronto Region's Transit Networks" decried "punitive double fares and poorly co-ordinated routes" that made for longer rides and unnecessary crowding.
Despite all the lines on the map, we're all part of one giant megalopolis, criss-crossing it for all kinds of reasons. Making it easy for everyone to do that shouldn't be so political.

Why is Ontario still without a federal deal?: With the end of the fiscal year looming, the clock is ticking for the Ford government

Full text: It has been more than a month since Premier Doug Ford said Ontario was "very, very close" to reaching a deal with the federal government on a new child-care agreement that promises to cut parent fees in half by the end of this year and bring $10-a-day daycare to the province by 2026.
But Karina Gould, the federal minister in charge of the file, said last week she was still waiting for Ontario to submit an action plan for how it will spend its share of the federal funding - $10.2 billion over five years - and that meaningful negotiations can't truly begin until that happens.
Meanwhile, every other province and territory has signed on, and parents in five provinces are already reaping the benefits of dramatic fee reductions.
Ford told reporters this week that a deal will "get done as sure as we're standing here," but he's "not going to do a deal just for making a deal."
With the end of the fiscal year looming, time is running out for Ontario, which will lose the federal money allocated for 2021-22 - more than $1 billion - if a deal isn't reached by March 31.
The Star spoke to several experts to better understand why Ontario's negotiations are taking so long and what's at the heart of the impasse.
What's holding up negotiations?
Ontario wants more money than the federal government is offering and a greater, per-capita share than has already been agreed to by every other province and territory.
Ford's government hasn't specified how much more they want, but they have said Ontario should be credited for the $3.5 billion it spends on full-day kindergarten for children under five, something that is only currently offered in Nova Scotia and the Northwest Territories (although some other provinces are phasing it in).
The federal funding, which was passed in last year's budget, requires separate agreements with each province and territory, accounting for regional differences. But the overall framework and the funding formula are the same. Each jurisdiction's allotment is based on their under-12 population.
The federal plan allows operational subsidies to go to all types of licensed child-care providers to reduce parent fees and increase wages, but restricts funding for new spaces to non-profits. (For-profit businesses currently make up about 25 per cent of all child-care spaces in Ontario.)
Ontario's education minister, Stephen Lecce, who is leading negotiations for the province, has also said he is seeking a more "flexible" deal that gives parents more choice in the type of child-care options available to them, including for-profit and unlicensed home daycares.
"Ontario is expressing a profoundly different vision of child care than the federal government and all the other provinces and territories," said Susan Prentice, a sociology professor at the University of Manitoba and a member of the federal government's expert panel on early learning and child care.
Lecce has also argued that the federal government's plan will not actually get fees down to $10 a day, and he and Ford have said they want more freedom in how they spend the federal money, as well as some guarantee the funding will continue beyond the five-year agreement.
Lecce declined an interview for this story and his office did not respond to specific questions, including why it hasn't yet submitted an action plan.
In a statement, Lecce said he's working with the federal government "to get a better deal for Ontario families," adding that the Ford government wants a deal that is "fiscally sustainable, actually gets prices down to $10 a day, ensures women can get back into the labour market, and helps support our economic recovery."
Do Ontario's arguments make sense?
Generally speaking, no, at least not according to most of the experts interviewed by the Star.
Not only is Ontario not the only province that provides full-day kindergarten to four-year-olds, they said, other provinces spend more on early learning and child care in different ways.
"There are all sorts of things that other provinces have done which cost them more money," said Martha Friendly, executive director and founder of the Childcare Resource and Research Unit. "Ontario is not the only province that has spent more money on something that is special or unique."
Morna Ballantyne, executive director of Child Care Now, said Ontario's funding of full-day junior kindergarten is irrelevant.
"The idea is to use this federal money to build on what already exists," she said. "If Ontario wants to argue that the federal government should pay a share of public education, then they should make that proposal."
But Armine Yalnizyan, an economist, Atkinson Fellow and freelance columnist for the Star, wrote in January that Ford's government is right to push for more money because Ontario's high costs mean $10.2 billion won't be enough to both reduce fees and expand access.
"Most of the federal money would simply go toward lowering the highest parent fees in the country, with little left to add new capacity," she wrote.
The strength of their arguments aside, Ballantyne and others said Ontario doesn't have much negotiating leverage at this point.
"Being the last jurisdiction to sign on, they're in a very weak position to argue that the terms of the agreement that all other jurisdictions have accepted should be changed," Ballantyne said.
It's as if Ontario is asking for a bigger slice of pie when only one slice is left on the plate, said Friendly.
"Everybody agreed that the pie will be divided up in a certain way and then you're the last person to get your piece of pie and you say, 'No, I want a bigger share.' "
Andrea Hannen, the executive director of the Association of Daycare Operators of Ontario, which primarily represents for-profit providers but also includes non-profit members, said it's important for the province to get a deal that "works for all Ontario families" and includes "all elements of the licensed child-care system," including those who run commercial daycares.
They're going to need "all hands on deck," she said, to meet the expected demand. "We're going to need every licensed space that we have, we're going to need every licensed operator that we have, and we're going to need to attract new owner-operators to the system."
But Prentice said the federal government is correct to focus funding for new spaces on non-profits because the evidence points to better outcomes there. "At every level we see better and more efficient results in non-profit systems," she said.
Carolyn Ferns, public policy co-ordinator for the Ontario Coalition for Better Child Care, said expanding the for-profit sector would not be a responsible use of public money. "We really need every dollar of this to go toward reducing fees for families and improving wages for educators," she said.
There is support for Lecce's contention that the federal government has not set aside enough money to actually reduce fees to the extent promised.
Last month, Parliamentary Budget Officer Yves Giroux said the $27.2 billion the Liberals have budgeted for the Canada-wide program would not be enough to meet expected demand. Giroux estimated the shortfall to be about $1 billion.
What if a deal isn't reached by March 31?
All the experts agreed it is unlikely Ford will allow the March 31 deadline to pass without a deal, especially in an election year.
A senior Ontario government official recently told the Star's Robert Benzie that an agreement will be reached well before the June 2 election.
Gould, the federal minister, said this past week she remains optimistic a deal will be done.
"But we're running against the clock," she said, reiterating the need for Ontario to submit its action plan.
Bhutila Karpoche, the Parkdale-High Park MPP and NDP critic on child-care issues, said in an interview that the Ford government's "stalling" has put more than a billion dollars at risk, and it should have negotiated a deal much earlier.
While parents in other provinces are already seeing fees drop, Karpoche said, the opposite is happening in Ontario. "We're not providing the relief for families that they desperately need."
Ballantyne and others also laid the blame for the impasse with Ford's government.
"If there was a major flaw in the federal government's approach then we wouldn't have 12 of 13 jurisdictions having signed on, especially provincial governments of all political stripes," she said.

Full text: It has been more than a month since Premier Doug Ford said Ontario was “very, very close” to reaching a deal with the federal government on a new child-care agreement that promises to cut parent fees in half by the end of this year and bring $10-a-day daycare to the province by 2026.
But earlier this week, Karina Gould, the federal minister in charge of the file, said she was still waiting for Ontario to submit an action plan for how it will spend its share of the federal funding — $10.2 billion over five years — and that meaningful negotiations can’t truly begin until that happens.
Meanwhile, every other province and territory has signed on, and parents in five provinces are already reaping the benefits of dramatic fee reductions.
Ford told reporters this week that a deal will “get done as sure as we’re standing here,” but he’s “not going to do a deal just for making a deal.”
With the end of the fiscal year looming, time is running out for Ontario, which will lose the federal money allocated for 2021-22 — more than $1 billion — if a deal isn’t reached by March 31.
The Star spoke to several experts to better understand why Ontario’s negotiations are taking so long and what’s at the heart of the impasse.
What’s holding up negotiations?
Ontario wants more money than the federal government is offering and a greater, per-capita share than has already been agreed to by every other province and territory.
Ford’s government hasn’t specified how much more they want, but they have said Ontario should be credited for the $3.5 billion it spends on full-day kindergarten for children under five, something that is only currently offered in Nova Scotia and the Northwest Territories (although some other provinces are phasing it in).
The federal funding, which was passed in last year’s budget , requires separate agreements with each province and territory, accounting for regional differences. But the overall framework and the funding formula are the same. Each jurisdiction’s allotment is based on their under-12 population.
The federal plan allows operational subsidies to go to all types of licensed child-care providers to reduce parent fees and increase wages, but restricts funding for new spaces to non-profits. (For-profit businesses currently make up about 25 per cent of all child-care spaces in Ontario.)
Ontario’s education minister, Stephen Lecce, who is leading negotiations for the province, has also said he is seeking a more “flexible” deal that gives parents more choice in the type of child-care options available to them, including for-profit and unlicensed home daycares.
“Ontario is expressing a profoundly different vision of child care than the federal government and all the other provinces and territories,” said Susan Prentice, a sociology professor at the University of Manitoba and a member of the federal government’s expert panel on early learning and child care.
Lecce has also argued that the federal government’s plan will not actually get fees down to $10 a day , and he and Ford have said they want more freedom in how they spend the federal money, as well as some guarantee the funding will continue beyond the five-year agreement.
Lecce declined an interview for this story and his office did not respond to specific questions, including why it hasn’t yet submitted an action plan.
In a statement, Lecce said he’s working with the federal government “to get a better deal for Ontario families,” adding that the Ford government wants a deal that is “fiscally sustainable, actually gets prices down to $10 a day, ensures women can get back into the labour market, and helps support our economic recovery.”
Do Ontario’s arguments make sense?
Generally speaking, no, at least not according to most of the experts interviewed by the Star.
Not only is Ontario not the only province that provides full-day kindergarten to four-year-olds, they said, other provinces spend more on early learning and child care in different ways.
“There are all sorts of things that other provinces have done which cost them more money,” said Martha Friendly, executive director and founder of the Childcare Resource and Research Unit. “Ontario is not the only province that has spent more money on something that is special or unique.”
Morna Ballantyne, executive director of Child Care Now, said Ontario’s funding of full-day junior kindergarten is irrelevant.
“The idea is to use this federal money to build on what already exists,” she said. “If Ontario wants to argue that the federal government should pay a share of public education, then they should make that proposal.”
But Armine Yalnizyan, an economist, Atkinson Fellow and freelance columnist for the Star, wrote in January that Ford’s government is right to push for more money because Ontario’s high costs mean $10.2 billion won’t be enough to both reduce fees and expand access.
“Most of the federal money would simply go toward lowering the highest parent fees in the country, with little left to add new capacity,” she wrote.
The strength of their arguments aside, Ballantyne and others said Ontario doesn’t have much negotiating leverage at this point.
“Being the last jurisdiction to sign on, they’re in a very weak position to argue that the terms of the agreement that all other jurisdictions have accepted should be changed,” Ballantyne said.
It’s as if Ontario is asking for a bigger slice of pie when only one slice is left on the plate, said Friendly.
“Everybody agreed that the pie will be divided up in a certain way and then you’re the last person to get your piece of pie and you say, ‘No, I want a bigger share.’ ”
Andrea Hannen, the executive director of the Association of Daycare Operators of Ontario, which primarily represents for-profit providers but also includes non-profit members, said it’s important for the province to get a deal that “works for all Ontario families” and includes “all elements of the licensed child-care system,” including those who run commercial daycares.
They’re going to need “all hands on deck,” she said, to meet the expected demand. “We’re going to need every licensed space that we have, we’re going to need every licensed operator that we have, and we’re going to need to attract new owner-operators to the system.”
But Prentice said the federal government is correct to focus funding for new spaces on non-profits because the evidence points to better outcomes there. “At every level we see better and more efficient results in non-profit systems,” she said.
Carolyn Ferns, public policy co-ordinator for the Ontario Coalition for Better Child Care, said expanding the for-profit sector would not be a responsible use of public money.
“We really need every dollar of this to go toward reducing fees for families and improving wages for educators,” she said.
There is support for Lecce’s contention that the federal government has not set aside enough money to actually reduce fees to the extent promised.
Last month, Parliamentary Budget Officer Yves Giroux said the $27.2 billion the Liberals have budgeted for the Canada-wide program would not be enough to meet expected demand . Giroux estimated the shortfall to be about $1 billion.
What if a deal isn’t reached by March 31?
All the experts agreed it is unlikely Ford will allow the March 31 deadline to pass without a deal, especially in an election year.
A senior Ontario government official recently told the Star’s Robert Benzie that an agreement will be reached well before the June 2 election.
Gould, the federal minister, said this past week she remains optimistic a deal will be done.
“But we’re running against the clock,” she said, reiterating the need for Ontario to submit its action plan.
Bhutila Karpoche, the Parkdale-High Park MPP and NDP critic on child-care issues, said in an interview that the Ford government’s “stalling” has put more than a billion dollars at risk, and it should have negotiated a deal much earlier.
While parents in other provinces are already seeing fees drop, Karpoche said, the opposite is happening in Ontario. “We’re not providing the relief for families that they desperately need.”
Ballantyne and others also laid the blame for the impasse with Ford’s government.
“If there was a major flaw in the federal government’s approach then we wouldn’t have 12 of 13 jurisdictions having signed on, especially provincial governments of all political stripes,” she said.
Given the looming March 31 deadline, pressure is building on both sides, and Ballantyne suggested they could potentially focus on finding common ground on a one-year agreement to salvage this year’s money, kicking the most contentious issues down the road.
“They may run out of time to be able to work out every detail by March 31,” she said. “But they probably could get far enough along to have a good agreement that would produce really good outcomes for families and for those who work in the sector.”

The pricey politics of transportation: We're seeing plenty of promises to make getting around cheaper, but who will pay for them?

Full text: Getting around the city can be a political act.
It's election season, so getting around is even more political than usual, with commuters of all kinds being wooed with treats. Some commuters more than others, that is.
Last month the Ford government announced licence plate renewal fees are being scrapped. That's an awful lot of money out of the provincial coffers related to infrastructure that takes a lot of wear and tear from motorists and costs an awful lot to keep in a state of good repair. Remember, the rebuilding of a small section of the Gardiner Expressway alone eats up $2 billion, or 38 per cent, of the city of Toronto's 2021-2030 capital budget for transportation. Can we complain about potholes with a plate rebate in our hands?
It's bold to cut this revenue while pushing through the quite-controversial expansion of Highway 413 into the Greenbelt as well as the Bradford Bypass, massive road building that will cost billions. The Ford government offered more treats when it announced it would cancel tolls on Highways 412 and 418. How will that revenue be replaced?
If you ride the TTC or another Ontario transit agency and watched the fares go up and up over the years, you might ask, where's my treat? If tolls are removed from the highway and plates, why can't the tolls on riding the bus, streetcar, or subway be removed?
The Ford government announced last week it would be eliminating "double fares" for riders on trips that connect from GO Transit to local transit services across the Greater Golden Horseshoe, but not including the TTC. It's a very conspicuous omission from a government that has often treated Toronto conspicuously different than it treats other municipalities.
On the face of it, this is a good start in erasing some of the arbitrary borders across our region.
While everyone in the Golden Horseshoe lives in distinct places that are self-governed, when it comes to transportation, we're all one metropolis, living, working and going to school across those borders, part of the same social and economic area. Transportation should be fluid. If you're in a car, save for the welcome sign at the city limits, you barely notice when you cross from one municipality to another. On transit, though, you're much more likely to notice because another fare is required.
Many transit systems around the world have zoned fares. The London Underground is one such system, with six zones that radiate from the city centre in concentric rings. Travelling within the dense first or second zone is a base fare. The more zones travelled, the higher the fare. GO transit works like this across the region. Fare pricing everywhere depends on how much the ride is subsidized, though.
Like the breaks for drivers and highway users, eliminating the second fare on local transit will cost something. The province will have to subsidize the fare for the local transit agencies. All fine, and how it works around the world, but this kind thing gets buried in populist announcements, especially when the head of that populist government, Doug Ford, is fond of saying there is only one taxpayer.
Somebody will have to pay for all the transit rides, the untolled highways, and the lack of revenue from plate renewal will have to be made up somewhere or result in cuts. An agency like the TTC has some of the lowest fare subsidies in North America, and increasing these local transit subsidies could be a good thing, but we need to be more honest about who's getting subsidized, and who isn't.
If somebody knocks on your door asking for your vote while bearing treats this spring, ask them how the treats are going to be paid for. It's important to also remember that the previous Liberal government had implemented a $1.50 discount program for riders transferring between the TTC and Metrolinx-operated transit like GO or the UP Express. The Ford government let that expire but, lo, come election year this kind of thing is a good idea after all.
The Toronto Region Board of Trade issued a statement Wednesday saying dropping double fares was a significant step toward an integrated, regionwide transit system, but that excluding the TTC was a mistake and will have economic consequences. "We are in a once-in-a-generation race for talent," said board CEO Jan De Silva in the statement. "Waiting to integrate fares for Toronto locks out talent, especially lower-income earners."
The board has been a long-time advocate for fare integration and a critic of how fragmented the regional transportation system is. Its 2020 report called "Erasing the Invisible Line: Integrating the Toronto Region's Transit Networks" decried "punitive double fares and poorly co-ordinated routes" that made for longer rides and unnecessary crowding.
Despite all the lines on the map, we're all part of one giant megalopolis, criss-crossing it for all kinds of reasons. Making it easy for everyone to do that shouldn't be so political.

'One lockdown too many': Ontario's election will be a messy affair, and leaders must embrace the uncertainty

Full text: It was only four years ago today that Ontario Progressive Conservative organizers, staff and candidates were consumed by an all-out sprint to elect a new leader — while managing the predictable party infighting, desperate as they were to present a viable alternative to the Wynne Liberals.
Back in 2018, perfectly naturally, many assumed that this would be the strangest, most unpredictable election of Doug Ford’s career. But they would turn out to be wrong.
Now, less than three months away from Ontario’s 43rd provincial election, Premier Ford and his challengers share one common predicament: uncertainty.
The chronic resurgence and retreat of COVID-19, combined with a convergence of social, economic and political changes, have contributed to an incredibly volatile opinion environment in which it’s difficult to measure even the immediate priorities of the electorate, let alone forecast where they are headed.
There is a sense that Ontarians have had “one lockdown too many,” as a Toronto resident put it to me. As public health restrictions are gradually phased out, I am increasingly optimistic that this election will be about much more than managing the pandemic, focused instead on charting a better path forward for Ontario.
Of course, politics is a game of managing expectations. Just as the Trudeau Liberals campaigned on an expansion of temporary pandemic relief programs and an articulation of longer-term priorities last year, the Ford government will have to balance competing pressures.
Key to their success will be outlining a coherent vision that feels relevant and forward-looking, while at the same time anticipating the probability that Omicron is neither the last nor the worst variant we will face. To put it more simply, they need to get on with the great pursuits of government.
Presently, leaders of all major political parties appear to be in a state of paralysis, keeping their cards close until closer to the writ period. For example, earlier this week the Ford government quietly passed legislation that will delay the spring budget without penalty, a move that’s transparently motivated by a desire for a pre-writ, election-friendly budget document.
While Liberal and NDP leaders have criticized the move, neither have taken it as an invitation to fill the void with their own platforms.
In this instance, timidity will do far more harm than audacity. Rather than waiting to communicate a perfect post-pandemic road map, parties should embrace the uncertainty, resist ideological orthodoxies and demonstrate their willingness to evolve as circumstances change at breakneck speed. It will be messy, and Ontario voters will get a meaningful look at the capabilities of their political leaders.
Being adaptive does not mean being unprincipled. Rather, one of the core tenets of strong political leadership is presenting a value set that is resilient to changing circumstances. To that end, Premier Ford can return to his roots as a champion for affordability — a positioning that was central to his 2018 win.
If it worked well in peacetime, it may prove even more relevant after the economic fallout of COVID-19. Or in the face of an unjust war with massive repercussions for logistics, deliveries and consumer prices. For voters with no elasticity in their budget, these are not abstract problems.
Recent commitments to cancel toll roads and scrap licence plate renewal fees have been right on the mark, but Premier Ford’s more persistent affordability challenge will be rising gas prices. While largely out of his control, this challenge has added pressure around his government’s unmet promise to lower prices by 10 cents a litre.
Issues of this scale and complexity are challenging to address publicly during the best of times, let alone when accompanied by the disorder of an election campaign. However, there is no question that Ford’s re-election prospects will be shaped by his ability to rise to the challenge.
Whether additional variants or international developments throw new hurdles in those plans is anybody’s guess. What’s certain is that the peculiarities of our 43rd provincial election are only getting started.

Full text: On Tuesday, we celebrate International Women's Day. Let joy be unconfined, etc.
But admit it, it's difficult in one of the most fraught years in the planet's history to see advancements in women's rights. We're in the shadows. It's a twist on what women are told whenever they ask for a raise: "Now is not the time."
It seems now is not the time for women to close the wage gap, for femicide to decrease, for abusive men to be exiled from the home rather than the women and children they torment, for women to prosper at work while raising children, to retain access to abortion, or even to feel easy about using the word "woman."
No, we have been called "menstruators" and even "chest-feeders" and "pregnant people." When so many of us never did or no longer do menstruate, breastfeed or give birth, we do not exist, I suppose.
This last one is a minor fringe issue, already fading. The others will not fade. Money rules all. Access to money is at the heart of women's advancement, and it's not going well.
As Armine Yalnizyan wrote in the Star in Sept. 2021, "Canada-wide, just 56.7 per cent of the population of women aged 15 and over have paid work, levels last seen in 2002." That was 20 long years ago. Although Quebec and B.C. have recovered to 2016 levels, Ontario is in the backwoods of 1999.
I hope those numbers have gone up as we slowly reopen. Retail jobs sustained so many women. As you walk down the street, look around you. Do you see an open store and if so, is it well-staffed? Should you bother? This is not an anecdote, but a national problem. It's unclear if retailers understand their own shrinkage or the appeal of Amazon.
As our population ages, employment changes. As Yalnizyan put it in another column, do jobs deserve that old "devotion?" Unless caregivers, usually women, are paid fairly with steady, safe work and good benefits, our current crisis will widen again.
Women are seeking to enter new fields in large numbers, including medicine, surgery, trades, law, architecture, possibly policing and the highest reaches of politics. It was a sorrow to see Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott announce her departure from politics. She was the only competent member of Premier Doug Ford's cabinet, and he has always taken care to have no plausible successor in place.
On the other hand, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a feminist, has always advanced the cause of women. Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland has been called "Minister of Everything," having served as minister of international trade, foreign affairs and intergovernmental affairs - and (still) as deputy prime minister.
And she has been strikingly competent in every portfolio, thanks to her intelligence, breadth of knowledge, human understanding and patience. The quality we most need in politicians right now is unflappability, a radiating confidence that problems can indeed be solved.
I see fatigue, rage and panic among citizens. Trudeau has been a calming figure offering careful confidence.
He hasn't been afraid to hand over to Freeland to let her do her finance job, but also to comment publicly on a devastated country she knows well: Ukraine.
Politicians are rarely so generous about the local competition. U.S. President Joe Biden hasn't allowed Vice-President Kamala Harris to range widely, to allow Americans to get to know her. At his age with poor prospects for re-election, the Democrats - and the planet - may pay heavily for this.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson won't leave, partly because he knows voters can see his cabinet is packed with no-hopers. That's his plan. It's not a great one for Britain. He's rather Putin-like that way.
Things to cheer about: abortion pills are becoming more commonly used, the concept of "femicide" as a particular kind of killing is slowly being recognized, #MeToo has finished off many old beasts, and then there's this last crucial fact: women don't give up. We never have. We never will.
Happy International Women's Day, and may we see many more.

Full text: Russia not alone when it comes to foreign invasion
An affront to decency,
Editorial, Feb. 25
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is rightly drawing a lot of condemnation, but some of the statements from our leaders appear to be hypocritical.
As an example, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stated that "Putin has chosen to upend 75 years of peace by invading."
I think this is a little rich. After all, we all remember the invasion of Iraq, when we turned the country upside down as we had (bogus) intelligence that it possessed weapons of mass destruction.
Afghanistan is another country that has been invaded many times - first by Russians, then by NATO.
Palestinian lands continue to be occupied even today.
All this occupation took place during the past 75 years.
The list is not limited to this of course. It includes Vietnam and Yemen and many other countries.
Although we should do what we can to minimize the sufferings of Ukraine, let's not trivialize the sufferings of those who have endured a similar fate.
After all, the devastation caused by a U.S. bomb is equally reprehensible as the one caused by a Russian bomb.

Russians must
be aware this war is not patriotic
Russian troops close in on Kyiv, Feb. 26
I was born four months after the start of the Second World War in Europe, and now a war has just started one month after my 82nd birthday in the same area of Europe, caused by the same kind of meddling maniac.
In 2022, there must be a better way to remove a meddling maniac than fighting him for years and enduring millions of deaths. We are going after his money, but maybe we should be making sure that the Russian people know this is not a great patriotic war. This war is against Putin's made-up enemy, who are not neo-Nazis; they are just fellow Slavs trying to live in peace.

Hungarian refugee's son remembers
In Hungary in the 1950s, my father, John, lived a life of challenges. Never had he experienced freedom, as Magyar Land was oppressed by the Soviets.
Then came the Hungarian Revolution in 1956, and a call to all young people to stand up and be counted for their motherland. John stood up and took on this challenge. Many of his comrades and neighbours fell to Russian bullets. My father was wounded and left for dead, but rose to fight again.
The Soviet-Russian juggernaut had won the day, but only by fleeing could my father and his wife survive.
Thank you, Canada, for your friendship, opportunities and promise.

Ford is taking
all Ontarians
for suckers
So Premier Doug Ford has decided to scrap the very restrictions that have helped save thousands of lives over the past two years.
This premature plan to allow a full reopening of businesses with no need to show vaccination certificates will put lives in danger for the workers and for their customers. Health-care workers cannot catch their breath before the fallout from Ford's decision hits them hard yet again.
Now that an election is coming up, he is resorting to the old trick of bribing the voters with their own money.
P.T. Barnum famously said, "There's a sucker born every minute." In Doug Ford, we have our very own circus ringmaster.

This Ontario government has always made poor decisions because it had its eye on the next election rather than its sworn duty to do what was right for the people of Ontario.
This premature plan to allow a full reopening of businesses with no need to show vaccination certificates will put lives in danger for the workers and for their customers.
The workers in our health-care system cannot catch their breath, with the current lower numbers, before the fallout from Ford’s decision hits them hard yet again.
Now that an election is coming up, he is resorting to the old trick of bribing the voters with their own money. Promising to build highways in areas where he needs to increase support for Conservative candidates, giving up a billion dollars in driver’s licence fees with no plan in the works on how to replace that lost revenue.

Review of usage of Emergencies Act could take months

Full text: It could be months before a review committee delivers its findings on the federal government's unprecedented use of the Emergencies Act, one of its co-chairs said Friday.
"There isn't a scenario where we can get to the bottom of this within a week," NDP MP Matthew Green said in an interview. "I would anticipate this would run well into the summer.
"There ought not be a haste or a rush to get through this process for the sake of getting through it. We have to move through this process deliberately and cautiously."
The federal government used the Emergencies Act for the first time on Feb. 14 to deal with the so-called "Freedom Convoy" occupation in Ottawa and blockades at border crossings. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau revoked the declaration of emergency on Feb. 23.
The task of reviewing how those powers were exercised now falls to a joint House-Senate committee created this week, as required by the act. And although the act states that the committee must submit its report to Parliament within seven sitting days after the declaration is revoked, Green said, "it is a report. It doesn't necessarily, as I understand it, have to be the report."
He said that first report will likely be largely administrative and lay out the processes that the committee will be following in its study.
Green's co-chair, Bloc Québécois MP Rhéal Fortin, concurred. "We have no choice," Fortin said. "The committee has just been formed ... Maybe there will be a preliminary report, but it's clear we won't have enough time to do it all."
The NDP voted with the government to confirm the invocation of the Emergencies Act last month, while the Bloc opposed it along with the Conservatives.
Despite the act's seven-day deadline, there are exceptional circumstances at play. The act's architect, Perrin Beatty, told the Star that it was envisioned that emergencies would be fairly lengthy. He said the idea was that the committee would be created as soon as Parliament confirmed the declaration of emergency, to provide real-time oversight, as well as scrutiny after the fact.
In this case, the declaration of emergency was in place for a little over a week, having been confirmed by the House of Commons, but was revoked even before it could be confirmed by the Senate.
"I'm not sure a great deal of thought was given to what happens if the situation on the ground has improved so dramatically before Parliament even gets to vote on the invocation of the act itself," said Beatty, who introduced the act in 1987 as defence minister in Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservative government.
The act refers to holding some hearings behind closed doors in certain circumstances, but Green committed to making the committee's work as public as possible. He also said it was his understanding that members will be given the required clearance to review security information.
Green and Fortin will co-chair the committee with Sen. Gwen Boniface from the Independent Senators Group, who was unavailable for an interview Friday.

Embracing uncertainty

Full text: It was only four years ago today that Ontario Progressive Conservative organizers, staff and candidates were consumed by an all-out sprint to elect a new leader - while managing the predictable party infighting, desperate as they were to present a viable alternative to the Wynne Liberals.
Back in 2018, perfectly naturally, many assumed that this would be the strangest, most unpredictable election of Doug Ford's career. But they would turn out to be wrong.
Now, less than three months away from Ontario's 43rd provincial election, Premier Ford and his challengers share one common predicament: uncertainty.
The chronic resurgence and retreat of COVID-19, combined with a convergence of social, economic and political changes, have contributed to an incredibly volatile opinion environment in which it's difficult to measure even the immediate priorities of the electorate, let alone forecast where they are headed.
There is a sense that Ontarians have had "one lockdown too many," as a Toronto resident put it to me. As public health restrictions are gradually phased out, I am increasingly optimistic that this election will be about much more than managing the pandemic, focused instead on charting a better path forward for Ontario.
Of course, politics is a game of managing expectations. Just as the Trudeau Liberals campaigned on an expansion of temporary pandemic relief programs and an articulation of longer-term priorities last year, the Ford government will have to balance competing pressures.
Key to their success will be outlining a coherent vision that feels relevant and forward-looking, while at the same time anticipating the probability that Omicron is neither the last nor the worst variant we will face. To put it more simply, they need to get on with the great pursuits of government.
Presently, leaders of all major political parties appear to be in a state of paralysis, keeping their cards close until closer to the writ period. For example, earlier this week the Ford government quietly passed legislation that will delay the spring budget without penalty, a move that's transparently motivated by a desire for a pre-writ, election-friendly budget document.
While Liberal and NDP leaders have criticized the move, neither have taken it as an invitation to fill the void with their own platforms.
In this instance, timidity will do far more harm than audacity. Rather than waiting to communicate a perfect post-pandemic road map, parties should embrace the uncertainty, resist ideological orthodoxies and demonstrate their willingness to evolve as circumstances change at breakneck speed. It will be messy, and Ontario voters will get a meaningful look at the capabilities of their political leaders.
Being adaptive does not mean being unprincipled. Rather, one of the core tenets of strong political leadership is presenting a value set that is resilient to changing circumstances. To that end, Premier Ford can return to his roots as a champion for affordability - a positioning that was central to his 2018 win.
If it worked well in peacetime, it may prove even more relevant after the economic fallout of COVID-19. Or in the face of an unjust war with massive repercussions for logistics, deliveries and consumer prices. For voters with no elasticity in their budget, these are not abstract problems.
Recent commitments to cancel toll roads and scrap licence plate renewal fees have been right on the mark, but Premier Ford's more persistent affordability challenge will be rising gas prices. While largely out of his control, this challenge has added pressure around his government's unmet promise to lower prices by 10 cents a litre.
Issues of this scale and complexity are challenging to address publicly during the best of times, let alone when accompanied by the disorder of an election campaign. However, there is no question that Ford's re-election prospects will be shaped by his ability to rise to the challenge.
Whether additional variants or international developments throw new hurdles in those plans is anybody's guess. What's certain is that the peculiarities of our 43rd provincial election are only getting started.

Martin Regg Cohn: Without Christine Elliott, will Doug Ford revert to form?

Full text: Four years ago, Christine Elliott ran to be leader of Ontario’s Progressive Conservatives.
Now, the province’s powerful deputy premier is walking away from it all.
She’s not alone.
Elliott is the 18th MPP elected alongside Doug Ford in the 2018 “change” election to now change their mind in the aftermath. That’s an exodus amounting to almost one-quarter of the 76 MPPs described by Ford as his “all-star” team — though some stars dimmed, fell into disrepute, were dumped from cabinet or devolved into anti-vax dissidents.
Never before have so many politicians opted to get out when the going was so good for the governing party. As polarizing as the premier is, he’s still sitting pretty in public opinion polls — with 39 per cent support, far ahead of the opposition Liberals and NDP tied at 27 per cent each, according to the latest Leger survey.
Which is what makes so many of these departures so novel.
Elliott is quitting not for fear of defeat, she is resigning to avoid winning re-election. She dreamed of power four years ago, but now realizes you’d best be careful what you wish for — lest you win four more years with Ford.
Rod Phillips, who worked closely with Elliott on pandemic management, made a similar calculation when he quit suddenly in January. Phillips had his ups and downs — he lost the finance portfolio after taking a Caribbean vacation mid-pandemic — but he was brought back into cabinet to clean up the mess in long-term care.
Both were known for their quiet expertise. Now they are both quietly exiting.
Their departures speak volumes about what they put up with over the last four years, and what the province might face without them over the next four.
Phillips and Elliott were the main guardrails keeping Ford in his lane and on course, lest he go over a cliff. They could speak truth to power even when he wasn’t always of a mind to listen.
“From the day she became my deputy, we’ve never had a disagreement,” Ford mused Friday at a joint appearance with Elliott.
In fact, Elliott criticized him severely when they were rival leadership candidates, but the premier always gave her a hearing when they worked together in government. That’s because everyone understood that she was the one minister he could never fire from cabinet — too popular, too much profile, too much pandemic.
Now, she has fired her boss.
Leadership aspirants like her only bide their time until their time is up. Elliott first ran for the PC leadership in 2009 (losing to Tim Hudak), tried a second time in 2015 (beaten by Patrick Brown), and then quit her seat in a funk.
She made a third leadership bid in 2018, losing narrowly to Ford but not before promising to come back as an MPP win or lose. Elliott kept her word, but the writing was on the wall.
In her own mind, she was the deputy premier who should have been premier. Serving as deputy was not what she signed up for, and so she resigned one last time on Friday.
After all, Elliott is not about to try a fourth time for the top job. And Phillips had too much baggage from his past travels to continue his forward journey in politics.
They will be missed. Amid Ford’s flamboyance, Elliott and Phillips were the competent grown-ups in the cabinet room, even if they weren’t always centre stage during COVID-19.
Ford tended to hold the microphone, handing it off mostly to the medical officer of health. But behind the scenes, the ministerial tag team of Elliott and Phillips oversaw the hospitals and long-term facilities that are the backbone of the system, while also backstopping the bureaucracy.
On their watch, Ontario mostly weathered the pandemic storm. For all the media alarmism and epidemiological partisanship of the past two years, the province consistently delivered the most cautious COVID-19 restrictions on the continent, among the best vaccine distribution networks (notably boosters for younger adults), and the best outcomes, all things considered.
Without them in cabinet, Ford will be more out of balance — less ballast and more bluster.
Without COVID-19 in his sights, he may be more out of step — less mission-focused and more mischief-making.
The pandemic served as an additional guardrail, keeping Ford’s eyes — and mouth — on the road ahead. He softened his rough edges, dialed down his puerile populist rhetoric, and acted more like a grown-up in government.
Without the enforced discipline from COVID-19 and his cabinet lieutenants, will the premier revert to form , embracing his past penchant for baubles and bombast in the coming campaign — and beyond? Elliott and Phillips weren’t willing to wait to find out — a telltale clue for the rest of us.

Full text: It could be months before a review committee delivers its findings on the federal government’s unprecedented use of the Emergencies Act, one of its co-chairs said Friday.
“There isn’t a scenario where we can get to the bottom of this within a week,” NDP MP Matthew Green said in an interview. “I would anticipate this would run well into the summer.
“There ought not be a haste or a rush to get through this process for the sake of getting through it. We have to move through this process deliberately and cautiously.”
The federal government used the Emergencies Act for the first time on Feb. 14 to deal with the so-called Freedom Convoy occupation in Ottawa and blockades at border crossings. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau revoked the declaration of emergency on Feb. 23.
The task of reviewing how those powers were exercised now falls to a joint House-Senate committee created this week , as required by the act. And although the act states that the committee must submit its report to Parliament within seven sitting days after the declaration is revoked, Green said, “it is a report. It doesn’t necessarily, as I understand it, have to be the report.”
He said that first report will likely be largely administrative and lay out the processes that the committee will be following in its study.
Green’s co-chair, Bloc Québécois MP Rhéal Fortin, concurred. “We have no choice,” Fortin said. “The committee has just been formed ... Maybe there will be a preliminary report, but it’s clear we won’t have enough time to do it all.”
The NDP voted with the government to confirm the invocation of the Emergencies Act last month, while the Bloc opposed it along with the Conservatives.
Despite the act’s seven-day deadline, there are exceptional circumstances at play. The act’s architect, Perrin Beatty, told the Star that it was envisioned that emergencies would be fairly lengthy. He said the idea was that the committee would be created as soon as Parliament confirmed the declaration of emergency, to provide real-time oversight as well as scrutiny after the fact.
In this case, the declaration of emergency was in place for a little over a week, having been confirmed by the House of Commons , but was revoked even before it could be confirmed by the Senate.
“I’m not sure a great deal of thought was given to what happens if the situation on the ground has improved so dramatically before Parliament even gets to vote on the invocation of the act itself,” said Beatty, who introduced the act in 1987 as defence minister in Brian Mulroney’s Progressive Conservative government.
The act refers to holding some hearings behind closed doors in certain circumstances, but Green committed to making the committee’s work as public as possible. He also said it was his understanding that members will be given the required clearance to review security information.
Fortin said he’d like to see Trudeau and the ministers of public safety and justice testify, along with chiefs of police, adding he believes other opposition parties would push for the same.
“In my mind, it’s inevitable” that Trudeau would be called, Fortin said in an interview. “I think that accounts of cabinet meetings, testimonies from the ministers and the prime minister, those seem to be essentials to me.”
Green and Fortin will co-chair the committee with Sen. Gwen Boniface from the Independent Senators Group, who was unavailable for an interview Friday.
Also on the committee from the House will be Liberal MPs Yasir Naqvi, Rachel Bendayan and Arif Virani, and Conservatives Larry Brock and Glen Motz. And the other Senate members will be Claude Carignan from the Conservatives, Peter Harder from the Progressive Senate Group, and Vernon White from the Canadian Senators Group.
The government’s motion creating the committee passed the House of Commons on Wednesday with NDP and Bloc support, and was confirmed by the Senate. The government argued that neither the Liberals nor the Conservatives should co-chair, given the former invoked the Emergencies Act and the latter expressed support for the protests that led to its invocation.
The Tories rejected the proposal, saying that traditionally, oversight committees are chaired by the Official Opposition.
The bickering over the committee’s structure has led experts to question how useful the committee will be. Green said he will be meeting with committee members and staff in the coming days to ensure the review doesn’t “devolve into a hyperpartisan circus.”

Full text: OTTAWA—A two-week break for the House of Commons that began Friday is setting the stage for an uptick in action in the federal Conservative leadership race.
Former MP Leona Alleslev is now adding her name to the list of candidates eyeing a run, while the one official candidate so far has nabbed a major endorsement and several other campaigns are gearing up to formally launch bids.
Alleslev was defeated in the last federal election in the GTA riding of Aurora-Oak Ridges-Richmond Hill, a loss that contributed to concerns that former leader Erin O’Toole could not lead the party to victory if he couldn’t help win ridings like hers.
Now Alleslev is heeding calls to seek the leadership that followed O’Toole’s departure in February and is gathering a team, money and the signatures needed to enter the race, the Star has learned.
“If I had to lay odds, I would say she’s going to get in,” said one party insider familiar with Alleslev’s efforts.
“I do know she has a vision for a modern, inclusive country and a Conservative party with broad appeal that she is eager to articulate.”
Alleslev did not return a request for comment from the Star.
Alleslev was first elected as a Liberal in 2015, but crossed the floor to the Conservatives in 2018, citing dissatisfaction with the Liberals on a number of files, including the economy and military spending. She’s a former captain in the Air Force.
She’d go on to become Conservative deputy leader under Andrew Scheer, but stepped down to join Peter MacKay’s campaign during the 2020 leadership contest. She then lost her seat to Liberal Leah Taylor Roy in the September 2021 election.
Candidates for the Conservative leadership race have to pay a $200,00 entry fee, plus a $100,000 refundable deposit.
They have until April 19 to apply to enter, and a new leader will be elected by Sept. 10.
So far, there’s only one official contestant, longtime MP Pierre Poilievre.
He’s on a campaign tour in Saskatchewan and is expected to receive Scheer’s endorsement at a Friday rally.
Though Scheer quit as leader under a cloud of controversy in 2020, he retains a position of prominence inside caucus and the party, and his imprimatur will carry weight.
Poilievre will also be travelling in Quebec, Ontario and Western Canada in the coming days.
Former Quebec premier and one-time federal Progressive Conservative party leader Jean Charest is also expected to make his candidacy official in the coming days.
MP and former leadership candidate Leslyn Lewis is expected to launch next week, and two-time MP Scott Aitchison, Ontario MPP Roman Baber and conservative strategist Tasha Kheiriddin are also mulling bids.

Shawn Micallef: Doug Ford has doled out election treats to drivers and some transit riders. But guess who's getting taken for a ride?

Full text: Getting around the city can be a political act.
It’s election season, so getting around is even more political than usual, with commuters of all kinds being wooed with treats. Some commuters more than others, that is.
Last month the Ford government announced licence plate renewal fees are being scrapped. That’s an awful lot of money out of the provincial coffers related to infrastructure that takes a lot of wear and tear from motorists and costs an awful lot to keep in a state of good repair. Remember, the rebuilding of a small section of the Gardiner Expressway alone eats up $2 billion, or 38 per cent, of the city of Toronto’s 2021-2030 capital budget for transportation . Can we complain about potholes with a plate rebate in our hands?
It’s bold to cut this revenue while pushing through the quite-controversial expansion of Highway 413 into the Greenbelt as well as the Bradford Bypass, massive road building that will cost billions. The Ford government offered more treats when it announced it would cancel tolls on Highways 412 and 418. How will that revenue be replaced?
If you ride the TTC or another Ontario transit agency and watched the fares go up and up over the years, you might ask, where’s my treat? If tolls are removed from the highway and plates, why can’t the tolls on riding the bus, streetcar, or subway be removed?
This week the Ford government announced it would be eliminating “double fares” for riders on trips that connect from GO Transit to local transit services across the Greater Golden Horseshoe, but not including the TTC. It’s a very conspicuous omission from a government that has often treated Toronto conspicuously different t han it treats other municipalities .
On the face of it, this is a good start in erasing some of the arbitrary borders across our region. While everyone in the Golden Horseshoe lives in distinct places that are self-governed, when it comes to transportation, we’re all one metropolis, living, working and going to school across those borders, part of the same social and economic area. Transportation should be fluid. If you’re in a car, save for the welcome sign at the city limits, you barely notice when you cross from one municipality to another. On transit, though, you’re much more likely to notice because another fare is required.
Many transit systems around the world have zoned fares. The London Underground is one such system, with six zones that radiate from the city centre in concentric rings. Travelling within the dense first or second zone is a base fare. The more zones travelled, the higher the fare. GO transit works like this across the region. Fare pricing everywhere depends on how much the ride is subsidized, though.
Like the breaks for drivers and highway users, eliminating the second fare on local transit will cost something. The province will have to subsidize the fare for the local transit agencies. All fine, and how it works around the world, but this kind of thing gets buried in populist announcements, especially when the head of that populist government, Doug Ford, is fond of saying there is only one taxpayer.
Somebody will have to pay for all the transit rides, the untolled highways, and the lack of revenue from plate renewal will have to be made up somewhere or result in cuts. An agency like the TTC has some of the lowest fare subsidies in North America, and increasing these local transit subsidies could be a good thing, but we need to be more honest about who’s getting subsidized, and who isn’t.
If somebody knocks on your door asking for your vote while bearing treats this spring, ask them how the treats are going to be paid for. It’s important to also remember that the previous Liberal government had implemented a $1.50 discount program for riders transferring between the TTC and Metrolinx-operated transit like GO or the UP Express. The Ford government let that expire but, lo, come election year this kind of thing is a good idea after all.
The Toronto Region Board of Trade issued a statement Wednesday saying dropping double fares was a significant step towards an integrated, region-wide transit system, but that excluding the TTC was a mistake and will have economic consequences. “We are in a once-in-a-generation race for talent,” said board CEO Jan De Silva in the statement. “Waiting to integrate fares for Toronto locks out talent, especially lower-income earners.”
The board has been a long-time advocate for fare integration and a critic of how fragmented the regional transportation system is. Its 2020 report called “Erasing the Invisible Line: Integrating the Toronto Region’s Transit Networks” decried “punitive double fares and poorly coordinated routes” that made for longer rides and unnecessary crowding.
Despite all the lines on the map, we’re all part of one giant megalopolis, criss-crossing it for all kinds of reasons. Making it easy for everyone to do that shouldn’t be so political.

MPP Elliott won't seek re-election in June: Health minister will continue to shepherd Ontario through pandemic until late spring vote

Full text: Premier Doug Ford is losing a key player as Health Minister Christine Elliott - also his deputy premier - says she won't run in the June 2 provincial election.
Elliott confirmed her pending retirement Friday following news reports on her decision.
"Between now and this spring, Premier Ford has asked me to continue to support our government as minister of health and I have agreed without hesitation," she said, calling her 13 years as an MPP "a great honour, a great responsibility."
Elliott, 66, is a lawyer by training. She has been in charge of the high-profile health portfolio throughout the pandemic, a role that attracted protesters to her home, sometimes into the early morning hours.
"After two-plus years of COVID, she deserves to have her life back," one source told the Star.
During a stop at Sunnybrook hospital with Elliott on Friday, Ford paid tribute to her for shepherding the Health Ministry through a critical time.
"I'm very grateful that Christine's going to stay on until the election and help us go through this pandemic, as we're coming out of it slowly," he said.
Elliott ran three times for the leadership of the Progressive Conservatives, losing close contests to Patrick Brown in 2015 and Ford in 2018. She also ran in 2009 against Tim Hudak.
The veteran MPP was first elected in Whitby-Oshawa in 2006. She took three years off from electoral politics after her 2015 leadership defeat and served as Ontario's first patient ombudsman, a $220,000-a-year role to which she was appointed by former Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne. Elliott had been her party's outspoken health critic.
She took a pay cut when she quit that job, unsuccessfully sought the leadership and subsequently won re-election to the legislature in Newmarket-Aurora four years ago.
Elliott is the second high-profile minister to announce a retirement from politics this year.
Businessman and former finance and environment minister Rod Phillips resigned the long-term-care portfolio last month to return to private life.
The PCs quickly announced Dawn Gallagher Murphy, a consultant who has been Elliott's community office manager in Newmarket-Aurora, will be the party's candidate in the riding.
Elliott is among 18 PCs elected in Ford's 2018 sweep of the previous Liberal government who are not running again under the party banner because they are in other parties, sitting as independents, refused to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or are leaving politics.
They include Independent MPP Randy Hillier (Lanark-Frontenac-Kingston), an outspoken opponent of public health measures to fight COVID-19, who said Thursday night he will not seek re-election. Hillier has been censured unanimously in the legislature twice recently for discreditable conduct.

Full text: Ontario’s transportation minister insists the province is not letting truck drivers from the so-called Freedom Convoy protests “off the hook” amid criticisms that penalties have not gone far enough.
Caroline Mulroney said the provincial state of emergency declared by Premier Doug Ford allowed police to suspend the licences and tow vehicles for a week without any right to appeal, which “provided more certainty that would allow them to clear the occupation in short order.”
But New Democrat Leader Andrea Horwath and other opposition parties were not buying that rationale after Ford warned truckers who participated in the protest against COVID-19 measures could face fines of $100,000 and a year in prison for resisting efforts to clear them out.
“The occupiers are literally driving away in the very trucks they used to occupy Ottawa,” Horwath said Thursday following reports that 39 vehicles seized by police were returned to their owners.
“Residents find out now that the $100,000 penalties that this premier was blustering about were all for show, as usual ... he’s sending a pretty dangerous signal that the kind of lawlessness that took place will have no consequences.”
Solicitor General Sylvia Jones said Ottawa police have laid a range of mischief and other criminal charges against dozens in the “illegal occupation,” with some remaining in jail while they seek bail.
“Any suspensions processed remain on the vehicle record and could affect the renewal of licences in the future,” she added.
Liberal house leader John Fraser, the MPP for Ottawa South, faulted Ford for waiting two weeks into the occupation to declare an emergency.
“I’ve never felt so let down,” he told reporters, suggesting Ford’s Progressive Conservative MPPs in suburban Ottawa could face difficulty in the June 2 election because residents of the nation’s capital were so frustrated.
Fraser said a major concern is the sudden departure of three Ford government appointees to the Ottawa police services board after the provincial politics publication QP Briefing revealed one of them attended a protest rally.
“This raises more questions than it answers,” Fraser said, wondering aloud if any sensitive information on police strategy was provided to protest organizers or participants.
Jones said the three provincial appointees will be replaced in the next few days.
“Because the city of Ottawa has chosen to take a new direction with their police services board, we accepted the resignations of the three,” she said.
Ford said the province makes about 3,500 appointments a year and, while he signs off on them, he can’t “dig into” all of them.

Full text: Four years ago, Christine Elliott ran to be leader of Ontario's Progressive Conservatives.
Now, the province's powerful deputy premier is walking away from it all.
She's not alone.
Elliott is the 18th MPP elected alongside Doug Ford in the 2018 "change" election to now change their mind in the aftermath. That's an exodus amounting to almost one-quarter of the 76 MPPs described by Ford as his "all-star" team - though some stars dimmed, fell into disrepute, were dumped from cabinet or devolved into anti-vax dissidents.
Never before have so many politicians opted to get out when the going was so good for the governing party. As polarizing as the premier is, he's still sitting pretty in public opinion polls - with 39 per cent support, far ahead of the opposition Liberals and NDP tied at 27 per cent each, according to the latest Léger survey.
Which is what makes so many of these departures so novel.
Elliott is quitting not for fear of defeat, she is resigning to avoid winning re-election. She dreamed of power four years ago, but now realizes you'd best be careful what you wish for - lest you win four more years with Ford.
Rod Phillips, who worked closely with Elliott on pandemic management, made a similar calculation when he quit suddenly in January. Phillips had his ups and downs - he lost the finance portfolio after taking a Caribbean vacation mid-pandemic - but he was brought back into cabinet to clean up the mess in long-term care.
Both were known for their quiet expertise. Now they are both quietly exiting.
Their departures speak volumes about what they put up with over the last four years, and what the province might face without them over the next four.
Phillips and Elliott were the main guardrails keeping Ford in his lane and on course, lest he go over a cliff. They could speak truth to power even when he wasn't always of a mind to listen.
"From the day she became my deputy, we've never had a disagreement," Ford mused Friday at a joint appearance with Elliott.
In fact, Elliott criticized him severely when they were rival leadership candidates, but the premier always gave her a hearing when they worked together in government. That's because everyone understood that she was the one minister he could never fire from cabinet - too popular, too much profile, too much pandemic.
Now, she has fired her boss.
Leadership aspirants like her only bide their time until their time is up. Elliott first ran for the PC leadership in 2009 (losing to Tim Hudak), tried a second time in 2015 (beaten by Patrick Brown), and then quit her seat in a funk.
She made a third leadership bid in 2018, losing narrowly to Ford but not before promising to come back as an MPP win or lose. Elliott kept her word, but the writing was on the wall.
In her own mind, she was the deputy premier who should have been premier. Serving as deputy was not what she signed up for, and so she resigned one last time on Friday.
After all, Elliott is not about to try a fourth time for the top job. And Phillips had too much baggage from his past travels to continue his forward journey in politics.
They will be missed. Amid Ford's flamboyance, Elliott and Phillips were the competent grown-ups in the cabinet room, even if they weren't always centre stage during COVID-19.
Ford tended to hold the microphone, handing it off mostly to the medical officer of health. But behind the scenes, the ministerial tag team of Elliott and Phillips oversaw the hospitals and long-term facilities that are the backbone of the system, while also backstopping the bureaucracy.
On their watch, Ontario mostly weathered the pandemic storm. For all the media alarmism and epidemiological partisanship of the past two years, the province consistently delivered the most cautious COVID-19 restrictions on the continent, among the best vaccine distribution networks (notably boosters for younger adults), and the best outcomes, all things considered.
Without them in cabinet, Ford will be more out of balance - less ballast and more bluster.
Without COVID-19 in his sights, he may be more out of step - less mission-focused and more mischief-making.
The pandemic served as an additional guardrail, keeping Ford's eyes - and mouth - on the road ahead. He softened his rough edges, dialed down his puerile populist rhetoric, and acted more like a grown-up in government.
Without the enforced discipline from COVID-19 and his cabinet lieutenants, will the premier revert to form, embracing his past penchant for baubles and bombast in the coming campaign - and beyond? Elliott and Phillips weren't willing to wait to find out - a telltale clue for the rest of us.

Martin Regg Cohn: Green Leader Mike Schreiner stands out among MPPs. So why does his party have a popularity problem?

Full text: Mike Schreiner has an image problem.
Not him, his brand.
As leader of Ontario’s Green Party, he keeps outperforming his political rivals on the provincial stage. He is articulate and authentic, passionate and persuasive.
But that’s only half the story — his personal success story on the eve of an Ontario election campaign.
The other half is the hard part — the tough story of last September’s federal election.
That’s when Canada’s Greens self-destructed on the national campaign trail. The fallout was far and wide.
The fight against global warming was overshadowed by a civil war within a national party that couldn’t stop talking about war in the Middle East. Its high-profile leader, Annamie Paul , went down in a ball of flames and its voter support vanished.
In truth, Schreiner had nothing to do with that cross-country disaster. In fact, Ontario’s Green Party is a separate entity.
But in politics, perception counts. In reality, the Green movement is one big global brand with blurred boundaries.
Now, Schreiner must juggle brand management and damage control, while still trying to win over the province and save the planet. That means outshining the rival leaders of Ontario’s major parties, but also outrunning the ghosts of the Green Party of Canada.
Schreiner prefers to face the elephant in the room head on, rather than pretend no one sees it. At a recent Ryerson Democracy Forum that I hosted for Ontario’s three opposition party leaders, he heard a recurring audience question :
What happened to the federal Greens, and what does it mean for Ontario?
“I’m a straight shooter — there’s no doubt there was a lot of turmoil within the federal party over the last year,” Schreiner replied.
“But I want to be very clear with people: the Ontario Greens are a separate party with a different organizational culture and governance structure,” he stressed. “While the federal party was going through its turmoil, we set a record for the most fundraising we’ve ever, ever had in a year in our party’s history. We have more volunteers than we ever had, we have the largest staff.”
That’s the inescapable irony: Schreiner finds himself in an enviable position provincially despite the unenviable decline of his counterparts federally.
Today, 14 years after taking over the party, he has spearheaded breakthroughs that Greens had long waited for. Schreiner won the party’s first seat in Guelph in the last election, and the party has recruited a star candidate — former provincial environment commissioner Dianne Saxe — to serve as deputy leader and run in the Toronto riding of University-Rosedale.
He is also building out a broader campaign platform that goes beyond environmental issues, including an ambitious mental health framework to be released Thursday and a housing plan that won plaudits last year.
When he rises in the legislature, Schreiner stands out. As leader of a caucus of one, he is not only the superior debater and speechmaker, but a more quotable media interlocutor outside the house.
It’s hard not to notice that his comments often appear higher up in reporters’ stories than those from rival opposition parties. That may be a reflection of a built-in media bias for his clarity and accessibility over obfuscation and deflection — and the comparison with others will be obvious when he debuts in televised election debates (he was shut out in the past for lacking a seat).
But Schreiner’s ability to grow as a politician doesn’t mean he can keep growing the Green seat count. His breakthrough in Guelph owed much to the 2018 collapse of the Liberal vote, and while he is destined to be re-elected it won’t be easy to to translate his popularity further afield.
Public opinion polling shows the provincial Greens ranging from three to 10 per cent support over the last couple of years, usually hovering at about five per cent (with a noticeable softening after the federal party started crumbling early last year). That said, voters tend to ignore Ontario politics until the campaigns begin.
With three months until voting day on June 2, Schreiner understands that Ontario’s Greens must distinguish themselves from their provincial rivals — but also distance themselves from the federal Greens.
“Sometimes adversity can make you stronger,” he says. “Some of the adversity that the party went through at the federal level, we can learn from that at the provincial level.”
Ontario’s Greens must make the case against global warming, but that’s only half the story. Apart from climate change, they also need to show an understanding of the province’s political environment — and learn lessons from the fate of their federal cousins.

Full text: Premier Doug Ford is losing a key player as Health Minister Christine Elliott — also his deputy premier — says she won’t run in the June 2 provincial election.
Elliott confirmed her pending retirement Friday following news reports on her decision.
“Between now and this spring, Premier Ford has asked me to continue to support our government as minister of health and I have agreed without hesitation,” she said, calling her 13 years as an MPP “a great honour, a great responsibility.”
Elliott, 66, is a lawyer by training. She has been in charge of the high-profile health portfolio throughout the pandemic, a role that attracted protesters to her home, sometimes into the early morning hours.
“After two-plus years of COVID, she deserves to have her life back,” one source told the Star.
During a stop at Sunnybrook hospital with Elliott on Friday, Ford paid tribute to her for shepherding the Health Ministry through a critical time.
“I’m very grateful that Christine’s going to stay on until the election and help us go through this pandemic, as we’re coming out of it slowly,” he said.
Elliott ran three times for the leadership of the Progressive Conservatives, losing close contests to Patrick Brown in 2015 and Ford in 2018. She also ran in 2009 against Tim Hudak.
The veteran MPP was first elected in Whitby-Oshawa in 2006. She took three years off from electoral politics after her 2015 leadership defeat and served as Ontario’s first patient ombudsman , a $220,000-a-year role to which she was appointed by former Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne. Elliott had been her party’s outspoken health critic.
She took a pay cut when she quit that job, unsuccessfully sought the leadership and subsequently won re-election to the legislature in Newmarket-Aurora four years ago.
Elliott is the second high-profile minister to announce a retirement from politics this year. Businessman and former finance and environment minister Rod Phillips resigned the long-term-care portfolio last month to return to private life.
The PCs quickly announced Dawn Gallagher Murphy, a consultant who has been Elliott’s community office manager in Newmarket-Aurora, will be the party’s candidate in the riding.
Elliott is among 18 PCs elected in Ford’s 2018 sweep of the previous Liberal government who are not running again under the party banner because they are in other parties, sitting as independents, refused to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or are leaving politics.
They include Independent MPP Randy Hillier (Lanark-Frontenac-Kingston), an outspoken opponent of public health measures to fight COVID-19, who said Thursday night he will not seek re-election. Hillier has been censured unanimously in the legislature twice recently for discreditable conduct.

Lewis mulls second leadership bid: In last go-round, MP won support of social conservatives

Full text: Leslyn Lewis is expected to officially enter the federal Conservative leadership race next week, a contest starting to take shape after the release of several key deadlines.
Lewis, a lawyer who is now an MP, ran for the leadership in 2020.
Despite starting off as a relative unknown, she swept up support first from social conservatives and then from many grassroots party members turned off by the two front-runners, Erin O'Toole and Peter MacKay.
She ultimately placed third.
A source close to Lewis said she's still waiting to see the fine print on the rules and if there are no major surprises, she will enter the race.
"We're in it to win," a source, granted anonymity to discuss the internal dynamics at play, told the Star.
Lewis may not be the only woman in the race.
Conservative strategist Tasha Kheiriddin is also considering a bid, telling the Star on Thursday she is continuing to weigh all of her options.
MP Scott Aitchison (Parry Sound-Muskoka) said Thursday he is also considering running but is waiting for the details on the rules.
"I am building a team that will bring Canadians and our party together," he said in a statement.
Also considering running are Ontario MPP Roman Baber and longtime Tory MP Michael Chong.
Candidates have until April 19 to apply to enter, and will have to pay $200,000, plus a refundable $100,000 deposit.
The schedule to make those payments might trip up a candidate.
The only officially declared candidate - Pierre Poilievre - has been raising money and is on tour, spending Thursday in Saskatchewan decrying the federal carbon tax.
Former Quebec premier and federal Progressive Conservative party Jean Charest has verbal pledges for financial support.
If he formally launches, as expected, his biggest push will be to sign up new members who will back his bid.
He held one-on-one meetings with Conservative MPs in Ottawa Thursday, after hosting a reception for them on Wednesday evening
Charest has also said the rules will tell him whether a campaign is viable and if he will have enough time to sign up members.
Charest's campaign already has the support of a number of Quebec MPs, but lawmakers from Nova Scotia, Ontario and Alberta were among those in the crowd.
So far, Poilievre leads in endorsements from MPs, with close to 30 already backing the parliamentary veteran. Charest has support from several Quebec MPs, as well as some from Ontario and Nova Scotia.
Lewis had seven caucus endorsements in 2020, but one has already decamped for Poilievre, one didn't get re-elected, and a third - Scott Reid - is now the caucus chair, so will remain neutral.
Whether caucus endorsements matter or not depends, said longtime Conservative strategist Michael Diamond, who worked on leadership campaigns in 2020 and 2017 but is sitting this one out.
"If someone is willing to go to war for you, that's good," he said. "But if it's just someone who posts a message, it doesn't have any impact."
MPs can play a role in helping sign up new members, a process that eventually helps them too, since every new name feeds into the party's broader voter database.
To vote in the race, members must sign up by June 3.
How many may eventually do that could depend on another potential candidate.
Patrick Brown, currently mayor of Brampton and a former federal MP, is considered one of the savviest and best-connected political organizers in the conservative movement.
He too is mulling a bid, and insiders say he'd have no trouble signing up thousands of people to support him.
One thing potentially stopping Brown is timing.
The last race happened against the complicated backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, this one will run concurrently with elections in Quebec and Ontario.
In Quebec, ballots will be cast in October, the same month as Ontario's municipal elections.
Ontario's provincial vote is on June 2.
Not only does that mean the focus for many conservatives will be divided among the various races, it's a bigger issue for Brown, Diamond said.
He'll have to make a decision whether he wants to take another crack at federal politics or stay local.
Municipal candidates must register to run by mid-August.
By then, ballots for the federal leadership race will already be in the mail, with the winner expected to be announced on Sept. 10.

Full text: Here’s the problem.
Social assistance benefit levels are not indexed in Ontario. In real terms, they have fallen so far for so long that no political party except the Greens has promised to restore them to where they stood before the Harris cuts of 1995.
If the provincial government were to restore rates to where they were before the cuts, the Ontario Works (OW) single rate would have to climb by 67 per cent from $733 a month to $1,108 a month. Similarly, the Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP) would also have to climb by 67 per cent from $930 to $1,554 a month.
Increases like that would cost billions of dollars, and serious government contenders will choose to spend those billions elsewhere. (The Greens have said they would double ODSP rates, but they won’t get the chance to fulfil that promise.)
There have been no increases since 2018; they are for now frozen in time. It would take an eight per cent increase just to restore their pre-pandemic purchasing power.
To put that in perspective, the single combined maximum benefit level for Old Age Security recipients along with the Guaranteed Income Supplement rate for low-income seniors was $1,463 a month in mid-2018, and is $1,602 a month now following eight scheduled increases since then.
There are various benchmarks that parties could use for promises to raise rates. However, politicians fear them all since they would derive little political credit from advocates and activists for doing so.
They would likely say “too little, too late” — and they would be right.
So, let’s lower the bar and ask political parties to pledge to raise rates to the amount Mike Harris cut them to in 1995.
If that pledge became a reality, the OW single rate would climb by 16.2 per cent from $733 a month to $852 a month. And let’s ask for a similar 16.2 per cent increase to ODSP to take the single rate from $1,169 to $1,359 a month.
How would we pay for it?
Since the beginning of the pandemic in spring 2020, the number of social assistance beneficiaries has fallen by 14 per cent, or over 142,000 beneficiaries in November 2021.
A 16.2 per cent increase could be fully funded by the money saved by paying fewer people since the pandemic’s onset.
Where we live in North Scarborough, the lowest advertised rent for a shared room in an illegal rooming house is $500 a month. A reasonable diet costs over $200 a month (the threadbare welfare diet costs $187). This leaves $33 left over for a phone, internet, clothing, utensils, transit, personal care and everything else.
In other words, living on the remaining $33 now paid in addition to the cheapest room and a sketchy diet is impossible. An extra $119 a month would mean a little less destitution, and the impossible would at least become remotely conceivable.
Let’s see if anyone steps up and promises “16.2 in ’22.”

Full text: The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Friday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available .
6:07 p.m. Canada is rescheduling 11 planeloads of rapid COVID-19 tests that were due to be delivered this month, via Russian cargo jets, reports The Canadian Press.
A Russian-owned cargo plane successfully delivered a shipment of tests to Canada Sunday morning at Pearson Airport, according to CP.
Hours later Transport Minister Omar Alghabra announced Canada was closing its airspace to all Russian aircraft, effective immediately, in response to Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and that plane remains grounded in Toronto.
Eleven more shipments of rapid tests were to be delivered this month on Russian planes but have all been cancelled.
A spokesman for Public Services and Procurement Minister Filomena Tassi says most have found new planes already, though the Russian planes can typically carry more and a small number of the deliveries have yet to find space on a cargo plane that can land in Canada.
Since January 1, 300 million rapid tests have been delivered to the federal government, which is buying them mainly on behalf of provincial governments.
Legislation to approve $2.5 billion in funding to Health Canada to buy and distribute the tests received royal assent Friday. That was on top of $1.7 billion approved in the fall fiscal update also for rapid tests.
Chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam said at her weekly briefing Friday that the easier access to rapid tests will help Canada in the event of another wave of COVID-19.
Early in the Omicron wave access to rapid tests became a massive problem, as infection rates soared and public health systems couldn’t keep up with demand for PCR tests in person.
That demand has now dropped along with infection rates, and Tam said that after months of high infection rates from Omicron and Canada’s high vaccination uptake, there are high levels of immunity to the variant across the country.
Because of testing limitations there is not yet good data on how many people got Omicron, she said. Since Omicron became the dominant variant in Canada in mid-December, 1.3 million cases were confirmed but only a small fraction of infections are now being recorded.
Ontario’s chief medical officer of health Dr. Kieran Moore said this week the actual number in his province is likely 10 times the reported figure.
“I do think that if it’s Omicron that’s circulating in the next month, we have a very good level of protection in the community, particularly with boosters protecting against severe outcomes,” Tam said. “But if there’s a variant that’s very different to Omicron, then that’s a different story and we will have to re-evaluate the risk of any vaccine-evasive variants.”
Tam said even if such a variant arrives, there are more treatment options for COVID-19, including the recently approved Paxlovid antiviral drug from Pfizer, as well as more access to rapid tests, a better understanding of the virus’s transmission, the benefits of good ventilation and easy access to masks.
She said with all of those measures “we’ve got to be able to go into the fall and winter season, or indeed the next wave if it should come in between, with much more ability to respond without those really severe restrictions. That is the goal.”
Tam did urge health systems to take the time they have now to invest in surge capacity so if another wave arrives, we don’t need to turn to drastic closures to keep hospitals from getting overwhelmed.
She said possibly reconsidering how we license international health professionals to help in Canada could come into play, as could finding efficiencies by using virtual care.
Tam also said face masks should be kept on hand as the first line of defence against COVID-19 even if they are not mandatory.
Alberta and Saskatchewan lifted mask mandates this week, with Manitoba following mid-month, Ontario possibly by month’s end and Quebec by the middle of April.
She said she personally will look at local infection rates and the risk to her or her family members from COVID-19 to determine when or if she will stop wearing a mask.
Infection rates have continued to fall this week, as have hospitalizations and the number of people in intensive care.
The number of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 peaked on Jan. 22 at 11,022, with 1,233 of them in intensive care. As of Feb. 28, there were 5,136 people in hospital with COVID-19, and 570 in intensive care. That’s down more than 15 per cent in the last week alone.
Tam said people can help avoid another serious wave by getting vaccinated. Public Health Canada data show that since vaccines became available in Canada, unvaccinated and partly vaccinated individuals accounted for 58 per cent of all cases and 75 per cent of all hospitalizations.
4:13 p.m. Nova Scotia has reported four new COVID-19-related deaths, bringing the total number of deaths in the province to 212, reports The Canadian Press.
Officials say the most recent deaths involve a man in his 50s from the northern zone, a man in his 70s from the eastern zone and two men in their 80s from the northern and western zones, according to CP.
A total of 294 new lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported.
There are now 45 people in hospital due to the disease, including 13 in ICU.
Officials estimate there are now 2,650 active cases of COVID-19 in Nova Scotia.
Nova Scotia will be moving to weekly reporting, and the next COVID-19 release and dashboard update will be sent out on Thursday.
3:50 p.m. Montreal public health officials were against the COVID-19 curfew that the province imposed last December, because little data existed on its effectiveness and out of concern for the most vulnerable, government documents reveal, reports The Canadian Press.
Internal documents released by the Health Department indicate Montreal officials expressed concern over limited scientific data to support a curfew as an effective means of reducing COVID-19 transmission. City officials also cited pandemic fatigue, impact on vulnerable groups such as domestic violence victims, and the worry that a curfew would encourage people to adopt riskier behaviours, according to CP.
The ethics review was prepared by the city’s health officials during the hard-hitting wave of the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus, when the Health Department was considering what restrictions to impose to reduce transmission.
Radio-Canada initially received the ethics review by Montreal officials through an access to information request — but the entirety of its contents was redacted. Following outcry from the opposition and journalists, the Health Department released the full review late Thursday.
Legault imposed the curfew on Dec. 31, 2021, forbidding Quebecers from leaving their homes between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. He lifted the order two weeks later on Jan. 17. He had imposed a curfew earlier in 2021 for almost five months, between January and May. Quebec was the only province to prohibit its citizens from leaving their homes at night as a way to control COVID-19 transmission.
The documents also show that the province’s former public health director, Dr. Horacio Arruda, was looking for evidence to justify the December curfew only hours before it was announced.
Meanwhile, Quebec has reported 16 more deaths due to COVID-19 on Friday and a 51-patient drop in the number of people hospitalized with the disease. There were 1,313 people in hospital with COVID-19, after 88 people were admitted in the past 24 hours and 139 people were discharged. The number of people in intensive care rose by four, to 80.
Quebec announced earlier this week that it would lift most public health orders, including indoor capacity limits and the vaccine passport requirement, on March 12, which is two days earlier than previously announced.
Mask mandates in all public places except public transportation will be lifted by mid-April at the latest, the government said.
3:02 p.m. Canada’s chief public health officer says that, as long as Omicron remains the dominant variant of COVID-19 in Canada, the risk of another massive wave of infections is low, reports The Canadian Press.
Dr. Theresa Tam says the number of cases of Omicron in recent months, coupled with Canada’s high vaccination rates, created good community-level protection against COVID-19 for now, according to CP.
She warns that if another variant emerges that is significantly different from Omicron, and able to evade current vaccines, that could change.
But even in that scenario, she says better treatments and more availability of rapid tests make it unlikely that more disruptive measures such as school closures and gathering limits will be needed.
Tam says face masks should be kept on hand as the first line of defence against COVID-19 even if they are not mandatory.
2:59 p.m. Canada’s chief public health officer says that as long as Omicron remains the dominant variant of COVID-19 in Canada, the risk of another massive wave of infections is low.
Dr. Theresa Tam says the number of cases of Omicron in recent months, coupled with Canada’s high vaccination rates, created good community-level protection against COVID-19 for now.

Alberta and Saskatchewan lifted mask mandates this week, with Manitoba following mid-month, Ontario possibly by month’s end and Quebec by the middle of April.
2:55 p.m. Ege Kok had been searching for weeks for somewhere in her north Toronto neighbourhood where she could easily get a booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.
She’d received her second dose last summer but found it tough to secure a third when the province made them available for all Ontarians in late December.
This week, while scouring the internet for pop-up clinics, she learned of a walk-in site opening at a local library branch just a 10-minute bus ride away from her home. By Thursday afternoon, both 31-year-old Kok and her mother were able to get their boosters in the library’s glass-walled conference room where half a dozen vaccine stations had been set up.
The library clinic is part of the City of Toronto’s new “Vax and Read” campaign that launched this week as part of a hyper-local strategy to target areas with low vaccine uptake. Twelve public libraries will host walk-in vaccine clinics on various days until March 16.
2:45 p.m. Newfoundland and Labrador health authorities say 16 people are hospitalized with the disease, one more than reported during the last update on Wednesday.
Of those, the number of people in intensive care remains unchanged at six.
The province reported 497 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday and 450 today for a total of 947 new infections since Wednesday.
2:22 p.m. This time, it feels different.
Although Toronto concert venues — and clubs especially — were allowed 100 per cent capacity for six weeks in late 2021 before the Omicron surge hit, the lifting of restrictions feels like it’s more final than in other incarnations.
Shaun Bowring, owner of Toronto clubs The Garrison (capacity 350) and The Baby G (capacity 150), agreed.
“It seems in general that public health guidance and governments are at the point where they’re saying, ‘OK, we’re living with this and we’re hopefully headed into an endemic.’ That seems to be something that’s happening globally, not just locally or provincially.”
Whether this is a move by the Ontario government that’s borne out of COVID fatigue, public interest, mental health or a combination of all those factors, Bowring, who is happy that his clubs are back at full capacity, wishes they would have been given a little more notice.

12:56 p.m. Four athletes set to compete at the Tim Hortons Brier have yet to make the trip to Lethbridge, Alta., after testing positive for COVID-19 on their pre-departure PCR tests, Curling Canada said Friday in a statement.
Each competitor plays on a different team, the federation said, without identifying any of the athletes. The players remain in isolation in their respective hometowns.
Round-robin play was scheduled to begin Friday night at the Enmax Centre. Competition continues through March 13.
12:21 p.m. U.S. businesses stepped up their hiring last month as the Omicron faded and more Americans ventured out to spend at restaurants, shops, and hotels despite surging inflation.
Employers added 678,000 jobs in February, the largest monthly total since July, the Labor Department reported Friday. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.8%, from 4% in January, extending a sharp decline in joblessness to its lowest level since before the pandemic erupted two years ago.
Friday’s hiring figures were collected before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has sent oil prices jumping and has heightened risks and uncertainties for economies in Europe and the rest of the world.
Yet the February hiring data suggest that two years after COVID-19 sparked a nationwide shutdown and 22 million job losses, the disease is losing its grip on America’s economy. More people are taking jobs or searching for work — a trend that, if it endures, will help ease the labor shortages that have bedeviled employers for the past year.
12:04 p.m. New York City will lift mandates next week requiring masks in public schools and proof of vaccination to dine in restaurants or enter entertainment, sports and cultural venues, Mayor Eric Adams announced Friday.
Standing in Times Square, Adams said that while the COVID-19 pandemic isn’t over, he was confident that it is now safe to send children to school unmasked.
“We want to see the faces of our children. We want to see their smiles,” the mayor said, adding that parents could continue to send their kids to school with face coverings if they wished.
The mayor, a Democrat, last weekend said he would lift the mandates if infections and hospitalizations continued a downward trend. He stressed that the mandates could be re-imposed if a new variant emerges that, like Omicron, poses a special danger.
11:52 a.m. Quebec is reporting 16 more deaths due to COVID-19 and a 51-patient drop in the number of people hospitalized with the disease.
There are 1,313 people in hospital with COVID-19, after 88 people were admitted in the past 24 hours and 139 people were discharged.
The number of people in intensive care rose by four, to 80.
Health officials are reporting another 1,354 COVID-19 infections detected through PCR testing, which is restricted to certain groups.
11:30 a.m. Canada’s Laurent Dubreuil has tested positive for COVID-19 at the world speedskating championships, sinking his chance at claiming the men’s sprint title.
Speed Skating Canada released a statement from Dubreuil confirming the positive test shortly before Friday’s races were set to begin.
Dubreuil sat first in the men’s overall sprint standings following Thursday’s races after winning the first 500-metre sprint and finishing third in the first 1,000-metre race.
Sprint champions are decided after two races over 500 metres and two over 1,000. The final sprint races were all scheduled to take place Friday.
10:17 a.m. (updated) Ontario is reporting 262 people in ICU due to COVID-19 and 821 in hospital overall testing positive for COVID-19, according to its latest report released Friday morning.
Of the people hospitalized, 44 per cent were admitted for COVID-19 and 56 per cent were admitted for other reasons but have since tested positive. For the ICU numbers, 80 per cent were admitted for COVID-19 and 20 per cent were admitted for other reasons but have since tested positive.
Given new provincial regulations around testing that took effect Dec. 31, 2021, case counts — reported at 2,085 on Friday, down eight per cent from the previous day — are also not considered an accurate assessment of how widespread COVID-19 is right now; 28 virus-related new deaths were reported in the latest numbers.

9:13 a.m. (updated) The City of Toronto has announced that major events will proceed immediately — meaning Pride, the Toronto International Film Festival and other in-person celebrations will be permitted for the first time in two years.
Mayor John Tory made the announcement at the TIFF Bell Lightbox on Friday morning, signalling the next phase of re-opening in the city almost 24 months since the provincial government first declared an emergency over COVID-19.

8:28 a.m. (updated): Premier Doug Ford is losing another key member of his cabinet as Health Minister Christine Elliott — also his deputy premier — says she won’t run in the June 2 provincial election.
Elliott confirmed her pending retirement in a statement Friday morning, following news reports Thursday night .
“After considerable reflection and discussion with my family, it is with deep gratitude for my 16 years in public life that I recently shared with Premier Ford I will not be seeking re-election in the upcoming provincial contest in June,” she wrote.
“Between now and this spring, Premier Ford has asked me to continue to support our government as minister of health and I have agreed without hesitation.”

7:50 a.m. Toronto Mayor John Tory is set to make an announcement about Toronto’s festivals and in-person events at 9 a.m. on Friday.
7:35 a.m. March 1 marked a big day in Ontario, with proof of vaccination no longer required for workplaces, and capacity limits for indoor public settings being lifted.
With restrictions slowly being lifted, many workers are wondering what masking policies they will face as they slowly return to in-person work at the office.
The government of Ontario requires that people wear masks in the workplace if they are unable to stay at least two metres apart. In a common space, boardroom meeting, lunch room, people can be unmasked only if they’re a safe distance from one another.

7:10 a.m. Toronto high school student Evan Woo is “done” with wearing masks in class.
Not only does he miss seeing his friends’ faces — and would love to know what some teachers look like beneath the nose — but he says masks are a “barrier” to learning because voices are muffled.
“Sometimes it’s hard to hear someone speaking two desks down from where I’m sitting,” said the Grade 12 student at Earl Haig Second, ary School.

5:45 a.m.: Long-standing inequities in education, housing and employment in Nova Scotia’s Black communities have been amplified by COVID-19, according to community leaders who are trying to collect better race-based data on the pandemic.
Those same issues have left African Nova Scotians vulnerable to misinformation about the disease, said David Haase, with the Health Association of African Nova Scotians, or HAAC.
“When COVID came along, we recognized that there was misinformation, mainly on social media, that the community was seeing and absorbing,” Haase said during a recent interview. “Things like, ‘Black people are not as easily infected,’ which is the opposite to the reality, we realized.”
The last two years have been particularly difficult for the province’s Black community, many of whom are descendants of American Loyalists who arrived in Nova Scotia in the 1780s, as a result of the American Revolution.
John Ariyo, director of equality and engagement with the province, said in an interview last week, “COVID has actually uncovered ... some of the inequalities in our communities when it comes to Black residents.”
Friday 5:42 a.m.: The markets are crowded again. Traffic is jamming the roads. Migrant workers have returned to the cities. And young people are back at schools and universities — many of them for the first time in years.
It isn’t quite how things were before the COVID-19 pandemic — mask mandates still exist in some places — but with infections steadily declining, life in South Asia is returning to a sense of normalcy.
The mental scars from last year’s delta-driven surge persist — especially in India, where health systems collapsed and millions likely died — but across the region high vaccination rates and hope that the highly contagious Omicron variant has helped bolster immunity are giving people reasons to be optimistic.
While experts agree that opening up was the right move amid falling case numbers, they caution that optimism should be tempered with lessons from the past two years.

Will social assistance rates be an election issue?

Full text: Here's the problem: Social assistance benefit levels are not indexed in Ontario. In real terms, they have fallen so far for so long that no political party except the Greens has promised to restore them to where they stood before the Harris cuts of 1995.
If the province were to restore rates to where they were before the cuts, the Ontario Works single rate would have to climb by 67 per cent from $733 a month to $1,108 a month. Similarly, the Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP) would also have to climb 67 per cent from $930 to $1,554 a month.
Increases like that would cost billions of dollars, and serious government contenders will choose to spend those billions elsewhere. (The Greens have said they would double ODSP rates, but they won't get the chance to fulfil that promise.)
There have been no increases since 2018; they are for now frozen in time. It would take an eight per cent increase just to restore their pre-pandemic purchasing power.
To put that in perspective, the single combined maximum benefit level for old age security recipients along with the guaranteed income supplement rate for low-income seniors was $1,463 a month in mid-2018, and is $1,602 a month now following eight scheduled increases since then.
There are various benchmarks that parties could use for promises to raise rates. However, politicians fear them all since they would derive little political credit from advocates and activists for doing so.
They would likely say "too little, too late" - correctly.
So, let's lower the bar and ask political parties to pledge to raise rates to the amount Mike Harris cut them to in 1995.
If that pledge became a reality, the OW single rate would climb by 16.2 per cent from $733 a month to $852 a month. And let's ask for a similar 16.2 per cent increase to ODSP to take the single rate from $1,169 to $1,359 a month.
How would we pay for it?
Since the beginning of the pandemic in spring 2020, the number of social assistance beneficiaries has fallen by 14 per cent, or over 142,000 beneficiaries in November 2021.
A 16.2 per cent increase could be fully funded by the money saved by paying fewer people since the pandemic's onset.
Where we live in North Scarborough, the lowest advertised rent for a shared room in an illegal rooming house is $500 a month. A reasonable diet costs over $200 a month (the threadbare welfare diet costs $187). This leaves $33 for a phone, internet, clothing, utensils, transit, personal care and everything else.
In other words, living on the remaining $33 now paid in addition to the cheapest room and a sketchy diet is impossible. An extra $119 a month would mean a little less destitution, and the impossible would at least become remotely conceivable.
Let's see if anyone steps up and promises "16.2 in '22."

Full text: OTTAWA—Leslyn Lewis is expected to officially enter the federal Conservative leadership race next week, a contest starting to take shape after the release of several key deadlines.
Lewis, a lawyer who is now an MP, ran for the leadership in 2020. Despite starting off as a relative unknown, she swept up support first from social conservatives and then from many grassroots party members turned off by the two front-runners, Erin O’Toole and Peter MacKay.
She ultimately placed third.
A source close to Lewis said she’s still waiting to see the fine print on the rules and if there are no major surprises, she will enter the race.
“We’re in it to win,” a source, granted anonymity to discuss the internal dynamics at play, told the Star.
Lewis may not be the only woman in the race.
Conservative strategist Tasha Kheiriddin is also considering a bid, telling the Star on Thursday she’s continuing to weigh her options.
MP Scott Aitchison (Parry Sound-Muskoka) said Thursday he is also considering running but is waiting for the details on the rules.
“I am building a team that will bring Canadians and our party together,” he said in a statement.
Also considering running are Ontario MPP Roman Baber and longtime Tory MP Michael Chong.
Candidates have until April 19 to apply to enter, and will have to pay $200,000, plus a refundable $100,000 deposit.
The schedule to make those payments might trip up a candidate. The only officially declared candidate — Pierre Poilievre — has been raising money and is on tour, spending Thursday in Saskatchewan decrying the federal carbon tax.
Former Quebec premier and federal Progressive Conservative party Jean Charest has verbal pledges for financial support. If he formally launches, as expected, his biggest push will be to sign up new members who will back his bid.
He held one-on-one meetings with Conservative MPs in Ottawa Thursday, after hosting a reception for them on Wednesday evening.
So far, Poilievre leads in endorsements from MPs, with close to 30 already backing the parliamentary veteran. Charest has support from several Quebec MPs, as well as some from Ontario and Nova Scotia.
Lewis had seven caucus endorsements in 2020, but one has already decamped for Poilievre, one didn’t get re-elected, and a third — Scott Reid — is now the caucus chair, so will remain neutral.
Whether caucus endorsements matter or not depends, said longtime Conservative strategist Michael Diamond, who worked on leadership campaigns in 2020 and 2017 but is sitting this one out.
“If someone is willing to go to war for you, that’s good,” he said. “But if it’s just someone who posts a message, it doesn’t have any impact.”
MPs can play a role in helping sign up new members, a process that eventually helps them too, since every new name feeds into the party’s broader voter database. To vote in the race, members must sign up by June 3.
How many may eventually do that could depend on another potential candidate.
Patrick Brown, currently mayor of Brampton and a former federal MP, is considered one of the savviest and best-connected political organizers in the conservative movement.
He too is mulling a bid, and insiders say he’d have no trouble signing up thousands of people to support him.
One thing potentially stopping Brown is timing.
The last race happened against the complicated backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, this one will run concurrently with elections in Quebec and Ontario.
In Quebec, ballots will be cast in October, the same month as Ontario’s municipal elections. Ontario’s provincial vote is on June 2.
Not only does that mean the focus for many conservatives will be divided among the various races, it’s a bigger issue for Brown, Diamond said.
He’ll have to make a decision whether he wants to take another crack at federal politics or stay local.
Municipal candidates must register to run by mid-August.
By then, ballots for the federal leadership race will already be in the mail, with the winner expected to be announced on Sept. 10.

Full text: As Ontario lifts restrictions, immunocompromised and other vulnerable people feel left out of the party, Feb. 28
I can relate to this article, because of my medical situation, as I’m sure many other people do. When Doug Ford said, “We have to learn to live with (COVID-19),” my immediate reaction was, “Great! I need to learn how not to die from COVID.”
Do I expect all public health guidelines to remain in force as numbers continue to improve?
No.
I do expect consideration be given to people like me and others who are at risk, by maintaining mask mandates, continuing with the vaccination campaign, and expanding testing for more accurate positivity numbers, so that we can have some semblance of safety.
I also wish people would respect physical distancing, especially when they are not masked. They might feel safe being close to me; I don’t feel the same way.
It is all about respect.

Ontario on track to lift COVID-19 mask mandates this month, top doctor says

Full text: Ontario will lift mask mandates “by the end of March” if positive trends continue, even as the more contagious BA.2 strain of COVID-19 becomes dominant and wastewater shows infection levels rising during the province’s reopening.
That’s the message from chief medical officer Dr. Kieran Moore, who said Thursday a continued decline in hospitalizations and high booster shot levels among the most vulnerable are making the move possible.
“We can only mandate masking for so long,” Moore told a news conference, noting his office is monitoring data and is assuming actual infection levels are 10 times higher than shown by limited PCR testing.
That means Tuesday’s confirmed case count of another 2,262 Ontarians testing positive for COVID-19 actually represents something more like 23,000 new cases.
The masking change could be announced as soon as next Thursday, when Moore holds his last scheduled weekly briefing of the pandemic.
Premier Doug Ford said at a separate event in Toronto’s west end that he is waiting on a recommendation from Moore and hopes the mask mandate is lifted “as soon as possible.” Several days ago, the premier, who is up for re-election June 2, suggested masking could be lifted after March break.
While the BA.2 variant of COVID-19 is 30 per cent more contagious than the Omicron strain — which sparked a sudden fifth wave of the pandemic — and is expected to dominate in Ontario by mid-month, it does not appear to be causing an increase in hospitalizations.
“The only concern is that increased transmissibility factor, so it can spread quite quickly. There are some studies that show a very small risk of reinfection,” said Moore, who pointed to a “strong wall of defence” from vaccination and widespread levels of Omicron infection since early December.
Without widespread PCR testing, which was scrapped before Christmas amid the Omicron onslaught, Ontario is relying on wastewater testing that shows rates of new COVID-19 infections had stabilized and are “just slowly going up in many regions across Ontario,” Moore added.
That correlates with the reopening, but he expects that trend to stabilize given high immunization levels.
Moore said the lifting of mask mandates does not mean the dangers of COVID-19 are over and recommended people with medical conditions that put them in greater danger from the virus continue wearing masks in indoor public spaces and other situations where they feel it is appropriate.
“The risk remains,” he said.
Moore has indicated previously that mask mandates may remain in hospitals, nursing homes and on public transit even after they are lifted in most indoor public spaces and schools.

Full text: Divesting from fossil fuels should be next
More than 100 Canadian business leaders vow to sell off Russian investments - and call on other investors to do the same, March 2
I applaud the business leaders pulling their money out of Russia as a response to its invasion of Ukraine. Any individual divestment will have an effect, even if it is small. Perhaps more importantly, it involves the business leaders at a moral level in the response to the war and the threat it poses.
It is my hope these leaders will then see we face a much greater threat from the climate crisis that is upon us, and join with those of us who are divesting from oil, coal and gas.
After all, fossil fuels are the main sources of the gases that are causing climate change, which in turn causes between several hundred thousand to several million excess deaths per year, depending on the study cited.
Surely climate change also demands moral and practical responses from all of us, including business leaders.
Dave Kempton, Newmarket
We are at war for the future of our democracy
It is amazing that little old me in Sharbot Lake has been attacked by bots (robot Facebook accounts with no followers), because I posted Mark Carney's follow-the-money editorial about the convoy occupiers of Ottawa. Both my Sharbot Lake Business Group and my personal Facebook accounts were attacked.
Less than 1,000 folks shut down our capital, causing $1 billion in damages - never mind 30,000 residents having to be assaulted by horns 24/7 and harassed individually for 21 days.
The source of this is pro-Putin American and Russian money producing slick videos to make the vulnerable angry enough to try to bring down Canada's government. Trudeau and Freeland are the targets.
Putin's invasion of Ukraine is supported by Trump and his followers. Trump calls Canada a tyranny and supports the convoy occupiers.
We can no longer be naive about how world war is conducted, and how money and social media have no boundaries.
We are at war for the future of our democracy.
Ken Fisher, Sharbot Lake, Ont.
NATO, Biden partly to blame for Ukraine war
'Putin was wrong. We were ready', Mar. 2
Joe Biden's revival of his unity agenda, as Edward Keenan points out, may save his party from defeat at the midterm elections, but it is at the cost of Ukrainian lives lost in a war that he provoked.
Putin was wrong to invade, but the U.S.-led NATO countries must share the responsibility for this outcome by refusing to negotiate a security agreement with Russia over at least the last two decades.

Greens' Schreiner should be more popular

Full text: Mike Schreiner has an image problem.
Not him, his brand.
As leader of Ontario's Green Party, he keeps outperforming his political rivals on the provincial stage. He is articulate and authentic, passionate and persuasive.
But that's only half the story - his personal success story on the eve of an Ontario election campaign.
The other half is the hard part - the tough story of last September's federal election.
That's when Canada's Greens self-destructed on the national campaign trail. The fallout was far and wide.
The fight against global warming was overshadowed by a civil war within a national party that couldn't stop talking about war in the Middle East. Its high-profile leader, Annamie Paul, went down in a ball of flames and its voter support vanished.
In truth, Schreiner had nothing to do with that cross-country disaster. In fact, Ontario's Green Party is a separate entity.
But in politics, perception counts. In reality, the Green movement is one big global brand with blurred boundaries.
Now, Schreiner must juggle brand management and damage control, while still trying to win over the province and save the planet. That means outshining the rival leaders of Ontario's major parties, but also outrunning the ghosts of the Green Party of Canada.
Schreiner prefers to face the elephant in the room head on, rather than pretend no one sees it. At a recent Ryerson Democracy Forum that I hosted for Ontario's three opposition party leaders, he heard a recurring audience question:
What happened to the federal Greens, and what does it mean for Ontario?
"I'm a straight shooter - there's no doubt there was a lot of turmoil within the federal party over the last year," Schreiner replied.
"But I want to be very clear with people: the Ontario Greens are a separate party with a different organizational culture and governance structure," he stressed. "While the federal party was going through its turmoil, we set a record for the most fundraising we've ever, ever had in a year in our party's history. We have more volunteers than we ever had, we have the largest staff."
That's the inescapable irony: Schreiner finds himself in an enviable position provincially despite the unenviable decline of his counterparts federally.
Today, 14 years after taking over the party, he has spearheaded breakthroughs that Greens had long waited for.
Schreiner won the party's first seat in Guelph in the last election, and the party has recruited a star candidate - former provincial environment commissioner Dianne Saxe - to serve as deputy leader and run in the Toronto riding of University-Rosedale.
He is also building out a broader campaign platform that goes beyond environmental issues, including an ambitious mental health framework to be released Thursday and a housing plan that won plaudits last year.
When he rises in the legislature, Schreiner stands out.
As leader of a caucus of one, he is not only the superior debater and speechmaker, but a more quotable media interlocutor outside the house.
It's hard not to notice that his comments often appear higher up in reporters' stories than those from rival opposition parties. That may be a reflection of a built-in media bias for his clarity and accessibility over obfuscation and deflection - and the comparison with others will be obvious when he debuts in televised election debates (he was shut out in the past for lacking a seat).
But Schreiner's ability to grow as a politician doesn't mean he can keep growing the Green seat count. His breakthrough in Guelph owed much to the 2018 collapse of the Liberal vote, and while he is destined to be re-elected, it won't be easy to translate his popularity further afield.
Public opinion polling shows the provincial Greens ranging from three to 10 per cent support over the last couple of years, usually hovering at about five per cent (with a noticeable softening after the federal party started crumbling early last year). That said, voters tend to ignore Ontario politics until the campaigns begin.
With three months until voting day, Schreiner understands that Ontario's Greens must distinguish themselves from their provincial rivals - but also distance themselves from the federal Greens.
"Sometimes adversity can make you stronger," he says. "Some of the adversity that the party went through at the federal level, we can learn from that at the provincial level."
Ontario's Greens must make the case against global warming, but that's only half the story. Apart from climate change, they also need to show an understanding of the province's political environment - and learn lessons from the fate of their federal cousins.

Full text: Premier Doug Ford is about to lose another key member of his cabinet as Ontario’s spring election approaches.
Health minister and deputy premier Christine Elliott will not run for the Progressive Conservatives in the June 2 vote, sources said Thursday night.
Elliott, 66 and a lawyer by training, has been in charge of the high-profile health portfolio throughout the pandemic, a role that attracted anti-restrictions protesters to her home at times.
“After two-plus years of COVID she deserves to have her life back,” one source told the Star after CBC first reported her pending departure.
Neither Elliott nor government officials replied to requests for comment.
Elliott ran three times for the Progressive Conservative leadership, losing close contests to Patrick Brown in 2015 and Doug Ford in 2018 following Brown’s sudden resignation. She also ran in 2009 against Tim Hudak.
The veteran MPP took three years off from electoral politics after her 2015 leadership defeat and served as Ontario’s first patient ombudsman , a $220,000-a-year role to which she was appointed by former Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne. Elliott had been her party’s outspoken health critic.
She took a pay cut when she quit the job, unsuccessfully sought the leadership and subsequently won re-election to the legislature in Newmarket-Aurora four years ago.
Elliott is the second high-profile minister to quit Ford's cabinet this year. Businessman and former finance and environment minister Rod Phillips resigned the long-term care portfolio last month to return to private life.
Several of Ford’s MPPs have also announced they will not run in the June election.

Jean Charest mulls foray into Tory leadership race

Full text: OTTAWA—Longtime Quebec politician Jean Charest was greeted with hugs and applause late Wednesday in what was his first public foray into the leadership race for the federal Conservative party.
The stakes are high for the former federal Progressive Conservative leader, already being slammed as a Liberal by other federal Tories.
But Charest was jovial when asked on his way into the small reception — held in the aptly-named Quebec room of the famous Chateau Laurier hotel — whether he was going to run.
“Where to?” he joked.
In earnest, Charest said he was waiting for the rules of the race itself to be revealed before making a decision.
The party released a few details late Wednesday: The new leader will be selected by Sept. 10, and candidates will have until June 3 to sign up new members.
That deadline is key, sources close to Charest had said earlier, as it will help them decide whether they can sign up enough people in time to be able to win.
Charest said there is one thing he knows already.
“One thing that I believe to be very important is to have a national Conservative party that is able to represent every part of Canada,” he said.
“It’s really our responsibility to be that national political party.”
Charest said the rules will tell him whether a campaign is viable — will he have enough time to sign up members is a key point, his team told the Star.
Charest’s campaign already has the support of a number of Quebec MPs, but lawmakers from Nova Scotia, Ontario and Alberta were among those in the crowd.
He said he was there to hear from them about their concerns, and many said they were there to hear Charest’s ideas.
Calgary MP Greg McLean said while some might knock Charest’s progressive credentials, it’s not a bad thing.
“It is something he brings to the table that is laudable,” McLean said on his way into the event.
“A lot of people in Alberta still believe we need a Progressive Conservative type of government.”
So far, there is only one officially declared candidate in the race, career MP Pierre Poilievre.
He has amassed considerable support from caucus already — some on his side held their own private event on Thursday at the same time.
Others took to social media, circulating a graphic that equaled him to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, for his support of carbon taxes and the now-defunct long-gun registry.
He was in favour of both while serving as premier of Quebec, where he also raised provincial sales tax.
“I’m with grassroots Conservative Party members, Alberta MP Shannon Stubbs wrote.
“Our leader must share our values, and respect our policies. I’m against the carbon tax, the long-gun registry, and for tax cuts, not tax hikes.”

House votes in favour of Emergencies Act oversight committee

Full text: The House of Commons has approved the creation of a special committee to review the powers exercised by the Trudeau government under the Emergencies Act, but the bickering over its structure has cast doubt on its effectiveness.
The House voted 214-115 Wednesday evening in favour of a government proposal that will see three Liberal MPs, two Conservatives, one New Democrat and one Bloc Québécois sit on the committee, along with four senators.
Conservatives opposed the proposal, with the NDP and Bloc voting in favour. A similar motion must now be dealt with in the Senate before the committee can get up and running, with its report expected later this month.
The federal government used the Emergencies Act for the first time on Feb. 14 to deal with the so-called “Freedom Convoy” occupation in Ottawa and blockades at border crossings. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau revoked the declaration of emergency last week.
The act requires that a joint House-Senate committee review the powers and duties exercised while the declaration of emergency was in effect. Experts worry that the acrimony between the Liberals and Conservatives over what the committee should look like will taint its ultimate findings.
“There isn’t even an agreement on the structure of the parliamentary oversight committee, let alone what sort of report would come out of it,” said Perrin Beatty, who introduced the Emergencies Act in 1987 while serving as defence minister in Brian Mulroney’s Progressive Conservative government.
“That’s unfortunate. It disserves the country.”
The fighting has not inspired confidence in the committee’s ability to do its work, said national security expert Wesley Wark. He said this work should include getting a picture of what the federal government understood to be the threat requiring use of the act, and the delayed responses by government to the protests.
“Parliament is deeply divided in its response to the use of the Emergencies Act,” he said, “and it is very difficult to see how that partisanship is going to be set aside once the committee gets going.”
What exactly the committee will be studying and who it will be hearing from remains to be seen, with some of those parameters only becoming clearer once the committee begins its work.
The act states that committee members will take an oath of secrecy and review in private any order or regulation issued in secret while the declaration of emergency was in effect.
But the Privy Council Office confirmed that no such orders or regulations were made, and it’s expected some if not most of the committee’s work will be done in public.
The government’s proposal will see the committee get three co-chairs: the NDP and Bloc MPs and one senator. The government argued that neither the Liberals nor the Conservatives should co-chair, given that the former invoked the Emergencies Act and the latter expressed support for the protests that led to its invocation.
“It’s essential that as we move forward and look at this chapter of history, that the parliamentary review be done and that the committee be both balanced and impartial in its deliberations,” said Government House Leader Mark Holland during debate in the House on Monday.
“And I think what we have put forward demonstrates exactly those principles, and it’s time we get to work on that committee.”
The Tories rejected the proposal, arguing that traditionally, oversight committees are chaired by a member of the Official Opposition. They said that a Conservative senator should co-chair the committee with a Liberal MP, putting forward an amendment to that effect that failed in the House on Wednesday.
“It should stand to reason that there should be a member of Her Majesty’s Official Opposition as a chair of that committee because it is designed to provide extraordinary oversight,” Conservative House Leader John Brassard said Monday.
The Conservatives also accused the government of giving itself a “working majority” on the committee, given that the NDP voted with the Liberals to confirm the declaration of emergency .
The act requires the committee to deliver its report within seven sitting days after the declaration is revoked, which was last Wednesday. The House and Senate are off for two weeks after Friday, making March 22 the committee’s likely deadline.
The government’s motion says the parties in the House must identify their respective committee members by Thursday, and the Senate must also vote on a similar motion that would allow a member from each of the four Senate groups to sit on the committee.
A statement from the office of government representative Sen. Marc Gold said earlier this week that should the motion pass in the House, “the Senate will be called upon to do the same with expediency.”
Given the bickering over the committee, Sen. Scott Tannas, leader of the Canadian Senators Group (CSG), proposed on Wednesday that the upper chamber also strike its own, Senate-only committee to review the government’s use of the Emergencies Act and deliver an interim report no later than June 15.
A debate on Tannas’s proposal will happen at a later date.
“The CSG is concerned about the proposed process for reviewing the government’s decision to invoke the Emergencies Act,” Tannas said in a statement Wednesday. “We are confident that such a politically charged subject would benefit from a substantive investigation, freer from partisan considerations.”
As required by the act, the government also has to call an inquiry into the circumstances that led to the declaration of emergency, within 60 days of the declaration being revoked. The inquiry’s report must then be tabled in a year.

Full text: Forget scrapping licence plate fees and losing $1.1 billion a year from the provincial treasury — that money should be spent on mental health, says the Green Party of Ontario.
In an election campaign platform that specifically addresses pandemic anxiety, the Greens are promising to cut wait times for children’s services, create a three-digit hotline for mental distress and even boost stress-busting help through more trails and parks.
The cost, at $6.6 billion over four years, would be largely funded by reinstating licence plate sticker fees — which Premier Doug Ford recently did away with — Green Leader Mike Schreiner told the Star in an exclusive interview in advance of Thursday’s platform release.
“I guess the bottom line for me is, everything is not OK when it comes to mental health,” Schreiner said.
“People were experiencing significant wait times and lack of access to services pre-pandemic, but things have gotten much worse over the past two years during the pandemic,” he said, with about half of Ontarians saying their mental health has worsened during the pandemic and many not being able to find the help they need.
Schreiner believes his party is the first to put out a stand-alone platform on mental health and addictions, which will form a large part of its campaign promises for the upcoming June 2 election.
Prior to the pandemic, Children’s Mental Health Ontario had reported 28,000 children on wait lists of up to 2.5 years for mental health services, and Schreiner said even accessing a therapist can take more than 67 days, and up to 92 days for more intensive treatments.
“If you went to an emergency room with a broken arm, and were told ‘Yes, we can fix that but it’s going to take 92 days,’ that would just be completely unacceptable and ridiculous,” he said. “So why is that the case with mental health services, especially when so many people are saying mental health is health?”
During the last election campaign, the Progressive Conservatives pledged $3.8 billion over 10 years for mental health. The Ford government has spent additional millions for mental health supports in education, much of it pandemic-related, and has an associate minister of mental health and addictions, Michael Tibollo, who Schreiner said has been listening to the needs of Ontarians.
Schreiner said a Green government would make mental health spending about 10 per cent of the provincial budget, with an immediate eight per cent increase for community health services.
“This is the real implications of taking $1.1 billion out of the provincial budget,” he said of the end of licence plate sticker fees. “That’s $6.6 billion over four years for mental health and addictions — $4.4 billion of that coming from the lost revenue from licence stickers. The rest is from the federal government fulfilling promises they made in the budget and their election platform.”
He said there’s a clear tie-in to communities and the environment, and that increasing access to “nature, parks, trails, green space — making investments in protecting green space, but also expanding things we have like parks, and trail networks, and community centres, youth wellness hubs” are proactive measures that will help people and, down the line, save money.
The Green plan for mental health and addictions would expand care under OHIP, as well as create a three-digit “crisis response” phone line” with specially trained staff, while also providing more training to Telehealth Ontario’s staff.
It also promises to reduce wait lists for children to 30 days or less, while also providing more help to Indigenous-led clinics and healing programs and would also declare the opiod crisis a public health emergency to free up more funds.
The Green party also supports decriminalizing drug use and creating more safe consumption sites.
“Our vision is to transform mental health care in Ontario to ensure people requiring care receive the services they need when and where they need them from a system that is affordable, accessible, comprehensive, and easy to navigate,” the Green platform says.
“Ontario Greens know that if we are hampered by high costs and inaccessible mental health care services, people and communities pay the price. The pandemic and the challenges of a changing climate are putting a strain on our mental health.”

Full text: Longtime Quebec politician Jean Charest was greeted with hugs and applause late Wednesday in what was his first public foray into the leadership race for the federal Conservative party.
The stakes are high for the former federal Progressive Conservative leader, already being slammed as a Liberal by other federal Tories.
But Charest was jovial when asked on his way into the small reception - held in the aptly-named Quebec room of the famous Chateau Laurier hotel - whether he was going to run.
"Where to?" he joked.
In earnest, Charest said he was waiting for the rules of the race itself to be revealed before making a decision.
The party released a few details late Wednesday: The new leader will be selected by Sept. 10, and candidates will have until June 3 to sign up new members.
That deadline is key, sources close to Charest had said earlier, as it will help them decide whether they can sign up enough people in time to be able to win.
Charest said there is one thing he knows already.
"One thing that I believe to be very important is to have a national Conservative party that is able to represent every part of Canada," he said.
"It's really our responsibility to be that national political party."
Charest said the rules will tell him whether a campaign is viable - will he have enough time to sign up members is a key point, his team told the Star.
Charest's campaign already has the support of a number of Quebec MPs, but lawmakers from Nova Scotia, Ontario and Alberta were among those in the crowd.
He said he was there to hear from them about their concerns, and many said they were there to hear Charest's ideas.
Calgary MP Greg McLean said while some might knock Charest's progressive credentials, it's not a bad thing.
"It is something he brings to the table that is laudable," McLean said.

Full text: Hours after the United Nations sided with Ukraine and demanded Russia withdraw from its territory, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed the vote and appealed to Canada for more sanctions and "restrictive measures" to halt the bombardment of his country.
Zelenskyy, who is hunkered in Kyiv as Russian troops advance on the capital, took to Twitter to praise the UN's backing and then to say he had talked to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and "thanked him for the leadership in imposing anti-Russian sanctions."
He said he also "stressed the need to expand restrictive measures. The bombing of civilians in Ukraine must be stopped immediately," said Zelenskyy.
Zelenskyy has pleaded in vain with European leaders to create a no-fly zone over his country - a move NATO countries including Canada have rejected as one that would escalate to an all-out war with nuclear-armed Russia.
But the embattled Ukrainian leader welcomed the powerful show of support from the UN General Assembly, which voted 141-5 to condemn Russia's invasion and demanded Russia "immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders."
Zelenskyy called it "unprecedented" and "a strong demand to Russia to immediately stop the treacherous attack." He said he was grateful to "everyone and every state that voted in favour. You have chosen the right side of history."
The Ukrainian president tweeted about his evening phone call with Trudeau - which took place around 10:30 p.m. Kyiv time.
Later, a senior Canadian government official said Zelenskyy pressed for more sanctions and more rapid implementation of those already announced, including the ban on major Russian banks dealing with the SWIFT international transaction system.
The SWIFT system is based in Brussels, and some European countries are still reluctant to include certain Russian banks that process their payments for Russian energy supplies.
To date, Canada has levied punitive sanctions alongside other G7 and NATO allies against Russian President Vladimir Putin, several of his top political lieutenants, including his foreign, finance, defence and justice ministers, Russian lawmakers in the Russian Duma or parliament, along with dozens of Russian oligarchs and their family members who are close to Putin's inner circle, some of whom hold his personal wealth.
Canada has also sent $19 million in lethal arms, including anti-tank weapons, and about $37 million in non-lethal gear, night vision gear, helmets, and body armour. The federal government has also provided more than $150 million in humanitarian assistance since the invasion began, and has fast-tracked study and work permits of Ukrainian nationals already in the pipeline or those who are here and looking to extend their stay.
Conservatives and New Democrats in Canada are pressing Trudeau for more sanctions directly on other Russian oligarchs who hold assets in Canada.
Conservative MP James Bezan used Commons parliamentary privilege, as British MPs have done, to name two individuals without fear of being sued, saying "Canada has yet to sanction some of his closest friends and advisers."
"Russian oligarch and politician Konstantin Babkin, director of Buhler Industries in Manitoba, said in 2014 that Russia should not stop at Crimea, and, last month, supported Russia's current actions. Putin insider Roman Abramovich, owner of Evraz, which has operations in Western Canada, is supplying steel to build Russian tanks," Bezan said. "When will the prime minister finally sanction Russian oligarchs for supporting Putin's war machine?"
Trudeau replied that Canada is moving in "alignment" with western allies, adding, "We continue to look for more people to sanction. We continue to look for next steps. We will make more steps, but we will do it in a co-ordinated fashion with all allies together, because that is what makes the biggest impact."
Canada's sanctions included the unprecedented move to oust major Russian banks and financial institutions from the SWIFT international transactions system which has jammed many banks - and Russians - from conducting business internationally, as well as a ban on the ability of the Russian central bank to access and use its foreign-denominated reserves to shore up its sagging currency, the ruble.
The Conservatives demand Ottawa evict Russia's ambassador, Oleg Stepanov, and other embassy personnel. All three opposition parties want to allow Ukrainians fleeing the war to have visa-free access to Canada, if they can make it this far.

NDP proposes bill to regulate pump prices: Legislation would give Ontario Energy Board power over mark-ups on petroleum products

Full text: Gas prices in Ontario are soaring - sitting at $1.60 or higher and set to keep rising - and the Opposition New Democrats are urging regulation of the cost of petroleum, a move the energy minister said wouldn't save drivers money.
The NDP introduced a private member's bill Wednesday on gas price regulation that they have tried to get passed on two previous occasions, saying it would prevent "gouging" at the pumps.
"We have other provinces in this country, other states in the U.S., that are regulating gas prices to make sure that they don't gouge you when a long weekend is coming, and that when you're travelling through, for example, northern Ontario or even through parts of the GTA, you're not seeing a huge discrepancy between gasoline prices," said NDP Leader Andrea Horwath.
"What the bill indicates is that you can't just increase it willy nilly before a long weekend ... So the price would be set, for example, on a Monday, and it would stay in place until the following Monday so that there's certainty about what the gas price is going to be."
The bill from New Democrat Gilles Bisson would give the Ontario Energy Board power to regulate the retail price and wholesale mark-up on petroleum products.
Energy Minister Todd Smith said the OEB has studies showing that regulation wouldn't actually lower gas prices. Instead, he said, gas prices should be lowered by the federal government cancelling a planned increase to the carbon tax.
"If we drop the price of a litre of gas in Ontario, there's nothing to say that the federal government or the gas companies (won't) fill that void," Smith said.
The Ontario government is giving drivers a break by eliminating the $120-a-year fee for licence plate renewal, he said.
But the government doesn't appear to be cutting the provincial fuel tax by 5.7 cents, as promised by Premier Doug Ford as recently as November.
The Progressive Conservatives promised in the 2018 election to cut gas prices by 10 cents. Ending the previous Liberal government's cap-and-trade system was to lower prices by 4.3 cents and the rest would come from lowering the provincial fuel tax.
They did end cap-and-trade, but that meant the federal carbon tax backstop kicked in, negating savings at the pump. Ford's government tried fighting it in court, but lost.
The provincial fuel tax rate remains unchanged from 2018, and the government is now saying it will follow through with that 5.7-cent cut if the federal government matches it.
"The (federal) government should also not go ahead with the planned increase to the carbon tax on April 1 this year, which will add another 2.2 cents a litre," Smith said.
"It doesn't sound like a lot, but that's 11 cents a litre in federal carbon tax. That's not only affecting you at the pumps, but it's affecting the price of the groceries that you buy and everything else that you consume."
Federal Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault told The Canadian Press in an interview that there is no discussion about delaying an increase to the carbon price in April.
"And in fact he knows better, that we're sending the revenues back to households in Ontario of carbon pricing. So this idea that somehow Ontarians are worse off because of carbon pricing is not true."
The high demand for oil combined with a shortage of supply has been pushing oil prices, and consequently, gas prices up for weeks. There is also still much uncertainty around how Russia's invasion of Ukraine will lead to a loss of oil supply.
In response, Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne told reporters on Parliament Hill on Wednesday that he has asked the Competition Bureau to keep an eye on prices at the pumps and has spoken to companies about boosting domestic production to counteract any possible shortages.

Cities need a new deal

Full text: Canada has an urban crisis.
With that stark warning on Jan. 12, 2002, the Toronto Star launched a sweeping "New Deal for Cities" campaign. Citing the ongoing crises for affordable housing and funding for transit and social welfare systems, the paper urged Canadian cities be given new powers and new respect.
Today, some 20 years later, our cities are still in crisis - their finances in dire straits and their powers weak and ineffective.
Indeed, it's time for another "New Deal for Cities" campaign, one driven by forward-looking politicians, corporate executives and community leaders. That's because for the most part the mayors of our large cities - Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Ottawa, Halifax and others - remain "beggars and whiners" when it comes to dealing with senior governments.
Worse, none of the current leaders of our major federal and provincial parties are talking these days about a renewed or revitalized "urban agenda."
Now is the ideal time to launch a new cities' campaign given that critical elections will be held in our three largest provinces in the coming months. Provincial legislatures hold huge sway over cities, with make-or-break powers that can affect almost every facet of life for urban residents.
A good example of provincial power came in 2018 when newly elected Ontario Premier Doug Ford slashed the size of Toronto City Council in half - in the midst of an election campaign. He did it as an act of revenge against Mayor John Tory and city councillors - but no one, not even the courts, could stop him.
Back in 2002, the Star kicked off its campaign with a front-page editorial written by then-publisher John Honderich, who died less than a month ago.
"As we begin a new century, we have a stark choice: either manage our cities' future and aspire to greatness, or manage their gradual decline," Honderich wrote. "We opt for greatness."
Honderich argued that any new deal must involve fundamental changes in government structure and finances. He stressed that no longer should large cities be deemed mere "creatures of the provinces," but rather distinct power centres with legitimate needs requiring attention.
The campaign never stopped. Day after day for several years the Star drummed the phrase "New Deal" into the public consciousness. Politicians in Ottawa and provincial capitals slowly started to pay attention. Community movers and shakers came on board, as did the heads of local boards of trade and chambers of commerce.
Gradually, cities from Halifax to Vancouver were granted some new powers, allowing them to think big at times. In Ontario, the province signed into law in 2006 the City of Toronto Act, which allowed the city to impose new taxes, such as the land-transfer tax, and to pass bylaws on local boards.
But the act didn't give Toronto the power to impose income and sales taxes, two measures considered vital in helping to stem the rot.
Sadly, our cities continue to fray. Streets are filled with potholes. Buses and subways are frequently "delayed." Public housing is plagued by years-long waiting lists and crumbling buildings. Park lawns are mowed less often and snow clearance is slow.
Ontario holds its provincial election on June 2. The Quebec election is on Oct. 3 and the Alberta vote will be held early next year.
In each of these coming elections, the future of our cities is an issue that can galvanize urban support. That's particularly true in Ontario where Liberal leader Steven Del Duca and NDP leader Andrea Horwath are searching for a powerful issue that clearly defines their party's campaign.
Back in 2002, Honderich asked in the front-page editorial: "Who stands up for Toronto? Where are the voices? Where are those elected to represent us?"
Those words are as true today as they were 20 years ago: Where are they?

Full text: A maverick Toronto MPP ejected from Premier Doug Ford's caucus for questioning pandemic lockdowns is considering a bid for the federal Conservative leadership.
Roman Baber, the Independent York Centre MPP kicked out of the provincial Progressive Conservatives last year, said Wednesday he has "been receiving some calls encouraging me to run."
"I've also made some phone calls trying to determine the level of support and a lot of folks have been supportive," he told the Star.
Baber gained a national profile in January 2021 after Ford defenestrated him over a two-page open letter that maintained COVID-19 lockdowns, despite evidence of their public health benefits and widespread public support, were ineffective and caused more mental-health harm than public-health good.
"The medicine is killing the patient," the lawyer wrote at the time, noting the rise in suicides and opioid overdoses, among other apparent lockdown side effects.
Ford insisted that was an "irresponsible" stance, undermining the government's pandemic plan.
Baber - who is vaccinated but believes vaccines should be voluntary and is pushing "jobs and jabs" legislation Thursday to reinstate workers fired for not having their shots - said he has been heartened by the response from federal Tories.
"I think the party is looking for principled leadership and is looking for someone who stands up for what they believe in," he said, adding he backed centrist Peter MacKay in the 2021 CPC contest won by Erin O'Toole, who was dumped by the federal caucus last month.
"Like most Canadians, I'm right-of-centre fiscally and slightly left-of-centre socially," said the first-term MPP, whose family fled the former Soviet Union for Israel when he was nine years old. He arrived in Canada at 15.
"I'm Exhibit A for Canadian opportunity. I was lucky enough to get elected to represent the very same electoral district that welcomed me as an immigrant (26 years ago)."
Baber, who also opposed as "ineffective" the mandatory vaccine passport phased out in Ontario on Tuesday, said he would study the forthcoming federal Tory contest rules before making a final decision soon.
The rules - including the entry fee, deadline date to sign up new members and the date of the vote - are expected to be released as early as this Friday after the party's national council has signed off.

Full text: With the June 2 Ontario election less than 100 days away, Premier Doug Ford was out again this week wooing working-class voters.
His recent transformation in this regard raises something of a dilemma. Is a political leader to be cheered or disdained if he’s doing praiseworthy things primarily for reasons of self-interest?
On the face of it, who could gainsay the Ford government’s proposed legislation to set a minimum wage of $15 an hour for workers in the so-called gig economy, to establish clarity of hours, protect against arbitrary dismissal, and safeguard tips?
As the Star’s Sara Mojtehedzadeh has diligently reported , workers in the growing gig sector have been sorely treated and inadequately compensated for their labours.
Working for app companies, deemed independent contractors rather than employees, such workers have lacked job security, benefits, and in many cases even reliable work schedules.
While the law introduced by Ford’s labour minister, Monte McNaughton would not address the employment status of gig workers, and applies only to hours spent “actively” driving customers or products, it does aim to establish a set of foundational rights, Mojtehedzadeh reported.
Still, the Ford government’s apparent conversion leaves labour economists, among others, more than a little suspicious.
In 2018, the government rolled back planned minimum-wage increases, eliminated paid sick days and equal pay for equal work.
That was then. Now, Ford has appointed himself champion of working men and women.
On Monday, he reviewed some of the pocketbook measures he has recently announced. He’s cutting the $120 licence sticker fee. He’s cutting tolls on Highways 412 and 418. Earlier, to the applause of union leaders, he raised the minimum wage to $15.
“Our government listens to workers,” he crowed. “We aren’t leaving any workers behind, absolutely no one.”
All of this prompted one reporter to ask this week if Ford had somehow found his inner liberal.
Well, the premier replied, “my kids call me a bleeding heart.”
Perhaps. But on an initiative so driven by timing, the premier’s may have been less than ideal.
David Doorey, an industrial relations professor at York University, said a decision issued by a labour ministry employment standards officer just days before Ford’s announcement may have actually blown it out of the water.
The decision, which found Uber Eats had violated the Employment Standards Act, deemed a Toronto Uber Eats driver an “employee” for the purposes of the act and said its protections apply.
Moreover, the decision said that “deemed working hours include time spent waiting or holding oneself ready to work.”
If that’s the case, Doorey argued, the proposed Ontario law would actually reduce protections for gig workers, not improve them.
Uber has said it plans to appeal the decision to the Ontario Labour Relations Board.
Ford, of course, is playing to a different market and timeline as his government nears election day.
As a political tactic, it is an understandable move.
The strategy goes back 40 years or so to the suburban fringe around Detroit, when the phenomenon of “Reagan Democrats” was first identified in Michigan’s Macomb County.
Blue-collar workers were — in large part for social and cultural reasons — voting Republican, feeling the Democrats they had traditionally supported had abandoned them.
That trend has continued in various ways across North America. And the premier is offering them a home in his Progressive Conservative party.
Even if he likely wouldn’t have known Woody Guthrie from Sam Walton.

Full text: Canada has an urban crisis.
With that stark warning on Jan. 12, 2002, the Toronto Star launched a sweeping “New Deal for Cities” campaign. Citing the ongoing crises for affordable housing and funding for transit and social welfare systems, the paper urged Canadian cities be given new powers and new respect.
Today, some 20 years later, our cities are still in crisis — their finances in dire straits and their powers weak and ineffective.
Indeed, it’s time for another “New Deal for Cities” campaign, one driven by forward-looking politicians, corporate executives and community leaders.
That’s because for the most part the mayors of our large cities — Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Ottawa, Halifax and others — remain “beggars and whiners” when it comes to dealing with senior governments.
Worse, none of the current leaders of our major federal and provincial parties are talking these days about a renewed or revitalized “urban agenda.”
Now is the ideal time to launch a new cities’ campaign given that critical elections will be held in our three largest provinces in the coming months. Provincial legislatures hold huge sway over cities, with make-or-break powers that can affect almost every facet of life for urban residents.
A good example of provincial power came in 2018 when newly elected Ontario Premier Doug Ford slashed the size of Toronto City Council in half — in the midst of an election campaign. He did it as an act of revenge against Mayor John Tory and city councillors — but no one, not even the courts, could stop him.
Back in 2002, the Star kicked off its campaign with a front-page editorial written by then-publisher John Honderich, who died less than a month ago.
“As we begin a new century, we have a stark choice: either manage our cities’ future and aspire to greatness, or manage their gradual decline,” Honderich wrote. “We opt for greatness.”
Honderich argued that any new deal must involve fundamental changes in government structure and finances. He stressed that no longer should large cities be deemed mere “creatures of the provinces,” but rather distinct power centres with legitimate needs requiring attention.
The campaign never stopped. Day after day for several years the Star drummed the phrase “New Deal” into the public consciousness. Politicians in Ottawa and provincial capitals slowly started to pay attention. Community movers and shakers came on board, as did the heads of local boards of trade and chambers of commerce.
Gradually, cities from Halifax to Vancouver were granted some new powers, allowing them to think big at times. In Ontario, the province signed into law in 2006 the City of Toronto Act, which allowed the city to impose new taxes, such as the land-transfer tax, and to pass bylaws on local boards.
But the act didn’t give Toronto the power to impose income and sales taxes, two measures considered vital in helping to stem the rot.
Sadly, our cities continue to fray. Streets are filled with potholes. Buses and subways are frequently “delayed.” Public housing is plagued by years-long waiting lists and crumbling buildings. Park lawns are mowed less often and snow clearance is slow.
Ontario holds its provincial election on June 2. The Quebec election is on Oct. 3 and the Alberta vote will be held early next year.
In each of these coming elections, the future of our cities is an issue that can galvanize urban support. That’s particularly true in Ontario where Liberal leader Steven Del Duca and NDP leader Andrea Horwath are searching for a powerful issue that clearly defines their party’s campaign.
Back in 2002, Honderich asked in the front-page editorial: “Who stands up for Toronto? Where are the voices? Where are those elected to represent us?”
Those words are as true today as they were 20 years ago: Where are they?

Althia Raj: Pierre Poilievre offers right-wing populism to the Conservatives. Will they take him up on it?

Full text: Canada’s Conservative party is changing. The question is whether it goes down a right-wing populist path — as Republicans south of the border have with Donald Trump — or whether it takes a centrist approach to appeal to a wider audience. In many ways, that question reveals the cracks in the nearly 20-year-old marriage of convenience between the Progressive Conservatives and the Canadian Alliance, one that risks ending up in a nasty divorce.
The only declared candidate, Carleton MP Pierre Poilievre, is a polarizing figure with a “take no prisoners” attitude. He recently called Europe’s response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shockingly “ weak ,” embraced the so-called “Freedom Convoy,” and called COVID-19 public health measures a purposeful attempt by governments “ to try and take away our freedom and give themselves more power .”
In the past, Poilievre has attacked the media, made derogatory comments about Indigenous peoples , left the door open to a niqab ban in the public service , and broken the election law . Elected at age 25, the career MP is a forceful opposition critic who has railed against elites , placed the blame for rising inflation and house prices at the feet of the Liberals, and promised more energy projects. His campaign launch through a social media video on Feb. 5 garnered more than seven million views on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. At least 26 Conservative caucus members have endorsed him.
Those who haven’t hope for a more mature candidate with a unifying message.
That’s what former Quebec premier Jean Charest, Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown and political commentator Tasha Kheiriddin want to offer. All three are current outsiders, and all hail from the Progressive Conservative side of the party.
Charest started his political career in 1984 under prime minister Brian Mulroney. He will meet with Conservative MPs — most of whom know little about him — on Wednesday in Ottawa. On Monday, Quebec’s anti-corruption unit (UPAC) ended its eight-year probe into allegations the Quebec Liberal party engaged in illegal financing when Charest was at the helm. It’s a welcome gift that clears the way for his candidacy.
Not that it will be a walk in the park. Jenni Byrne, Poilievre’s strategist, laid out the attacks against Charest on Twitter , describing him as a “Liberal who campaigned against [prime minister] Stephen Harper,” “ supported the long-gun registry , raised taxes, brought in a carbon tax & worked for Huawei while the Chinese Govt detained kidnapped Canadians.” Her offensive led to an ugly public dispute on Sunday with Charest organizer and Tory MP Alain Rayes .
Brown, a vocal opponent of Quebec’s Bill 21, was a Conservative MP from 2006 until 2015, when he became leader of the Ontario PCs. Before resigning over allegations of sexual misconduct, which he strenuously denies, he sought to expand the Ontario party’s tent by supporting carbon pricing and reaching out to ethnic communities.
Kheiriddin has never held elected office, but she is well known, bilingual, and has no baggage.
Their decisions about whether to enter the leadership contest depend on the rules of the game — which could be announced as early as Wednesday. Poilievre’s camp wants a June vote and a membership cut-off of mid-May, sources said, giving any opponents little time to organize. His challengers would benefit from a longer race, with more time to sell memberships to newcomers and more time to be heard by existing members.
Charest and Brown will likely need to change the current makeup of the party — around 200,000 members — if they are to succeed. The Tories pick leaders through a weighted ranked ballot, in which every riding with more than 100 members is worth 100 points. Unless Poilievre were to win a majority on the first round, a race that includes Charest, Brown and Kheiriddin could see any of them benefit from each other’s supporters.
Poilievre is already courting down-ballot support from social conservative favourite Leslyn Lewis, the Conservative MP for Haldimand—Norfolk. Independent York Centre MPP Roman Baber , a staunch opponent of COVID-19 restrictions, is also contemplating a run.
Back in 2017, Andrew Scheer was elected leader as the compromise candidate, supported by social conservatives, Quebec dairy farmers and members who didn’t trust Maxime Bernier. In 2020, Erin O’Toole was also the compromise candidate, acceptable to social conservatives, and less centrist than Peter MacKay. In 2022, Poilievre is modelling himself as that candidate. But it’s unclear that the parts of the party he’s already alienated — namely the Quebec branch and those uncomfortable with his courtship of People’s Party supporters — will be willing to unite behind him once this race is over.
In choosing a leader, the Conservatives must ask themselves what their winning formula will be —do they want to take votes from Bernier’s far-right party or from Justin Trudeau’s Liberals?

Ukraine's president asks Canada for more anti-Russian sanctions and 'restrictive' measures

Full text: OTTAWA—Hours after the United Nations sided with Ukraine and demanded Russia withdraw from its territory, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed the vote and appealed to Canada for more sanctions and “restrictive measures” to halt the bombardment of his country.
Zelenskyy, who is hunkered in Kyiv as Russian troops advance on the capital, took to Twitter to praise the UN’s backing and then to say he had talked to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and “thanked him for the leadership in imposing anti-Russian sanctions.”
He said he also “stressed the need to expand restrictive measures. The bombing of civilians in Ukraine must be stopped immediately,” said Zelenskyy.
Zelenskyy has pleaded in vain with European leaders to create a no-fly zone over his country — a move NATO countries including Canada have rejected as one that would escalate to an all-out war with nuclear-armed Russia.
But the embattled Ukrainian leader welcomed the powerful show of support from the UN General Assembly which voted 141-5 to condemn Russia’s invasion and demanded Russia “immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.”
Zelenskyy called it “unprecedented” and “a strong demand to Russia to immediately stop the treacherous attack.” He said he was grateful to “everyone and every state that voted in favour. You have chosen the right side of history.”
The Ukrainian president tweeted about his evening phone call with Trudeau — which took place around 10:30 p.m. Kyiv time.
Later a senior Canadian government official said Zelenskyy pressed for more sanctions and more rapid implementation of those already announced, including the ban on major Russian banks dealing with the SWIFT international transaction system.
The SWIFT system is based in Brussels, and some European countries are still reluctant to include certain Russian banks that process their payments for Russian energy supplies.
To date, Canada has levied punitive sanctions alongside other G7 and NATO allies against Russian President Vladimir Putin, several of his top political lieutenants, including his foreign, finance, defence and justice ministers, Russian lawmakers in the Russian Duma or parliament, along with dozens of Russian oligarchs and their family members who are close to Putin’s inner circle, some of whom hold his personal wealth.
Canada has also sent $19 million in lethal arms including anti-tank weapons, and about $37 million in non-lethal gear night vision gear, helmets, and body armour; more than $150 million in humanitarian assistance since the invasion began, and has fast-tracked study and work permits of Ukrainian nationals already in the pipeline or those who are here and looking to extend their stay.
Conservatives and New Democrats in Canada are pressing Trudeau for more sanctions directly on other Russian oligarchs who hold assets in Canada.
Conservative MP James Bezan used Commons parliamentary privilege, as British MPs have done, to name two individuals without fear of being sued, saying “Canada has yet to sanction some of his closest friends and advisers.”
“Russian oligarch and politician Konstantin Babkin, director of Buhler Industries in Manitoba, said in 2014 that Russia should not stop at Crimea, and, last month, supported Russia’s current actions. Putin insider Roman Abramovich, owner of Evraz, which has operations in Western Canada, is supplying steel to build Russian tanks,” Bezan said. “When will the prime minister finally sanction Russian oligarchs for supporting Putin’s war machine?”
Trudeau replied that Canada is moving in “alignment” with Western allies, adding, “We continue to look for more people to sanction. We continue to look for next steps. We will make more steps, but we will do it in a co-ordinated fashion with all allies together, because that is what makes the biggest impact.”
Canada’s sanctions included the unprecedented move to oust several major Russian banks and financial institutions from the international transactions system known as SWIFT which has jammed many banks — and Russians — from transacting business internationally, as well as a ban on the ability of the Russian Central Bank to access and use its foreign-denominated reserves to shore up its sagging currency, the ruble.
The Conservatives demand Ottawa evict Russia’s ambassador Oleg Stepanov and other embassy personnel. All three opposition parties want to allow Ukrainians fleeing the war to have visa-free access to Canada, if they can make it this far.
Trudeau told the Commons Wednesday his government continues to look at “all different ways that we can make positive impacts in the lives of Ukrainians, and in ending this.”
The federal government sent conflicting signals Wednesday about whether it would compensate Canadian companies or industries hurt by sanctions imposed on Russians or Russian companies.
Earlier in the day, Trudeau said sanctions “obviously have a cost at home. That’s how international trade works,” echoing a warning a day earlier by Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland.
Freeland had said Canadians should be prepared for that impact as the cost of fighting for democracy and a global rules-based order.
But Trudeau suggested in French that because punitive sanctions are necessary to persuade Putin to reverse his decision to invade Ukraine, the government could try to offset the pain that might be felt here in Canada.
“Yes, there will be industries and people who are going to be affected. We are going to see what we can do to compensate, but we also know that we have friends, partners, allies in Europe who are going to suffer a lot more, and our concern is to be there for each other,” Trudeau said on his way into a national caucus meeting.
Requests for clarification to Trudeau’s and Freeland’s offices were not immediately answered, and an afternoon news conference was abruptly cancelled, rescheduled for Thursday.
However, Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne downplayed the need for compensation and the extent of Canada’s trade with Russia, saying it represents less than one per cent of Canadian imports and exports.
“Of course, we expect a certain impact on the price of gas” at the pump, Champagne said, because it is tied to global prices “which can fluctuate.”
There will also probably be impacts on wheat and food commodity prices, he said, adding that he has already flagged to the Competition Bureau that price changes in Canada should be based on global market changes.
Overall, Champagne said, the impact for Canada “will probably be very moderate.”

Full text: A maverick Toronto MPP ejected from Premier Doug Ford’s caucus for questioning pandemic lockdowns is considering a bid for the federal Conservative leadership.
Roman Baber, the Independent York Centre MPP kicked out of the provincial Progressive Conservatives last year, said Wednesday he has “been receiving some calls encouraging me to run.”
“I’ve also made some phone calls trying to determine the level of support and a lot of folks have been supportive,” he told the Star.
Baber gained a national profile in January 2021 after Ford defenestrated him over a two-page open letter that maintained COVID-19 lockdowns, despite evidence of their public health benefits and widespread public support, were ineffective and caused more mental-health harm than public-health good.
“The medicine is killing the patient,” the lawyer wrote at the time, noting the rise in suicides and opioid overdoses, among other apparent lockdown side effects.
Ford insisted that was an “irresponsible” stance, undermining the government’s pandemic plan.
Baber — who is vaccinated but believes vaccines should be voluntary and is pushing “jobs and jabs” legislation Thursday to reinstate workers fired for not having their shots — said he has been heartened by the response from federal Tories.
“I think the party is looking for principled leadership and is looking for someone who stands up for what they believe in,” he said, adding he backed centrist Peter MacKay in the 2021 CPC contest won by Erin O’Toole, who was dumped by the federal caucus last month.
“Like most Canadians, I’m right-of-centre fiscally and slightly left-of-centre socially,” said the first-term MPP, whose family fled the former Soviet Union for Israel when he was nine years old. He arrived in Canada at 15.
“I’m Exhibit A for Canadian opportunity. I was lucky enough to get elected to represent the very same electoral district that welcomed me as an immigrant (26 years ago).”
Baber, who also opposed as “ineffective” the mandatory vaccine passport phased out in Ontario on Tuesday, said he would study the forthcoming federal Tory contest rules before making a final decision soon.
The rules — including the entry fee, deadline date to sign up new members and the date of the vote — are expected to be released as early as this Friday after the party’s national council has signed off.
So far, the only declared candidate is Carleton MP Pierre Poilievre , a career politician with significant caucus support. He’s already holding rallies — including one this week in Saskatchewan. His supporters are pushing hard for a swift contest, with a vote as early as June so a new leader would have the summer to get organized.
But some prominent Tories are kicking the tires on a bid, including former Quebec premier Jean Charest, who used to lead the old federal Progressive Conservatives. Charest is hosting a meet-and-greet with MPs in Ottawa late Thursday. His campaign is supported by a number of Quebec Conservatives, including the party’s former Quebec lieutenant Alain Rayes.
Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown, a one-time Ontario PC leader, and conservative strategist Tasha Kheiriddin are also making calls, as is rookie MP Leslyn Lewis, who placed third in the 2020 leadership contest.

Full text: With the June 2 Ontario election less than 100 days away, Premier Doug Ford was out again this week wooing working-class voters.
His recent transformation in this regard raises something of a dilemma. Is a political leader to be cheered or disdained if he's doing praiseworthy things primarily for reasons of self-interest?
On the face of it, who could gainsay the Ford government's proposed legislation to set a minimum wage of $15 an hour for workers in the so-called gig economy, to establish clarity of hours, protect against arbitrary dismissal, and safeguard tips?
As the Star's Sara Mojtehedzadeh has diligently reported, workers in the growing gig sector have been sorely treated and inadequately compensated for their labours.
Working for app companies, deemed independent contractors rather than employees, such workers have lacked job security, benefits, and in many cases even reliable work schedules.
While the law introduced by Ford's labour minister, Monte McNaughton would not address the employment status of gig workers, and applies only to hours spent "actively" driving customers or products, it does aim to establish a set of foundational rights, Mojtehedzadeh reported.
Still, the Ford government's apparent conversion leaves labour economists, among others, more than a little suspicious.
In 2018, the government rolled back planned minimum-wage increases, eliminated paid sick days and equal pay for equal work.
That was then. Now, Ford has appointed himself champion of working men and women.
On Monday, he reviewed some of the pocketbook measures he has recently announced. He's cutting the $120 licence sticker fee. He's cutting tolls on Highways 412 and 418. Earlier, to the applause of union leaders, he raised the minimum wage to $15.
"Our government listens to workers," he crowed. "We aren't leaving any workers behind, absolutely no one."
All of this prompted one reporter to ask this week if Ford had somehow found his inner liberal.
Well, the premier replied, "my kids call me a bleeding heart."
Perhaps. But on an initiative so driven by timing, the premier's may have been less than ideal.
David Doorey, an industrial relations professor at York University, said a decision issued by a labour ministry employment standards officer just days before Ford's announcement may have actually blown it out of the water.
The decision, which found Uber Eats had violated the Employment Standards Act, deemed a Toronto Uber Eats driver an "employee" for the purposes of the act and said its protections apply.
Moreover, the decision said that "deemed working hours include time spent waiting or holding oneself ready to work."
If that's the case, Doorey argued, the proposed Ontario law would actually reduce protections for gig workers, not improve them.
Uber has said it plans to appeal the decision to the Ontario Labour Relations Board.
Ford, of course, is playing to a different market and timeline as his government nears election day.
As a political tactic, it is an understandable move.
The strategy goes back 40 years or so to the suburban fringe around Detroit, when the phenomenon of "Reagan Democrats" was first identified in Michigan's Macomb County.
Blue-collar workers were - in large part for social and cultural reasons - voting Republican, feeling the Democrats they had traditionally supported had abandoned them.
That trend has continued in various ways across North America. And the premier is offering them a home in his Progressive Conservative party.
Even if he likely wouldn't have known Woody Guthrie from Sam Walton.

Will Tories take up populism?

Full text: Canada's Conservative party is changing. The question is whether it goes down a right-wing populist path - as Republicans south of the border have with Donald Trump - or whether it takes a centrist approach to appeal to a wider audience. In many ways, that question reveals the cracks in the nearly 20-year-old marriage of convenience between the Progressive Conservatives and the Canadian Alliance, one that risks ending up in a nasty divorce.
The only declared candidate, Carleton MP Pierre Poilievre, is a polarizing figure with a "take no prisoners" attitude. He recently called Europe's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine shockingly "weak," embraced the so-called "Freedom Convoy," and called COVID-19 public health measures a purposeful attempt by governments "to try and take away our freedom and give themselves more power."
In the past, Poilievre has attacked the media, made derogatory comments about Indigenous peoples, left the door open to a niqab ban in the public service and broken the election law. Elected at age 25, the career MP is a forceful opposition critic who has railed against elites, placed the blame for rising inflation and house prices at the feet of the Liberals and promised more energy projects. His campaign launch through a social media video on Feb. 5 garnered more than seven million views on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. At least 26 Conservative caucus members have endorsed him. Those who haven't hope for a more mature candidate with a unifying message.
That's what former Quebec premier Jean Charest, Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown and political commentator Tasha Kheiriddin want to offer. All three are current outsiders, and all hail from the Progressive Conservative side of the party.
Charest started his political career in 1984 under prime minister Brian Mulroney. He will meet with Conservative MPs - most of whom know little about him - on Wednesday in Ottawa. On Monday, Quebec's anti-corruption unit (UPAC) ended its eight-year probe into allegations the Quebec Liberal party engaged in illegal financing when Charest was at the helm. It's a welcome gift that clears the way for his candidacy.
Not that it will be a walk in the park. Jenni Byrne, Poilievre's strategist, laid out the attacks against Charest on Twitter, describing him as a "Liberal who campaigned against (prime minister) Stephen Harper," "supported the long-gun registry, raised taxes, brought in a carbon tax & worked for Huawei while the Chinese Govt detained kidnapped Canadians." Her offensive led to an ugly public dispute on Sunday with Charest organizer and Tory MP Alain Rayes.
Brown, a vocal opponent of Quebec's Bill 21, was a Conservative MP from 2006 until 2015, when he became leader of the Ontario PCs. Before resigning over allegations of sexual misconduct, which he strenuously denies, he sought to expand the Ontario party's tent by supporting carbon pricing and reaching out to ethnic communities.
Kheiriddin has never held elected office, but she is well known, bilingual, and has no baggage.
Their decisions about whether to enter the leadership contest depend on the rules of the game - which could be announced as early as Wednesday. Poilievre's camp wants a June vote and a membership cut-off of mid-May, sources said, giving any opponents little time to organize. His challengers would benefit from a longer race, with more time to sell memberships to newcomers and more time to be heard by existing members.
Charest and Brown will probably need to change the current makeup of the party - around 200,000 members - if they are to succeed. The Tories pick leaders through a weighted ranked ballot, in which every riding with more than 100 members is worth 100 points. Unless Poilievre were to win a majority in the first round, a race that includes Charest, Brown and Kheiriddin could see any of them benefit from each other's supporters.
Poilievre is already courting down-ballot support from social conservative favourite Leslyn Lewis, the Conservative MP for Haldimand-Norfolk. Independent York Centre MPP Roman Baber, a staunch opponent of COVID-19 restrictions, is also contemplating a run.
Back in 2017, Andrew Scheer was elected leader as the compromise candidate, supported by social conservatives, Quebec dairy farmers and members who didn't trust Maxime Bernier. In 2020, Erin O'Toole was also the compromise candidate, acceptable to social conservatives, and less centrist than Peter MacKay. In 2022, Poilievre is modelling himself as that candidate. But it's unclear that the parts of the party he's already alienated - namely the Quebec branch and those uncomfortable with his courtship of People's Party supporters - will be willing to unite behind him once this race is over.
In choosing a leader, the Conservatives must ask themselves what their winning formula will be -do they want to take votes from Bernier's far-right party or from Justin Trudeau's Liberals?

Full text: Ford’s opposition should vow to restore city council, Feb. 26
Sean Micallef makes the suggestion that the opposition parties should have an election plank to restore Toronto to 44 or 47 councillors.
Although I am not totally opposed to having more than the current 25 councillors, plus the Mayor, I would suggest that what was really wrong with Doug Ford’s decision in 2018 was the fact that he made the change without discussion and in the middle of an election campaign.
The result was making a change to one part of an interconnected system without looking at what councillors actually do and the role of Community Councils and Council, itself.
If a change is necessary, it should be made by Toronto, not the Province and should only occur after there has been a deep discussion of what the role of councillors should be and whether there are other and better systems.
The discussion needs to happen before we simply go back to “the good old days.”
These were really not as good as some people remember.

Full text: Premier Doug Ford's government is defending its "Ontario is getting stronger" TV commercial amid charges it's a thinly veiled, feel-good campaign ad at public expense.
With the provincial election coming June 2 - and the official campaign kicking off in two months - the ad that has appeared on the Super Bowl and other prime-time programs is an abuse of taxpayers' money, opposition parties said Tuesday.
And it has the Liberals facing a share of the blame for easing restrictions on government advertising in 2015, eliminating the power of the auditor general's office to veto ads for issues of factual accuracy, tone, context and political partisanship.
"If the previous rules were in place, we'd at least have the auditor reviewing the ads before they go out," Green Leader Mike Schreiner said. "That prevents government from engaging in using public dollars for partisan purposes."
While Ford's Progressive Conservatives campaigned in 2018 on a promise to restore the auditor general's advertising review powers, the premier's office signalled late last year it will not be doing so.
Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy told reporters the upbeat ad that shows blue-collar workers on the job, an electric vehicle being plugged in, public transit lines and highways without traffic jams are meant to convey a "sense of optimism" in the wake of challenging times.
New Democrat Leader Andrea Horwath described the ad as clearly designed to "pump up the government," and said that is "really problematic."
Specific costs for the ad campaign were not disclosed.

Double fares for trips linking to GO Transit nixed

Full text: The province is making public transportation more affordable by eliminating fares for trips that connect to GO Transit on most local services across the Greater Golden Horseshoe.
But while the policy will give riders in places like Brampton, Mississauga and Hamilton a break, it won't apply to TTC customers in Toronto.
Associate Transportation Minister Stan Cho announced the policy, which goes into effect March 14, at a bus garage in Mississauga on Tuesday morning.
He said that in addition to the Ontario PC government's recent decisions to eliminate tolls on Highways 412 and 418 in Durham and scrap licence plate sticker renewal fees for drivers, cutting transit fares is another way the province is making it more affordable for Ontarians struggling with rising costs to get around.
"Since Day One, our government has been making it easier for people to get from Point A to Point B," he said, noting that under Premier Doug Ford the province is investing billions in new public transit lines.
"We know that effective transit infrastructure means more than just laying subway track. It must be accessible and that's why today we're cutting the cost of taking transit," Cho said.
The province's announcement means trips connecting to GO Transit will be free on city transit agencies that have co-fare agreements with GO: Durham Region Transit, Milton Transit, Grand River Transit, Guelph Transit, Oakville Transit, MiWay, Brampton Transit, Hamilton Street Railway, Burlington Transit, Bradford West Gwillimbury Transit, York Region Transit and Barrie Transit. Riders transferring between the local services and GO would still have to pay the GO fare.
The province estimates a Mississauga resident who commutes three days a week using MiWay and GO would save about $250 a year as a result of the new co-fare policy.
The cost of the program to the province would depend on the extent to which ridership rebounds from COVID-19, but Metrolinx, the provincial agency that operates GO, has budgeted $1.5 million annually.
In 2020, the Ontario PC government pulled the plug on a popular program introduced by the previous Liberal government that provided discounts of $1.50 for riders transferring between the TTC and GO or the UP Express. The discounted double fare, which cost more than $18 million a year, was pitched by the Liberals as a crucial step in regional fare integration, but the Ontario PCs let its funding expire.
Cho didn't rule out extending the new discount to the TTC, which is by far the largest local transit agency in the region, at some point in the future.
"A project of this size and the changes we're making do take a little bit of time, so the discussions with the TTC will be ongoing. The ultimate goal is to make sure we connect the entire grid," he said.
Ontario Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca, who was transportation minister when the province introduced the TTC-GO discounted double fare in 2018, said Ford's decision to scrap that policy was "reckless." He called Tuesday's announcement a transparent attempt to win votes ahead of the June 2 provincial election.
With just over three months until the vote, "suddenly Doug Ford has seen the light and has decided that he has to make transit more affordable," Del Duca said.
"I think people can see that for what it is. It's electioneering. It's trying to convince people to not remember the brutal mistakes that Doug Ford has made consistently over the past four years."

Full text: Canada's opposition lawmakers are backing the Liberal governent's response to the crisis in Ukraine - for now. But their calls for further action hint at political fault lines that could crack that united front.
The Conservative interim leader, Candice Bergen, told the Commons during a parliamentary debate Monday night that the Official Opposition "fully supports the actions of the government of Canada taken so far" in response to the Russian invasion.
But Conservatives are demanding additional steps. Those include the expulsion of Russia's ambassador to Canada and the recall of Canada's envoy in Moscow, which the Liberal government has rejected saying it's important to have diplomatic eyes and ears in Moscow in a war fuelled by disinformation.
The Tories want the federal government to "direct" the CRTC to revoke the broadcasting licence of RT, formerly Russia Today (which has been dropped by Rogers, Bell, Telus and Shaw), notwithstanding the independence of Canada's broadcast media regulator. The Trudeau government is asking the CRTC to review the licence.
Bergen called on Trudeau to work to evict Russia from multilateral forums like the G20 and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe - something Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly said Monday is under discussion.
Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Joly along with her Danish counterpart led a walkout in Geneva to protest a broadcast of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's speech to the UN Human Rights Council.
Joly told reporters it was to protest Lavrov's "false" version of what was happening in Ukraine.
She said Canada on Tuesday would "petition the International Criminal Court of Justice against Russia for crimes against humanity and war crimes."
Canada and global allies have already targeted sanctions at Russian President Vladimir Putin, his inner governing circle, key ministers, Russian parliament members, Putin's allies in nearby Belarus, Russian financial institutions and companies connected to Russian billionaires - the oligarchs and ruling elite who Trudeau said profit from the economic stability and systems that western democracies have built.
Ottawa has also sent lethal and non-lethal military aid, including anti-tank weapons and defensive gear like armoured vests, helmets, and goggles.
The Conservatives, Bloc Québécois and the NDP are calling for Canada to offer visa-free travel to Ukrainians who are fleeing the conflict - a step the Liberal government hasn't yet taken.
Bergen also used the Ukraine crisis to highlight the Conservative party's long-standing criticisms of Liberal policies on defence spending and procurement, a call to update northern warning capabilities, to protect the Arctic, and to build more oil and gas pipelines.
She said when "the Liberals stop, delay and hamstring Canadian oil and gas from being extracted, transported and sold both at home and abroad, the biggest winner in every way, shape and form is Putin."
"We need to get new pipelines built, so that we can sell our energy to Europe and others and end Russia's monopoly on natural gas."
The U.S. has been co-ordinating for weeks with various allies to ensure there are backup energy supplies for Europe during a conflict.
Although Canada has oil and natural gas supplies, it does not yet have liquefied natural gas (LNG) refining capacity. While Canadian LNG could be shipped south via rail, U.S. refineries are already running at full capacity, senior government officials told the Star.
Conservative leadership candidate Pierre Poilievre posted a video using the Ukraine crisis as part of his leadership campaign, saying "as prime minister" he'd quickly approve Canadian oil and gas projects and refineries.
Poilievre lambasted the Trudeau government and said "major" European countries are "cowering" in the face of Putin's aggression. The "weakest" are those that depend on Russian oil and gas.
"Europe is filling Putin's war chest," says Poilievre.
New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh called on the Trudeau government to sharply increase its humanitarian aid in addition to lifting visas for Ukrainians.
On Tuesday, the UN issued an urgent appeal for more than $2 billion to urgently deliver humanitarian support to people in Ukraine and refugees in neighbouring countries.
In the past two weeks Canada has approved more than 4,000 applications from Ukrainians who'd already applied to come to or remain in Canada, Immigration Minister Sean Fraser said Monday.
The Bloc Québécois - which up to two weeks ago criticized the Trudeau government for "crying wolf" and "alarmist" rhetoric about Putin's intentions - on Monday supported Canada's response to date, while calling for the lifting of visas, and rejecting the need to build more pipelines.

Full text: The latest on Russia and Ukraine from Canada and around the world Wednesday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available .
11:06 p.m. The Northwest Territories' infrastructure minister says a plane carrying Russian nationals on its way to the High Arctic was grounded Tuesday in Yellowknife.
Diane Archie told the legislature Wednesday that the plane appeared to be on its way to Resolute, Nunavut, with people who were planning to take an overland expedition in a large all-terrain utility vehicle.
Canada closed its airspace to Russian-owned or operated aircraft on Sunday following President Vladimir Putin's attack on Ukraine.
Archie says federal authorities were informed of the landing and it was being investigated by Transport Canada and the Canada Border Services Agency.
Transport Canada said in a statement late Wednesday that the charter aircraft that landed in Yellowknife was carrying two Russian foreign nationals.
Transport Canada says it will review whether there has been any violation of the recently announced notice prohibiting Russian aircraft that are owned, charted, or certified from operating in Canadian airspace.
"Potential consequences and enforcement actions will be determined based on the facts," Transport Canada said in an email.
"We can tell you that all travellers arriving in Canada are subject to strict screening measures and must demonstrate they meet the requirements to enter the country."
9:48 p.m.: Bryson Woolsey is trading in his chef's apron and the luxury of home for ammunition and danger to help people in Ukraine during their time of crisis.
The 33-year-old cook from Powell River, B.C., said he "dropped the frying pan" to answer Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's call for foreigners to join an "international brigade" to defeat Russia.
"It's not my desire to go into combat and just shoot people. That's not the reason," he said in an interview. "There's something happening right now, and I have the capacity to help in some way."
While heads of state hammer out sanctions to slow down and stop Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, people from all walks of life are answering Kyiv’s call to arms regardless of personal risk and training.
Yet while Ottawa has largely adopted a hands-off approach, saying the decision to fight is up to individuals, some are worried about the potential legal and national security questions of having a large number of Canadians head off to war.
8:10 p.m.: The world has embraced Ukraine, its cause and its camera-friendly president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The world has shunned Russia, its military aggression and its increasingly isolated leader, Vladimir Putin.
But there are still many Russians who offer no apologies for what Moscow calls a “special military operation” in Ukraine and who harbour no doubt about the man who ordered it, writes Allen Woods.
In justifying the decision to dispatch forces into Ukraine, Putin has cited the “genocide” being carried out in the eastern Donbas region, which is home to a Russian-speaking majority. He has referred to the Ukrainian leadership as “neo-Nazis” and “drug addicts.” (Experts say claims of a genocide against Russians in the Donbas region are baseless.)
The depth of Putin’s anger, which has surprised many longtime Kremlin observers, is deep.
As it is for those who continue to back him, despite international condemnation.
Full story from Allen Woods here: The Russia-Ukraine conflict is not in its eighth day, it’s in its eighth year
8 p.m.: The U.N. refugee agency says 1 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia’s invasion less than a week ago, an exodus without precedent in this century for its speed.
The tally from UNHCR amounts to more than 2 percent of Ukraine’s population on the move in under a week. The World Bank counted the population at 44 million at the end of 2020.
The U.N. agency has predicted that up to 4 million people could eventually leave Ukraine but cautioned that even that projection could be revised upward.
In an email, UNHCR spokesperson Joung-ah Ghedini-Williams wrote: “Our data indicates we passed the 1M mark” as of midnight in central Europe, based on counts collected by national authorities.
On Twitter, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, wrote: “In just seven days we have witnessed the exodus of one million refugees from Ukraine to neighboring countries.”
Syria, whose civil war erupted in 2011, currently remains the country with the largest refugee outflows – at more than 5.6 million people, according to UNHCR figures. But even at the swiftest rate of flight by refugees out of Syria, in early 2013, it took at least three months for 1 million refugees to leave that country.
UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo said Wednesday that “at this rate” the outflows from Ukraine could make it the source of “the biggest refugee crisis this century.”
7:40 p.m.: The Przemyśl train station is a spot that’s come to be known in the last six days for its heartwarming scenes of volunteers welcoming tired and hungry refugees with a cup of hot tea and a smile. On a grey Wednesday morning, however, under a brooding, overcast sky, tension is building on the ground.
Yellow-vested volunteers, who days before held their positions alone outside, are now crowded out by a heavy police presence. Officers in green and blue uniforms pace through the parking lot of the square, and tall guards frame the entryway to the platforms, scanning everyone who makes their way in and out of the building.
“It’s really scary now,” says Soufiane, an Algerian volunteer who’s been offering translation services in Arabic, French, English and Polish. The change, he explains, was the immediate result of the actions carried out the night before by a group of alt-right supporters targeting refugees who fled the Russian invasion.
Tuesday evening, a Polish outlet shared video footage of a dozen black-hooded men descending on the train station. Their targets, explained the reporter who was quick enough to pull out her phone when she saw the men rushing the station, were the arriving refugees. But, she adds, only the ones who “looked like they weren’t Ukrainian.”
Among hundreds of thousands of refugees from Ukraine arriving in Poland are Africans, Indians and others lacking Ukrainian passports. Some reported racist treatment by officials on the Ukrainian side.

7:40 p.m.: In a video address to the nation early Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave an upbeat assessment of the war and called on Ukrainians to keep up the resistance.
“We are a people who in a week have destroyed the plans of the enemy,” he said. “They will have no peace here. They will have no food. They will have here not one quiet moment.”
Zelenskyy didn’t comment on whether the Russians have seized several cities, including Kherson.
“If they went somewhere, then only temporarily. We’ll drive them out,” he said.
He said the fighting is taking a toll on the morale of Russian soldiers, who “go into grocery stores and try to find something to eat.”
“These are not warriors of a superpower,” he said. “These are confused children who have been used.”
He said the Russian death toll has reached about 9,000.
“Ukraine doesn’t want to be covered in bodies of soldiers,” he said. “Go home.”
7:30 p.m.: U.S. President Joe Biden is hailing Wednesday’s vote by the United Nations General Assembly demanding an immediate halt to Moscow’s attack on Ukraine and the withdrawal of all Russian troops, saying it “demonstrates the extent of global outrage at Russia’s horrific assault on a sovereign neighbor.”
In a statement Wednesday evening, Biden said the U.N. vote recognizes that Russian President Vladimir Putin is “attacking the very foundations of global peace and security — and everything the United Nations stands for.”
7:15 p.m.: Pressure is building on the federal government to make it far simpler for Ukrainians to seek safe haven in Canada with provincial and local lawmakers adding their voices to demands that Ottawa remove barriers to immigration.
Federal immigration officials are already expediting existing applications from Ukrainians seeking to come to Canada either permanently or temporarily. But as the invasion by Russia continues, a greater urgency is being attached not just to processing those files but accepting thousands more people now pouring out of the country as fighting intensifies.
Changes could be coming as early as Thursday as work continues behind the scenes to tweak existing immigration requirements, most notably that Ukrainians need a visa to enter Canada to visit.
Conservatives and New Democrats continued to call for the government to drop that requirement, arguing time is of the essence for people fearing for their lives. Some include members of their own families.
Conservative MP Len Webber cited his relatives having fled the city of Kyiv, although they are not yet out of danger, while Conservative MP Laila Goodridge spoke of a family whose seven children would have safe harbour in Canada if only the visa requirement were removed.
“Over half a million innocent people have already had to leave everything they have ever known, many with just the shirts on their backs,” Goodridge told the House of Commons. “What we are witnessing is a humanitarian crisis. Many are looking for temporary safety here in Canada because, ultimately, Ukraine is home and when it is safe, they will go back home.”

6:50 p.m.: As the Russian invasion of Ukraine enters its second week, the call to aid Ukraine in its fight against Vladimir Putin is being answered by an increasing number of people .
From coast to coast, Canadians are donating medical supplies and safety gear, like military helmets. Others are providing cash for defence and humanitarian efforts, even as the Kremlin is stepping up its attacks on Ukrainian resistance.
For a man from Toronto on the ground in Poland, the help for refugees has been more direct, while in Winnipeg a group has collected thousands of kilograms of humanitarian aid — everything from radios to diapers.
Here’s how some Canadian organizations and individuals are aiding Ukraine’s struggle.

6:30 p.m.: On Sunday, thousands of people gathered in Toronto for a demonstration against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. High-profile politicians joined the rally , including Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, Toronto Mayor John Tory and Conservative MP James Bezan.
Just before 5 p.m., Freeland, who is Ukrainian-Canadian, tweeted a photo with the caption: “We stand united. We stand with Ukraine.”
In the photo, Freeland stands behind a red-and-black scarf featuring the words Slava Ukraini (Glory to Ukraine) written in Ukrainian. On Monday morning, the tweet had been deleted. A new tweet shared the same message with a similar photo from the rally, but this time without the red and black scarf.
The scarf’s colours are polarizing: while black-and-red banners have a storied place in Ukrainian culture, the colours were also found on the flag flown by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, or UPA — a paramilitary organization accused of committing atrocities against Jews and Polish civilians in the Second World War, and associated with the resurgent far right in Ukraine today.
By Tuesday evening, the photo had become the subject of social-media controversy and several right-wing news outlets in Canada and the United States published stories accusing Freeland of marching with a pro-Nazi banner.
Full story here from Richie Assaly: The controversy over Chrystia Freeland and the Ukrainian scarf, explained
6:18 p.m.: Russian forces captured the strategically important hub of Kherson on Wednesday, Ukrainian officials said, making it the first major city to be overcome by President Vladimir Putin’s forces since the invasion began Feb. 24.
The fall of Kherson — a city of 300,000 people, northwest of the Crimean peninsula — is significant because it would allow the Russians to control more of Ukraine’s southern coastline and to push west toward the city of Odessa.
Kherson Mayor Igor Kolykhaev and a senior Ukrainian government official confirmed that Kherson had fallen. Russian forces had encircled the city, said Kolykhaev, and after days of intense fighting, Ukrainian forces retreated toward the nearby city of Mykolaiv.
“There is no Ukrainian army here,” he said. “The city is surrounded.”
About 10 armed Russian officers, including the Russian commander, had entered city hall, Kolykhaev said, and had plans to establish a Russian administrative centre there.
A senior Pentagon official said that Russian forces across Ukraine continued to suffer logistical problems and that Russia’s military leadership had become much more aggressive in targeting civilian infrastructure inside cities.
5:45 p.m.: Vladimir Putin’s meandering rant on the eve of invading Ukraine demonstrated that his deranged torment and bitterness over failing to restore Russia’s imperial greatness has advanced to psychopathological megalomania, writes contributor Charles Burton.
In his 70th year and with more than two decades in power, Putin is obsessed with achieving military dominance beyond Ukraine to the other nations of the defunct Warsaw Pact, at any cost.
Convinced he has been foiled by American treachery, he will not be deterred by massive sanctions that bring great suffering to ordinary Russians. Putin threatens to deploy nuclear weapons if he doesn’t get his way. If we did not take his menacing speeches seriously before, we had better do so now.

5:40 p.m.: The International Criminal Court’s prosecutor opened an investigation Wednesday into possible war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide in Ukraine dating back to 2013, but also covering the conflict sparked by Russia’s invasion.
Prosecutor Karim Khan said he launched the probe after 39 of the court’s member states requested an investigation, a process known as a referral.
“These referrals enable my Office to proceed with opening an investigation into the Situation in Ukraine from 21 November 2013 onwards, thereby encompassing within its scope any past and present allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide committed on any part of the territory of Ukraine by any person,” Khan said in a statement.
“Our work in the collection of evidence has now commenced,” he added.
5:25 p.m.: The UN Human Rights Commission says there have been at least 536 civilian casualties in Ukraine. The numbers include 136 civilian deaths, including 13 kids, and 400 more injured. As these are the only casualties the UN could confirm, the real toll is likely much higher, officials say.
Earlier, Ukraine said that 2,000 civilians have died so far, although that number could not be independently verified.
5:25 p.m.: Less than two weeks ago, Dmytro Pidruchnyi was competing at the Winter Olympics in Ukraine’s national colours. Now he’s wearing a military uniform and ballistic helmet.
Pidruchnyi is a world champion in biathlon, which combines skiing and shooting, and a three-time Olympian. He returned home from Beijing last week just before Russia launched its invasion of his country.
“I’m currently in my hometown Ternopil serving in the National Guard of Ukraine,” he posted on Instagram on Tuesday under a picture in uniform. “This photo was taken during air alarm.”
Pidruchnyi is one of many athletes who have joined up with the Ukrainian armed forces.
5:22 p.m.: Defending democracy isn’t always cheap. Doing the right thing can come with a cost , writes the Star’s editorial board.
Canadians and others, therefore, should not be dismayed when they hear that imposing sanctions and cutting business ties with Russia to punish its government for invading the sovereign nation of Ukraine will mean some economic pain.
Compared to what Ukrainians are suffering right now, the costs will likely be tiny. But, as Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland warned this week , they will be real in the form of lost exports and higher energy prices.
Western countries aren’t prepared to go to war to stop Vladimir Putin’s attempt to bring Ukraine to heel. That’s understandable, given that Russia has the world’s biggest nuclear arsenal and there’s a real chance that Putin might actually use it.
But there are other ways of punishing the Russian leadership. The economic sanctions imposed by Canada and other western countries are the strongest ever used, and they’re getting tougher as governments see how bravely Ukrainians are resisting the invaders and are frankly shamed into acting more boldly.
Individual businesses and institutions, should play their part. So kudos to the approximately 100 Canadian business leaders and investment managers who this week vowed to get out of their Russian investments and urged others to do the same.

5:25 p.m.: The International Criminal Court’s prosecutor opened an investigation Wednesday into possible war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide in Ukraine dating back to 2013, but also covering the conflict sparked by Russia’s invasion.
Prosecutor Karim Khan said he launched the probe after 39 of the court’s member states requested an investigation, a process known as a referral.
“These referrals enable my Office to proceed with opening an investigation into the Situation in Ukraine from 21 November 2013 onwards, thereby encompassing within its scope any past and present allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide committed on any part of the territory of Ukraine by any person,” Khan said in a statement.
“Our work in the collection of evidence has now commenced,” he added.
4:50 p.m.: A Russian official says troops have taken the Ukrainian port city of Kherson — a claim that the Ukrainian military denies.
The city is under Russian soldiers’ “complete control,” Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said Wednesday.
He said that the city’s civilian infrastructure, essential facilities and transport are operating as usual and that there are no shortages of food or essential goods.
Konashenkov said talks between the Russian commanders, city administrations and regional authorities on how to maintain order in the city were underway Wednesday. The claims could not be immediately verified.
A senior U.S. defence official said Wednesday that they have seen claims that the Russians have taken Kherson, but that the Ukrainian military is rejecting that claim.
“Our view is that Kherson is very much a contested city at this point,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to make military assessments.
4:30 p.m.: Most of the world lined up against Moscow at the United Nations on Wednesday to demand it withdraw from Ukraine, as invading Russian forces renewed their bombardment of the country’s second-biggest city, menaced its capital and besieged its strategic ports.
Russia reported its military casualties for the first time since the invasion began last week, saying nearly 500 of its troops have been killed and almost 1,600 wounded. Ukraine did not disclose its own military losses but said more than 2,000 civilians have died, a claim that could not be independently verified.
Envoys from Ukraine and Russia are expected to meet Thursday in Belarus for a second round of talks aimed at ending the fighting. But there appeared to be little common ground between the two sides.
Seven days into Russia’s invasion, the U.N. said more than 870,000 people have fled Ukraine in a mounting refugee crisis on the European continent, while the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency warned that the fighting poses a danger to Ukraine’s 15 nuclear reactors.
4:08 p.m.: Sweden says four Russian fighter jets violated its airspace over the Baltic Sea on Wednesday.
The four aircraft — two SU-27 and two SU-24 fighters — flew briefly over Swedish airspace east of the island of Gotland, according to a statement from the Swedish Armed Forces.
“In light of the current situation we are very concerned about the incident,” Swedish Air Force chief Carl-Johan Edstrom said. “This is unprofessional and irresponsible behaviour from the Russian side.”
Swedish fighter jets were scrambled and took photos of the Russian jets, the statement said.
“This shows that our readiness is good. We were in place to secure the territorial integrity and Swedish borders,” Edstrom said. “We have total control of the situation.”
3:20 p.m.: The spectre of a war on the other side of the planet haunts this storefront where young Ukrainians are packing up suitcases full of boots, gloves and other protective gear, as well as drones, to be sent to Ukraine to aide the fight against Russia’s invasion.
The equipment is desperately needed in Ukraine as Russian forces continue their assault, which began Feb. 24.
Standing in the middle of the floor full of bags, steeled and mostly silent as he looks over the gear, is 26-year-old Oleh Hlyniailiuk. His plan: to take up to 10 of these suitcases with him on a March 2 flight to Austria and then on to Ukraine by car.
“This is surreal,” the svelte Hlyniailiuk told the Star. “I can’t even fully understand what’s happening right now with me. It’s just got a different reality.”
Full story here from Jeremy Nuttall and Omar Mosleh: As people flee war in Ukraine, some Canadians are travelling there to help fight the Russians
3:15 p.m.: The Dutch are sending rocket launchers for air defence. The Estonians are sending Javelin anti-tank missiles. The Poles and the Latvians are sending Stinger surface-to-air missiles. The Czechs are sending machine guns, sniper rifles, pistols and ammunition.
Even formerly neutral countries like Sweden and Finland are sending weapons. And Germany, long allergic to sending weapons into conflict zones, is sending Stingers as well as other shoulder-launched rockets.
In all, about 20 countries — most members of NATO and the European Union, but not all — are funneling arms into Ukraine to fight off Russian invaders and arm an insurgency, if the war comes to that.
At the same time, NATO is moving military equipment and as many as 22,000 more troops into member states bordering Russia and Belarus, to reassure them and enhance deterrence.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine has brought European countries together, minds concentrated by the larger threat to European security presented by the Russia of President Vladimir Putin.
3 p.m.: A Quebec restaurant has dropped the word “poutine” from some of its branding because the famous dish shares a name with Russia’s president.
Drummondville, Que., diner Le Roy Jucep announced last week on Facebook it was temporarily removing the word “poutine” from some of its online branding to express its “deep dismay” over Russian aggression in Ukraine.
In French, Vladimir Putin’s last name is written and pronounced “Poutine,” exactly like Quebec’s signature dish.
The restaurant has since deleted the post, but its Facebook page still describes it as the inventor of the “Fries cheese gravy” rather than poutine.
2:50 p.m.: Ukrainian officials have reported a powerful explosion in Kyiv, between the Southern Railway station and the Ibis hotel, an area near Ukraine’s Defense Ministry.
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office told The Associated Press on Wednesday night that it was a missile strike.
Officials said it wasn’t immediately clear how damaging the strike was, whether there were any casualties or where exactly the missile hit.
2:50 p.m.: On today’s ‘This Matters’: Russia has been using cyber attacks on Ukraine for years, and now both sides are escalating their use of technology and information warfare amid the ground conflict.
Experts like James Lewis warn that there could be new and innovative uses of strategies like hacking and malware to disrupt forces during this conflict. There are also fears that these digital warfare tactics could spread to other shores where civilian or military infrastructure could potentially be a target.
Listen to today’s episode here: Modern warfare: Cyber attacks, hacking and the Russian-Ukrainian conflict
2:43 p.m.: Some of the nearly 1 million people who have fled Russia’s devastating war in Ukraine in recent days count among society’s most vulnerable, unable to make the decision on their own to flee and requiring careful assistance to make the journey to safety.
At the train station in the Hungarian town of Zahony on Wednesday, more than 200 young Ukrainians with disabilities — residents of two orphanages in Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv — disembarked into the cold wind of the train platform after an arduous escape from the violence gripping Ukraine.
The refugees, most of them children with mental and physical disabilities, were evacuated from their care facilities once the Russian assault on the capital intensified.
“It wasn’t safe to stay there, there were rockets, they were shooting at Kyiv,” said Larissa Leonidovna, the director of the Svyatoshinksy orphanage in Kyiv. “We spent more than an hour underground during a bombing.”
The U.N. refugee agency says more than 874,000 people have fled Ukraine since Russia’s invasion last week and the figure is “rising exponentially,” putting it on track to cross the 1 million mark on Wednesday.
Moving from the train in groups of 30, the children — also from the Darnytskyy orphanage in Kyiv — were escorted to buses waiting to take them to Opole, Poland, where they would be settled and receive further care
2:30 p.m.: A senior U.S. defence official says the Russian convoy still appears to be stalled outside the city centre of Kyiv, and has made no real progress in the last couple days.
The official on Wednesday said the convoy is still plagued with fuel and food shortages and logistical problems, as well as facing continued fierce resistance from Ukrainians.
He said there has been an increase in the number of missiles and artillery targeting the city, suggesting the Russians are trying to make a more aggressive move to try and take the city.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military assessments, said Russians have not been able to achieve air superiority and Ukrainian air defences remain operable and their aircraft continue to fly.
The official said that about 82% of the Russian troops that had been arrayed around Ukraine are now inside the country — just a slight uptick over the last 24 hours, and that Russia has launched more than 450 missiles at various targets in the country.
In other areas of the country, the U.S. official said that the U.S. is seeing preliminary indications that Russian forces are going to try to move south towards Mariupol from Donetsk, in what appears to be an effort to encircle the city.
2:14 p.m.: The White House has announced additional sanctions against Russia and its ally Belarus, including extending export controls that target Russian oil refining and entities supporting the Russian and Belarusian military.
Among Wednesday’s new measures are sanctions targeting 22 Russia defence entities that make combat aircraft, infantry fighting vehicles, electronic warfare systems, missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicles for Russia’s military.
The U.S. Commerce Department also announced additional export controls on oil and gas extraction equipment that would hurt Russia’s refining capacity over the long term.
The Biden administration, and Western allies, have largely stayed away from hitting the Russian energy sector to avoid causing tremors to the global supply of energy. The White House, however, said in a statement that U.S. and allies “share a strong interest in degrading Russia’s status as a leading energy supplier over time.”
The latest sanctions imposed on Wednesday include the U.S. closing off its air space to all Russian flights. President Joe Biden previewed that he would making the move in his State of the Union address on Tuesday evening.
1:50 p.m.: With the threat of financial sanctions looming, Chelsea’s Russian owner Roman Abramovich confirmed Wednesday he is trying to sell the Premier League club he turned into an elite trophy-winning machine with his lavish investment.
The speed of Abramovich’s pending exit from Chelsea is striking as he was trying to instigate a plan this past weekend to relinquish some control in order to keep the club under his ownership.
But as Russia’s war on Ukraine entered a seventh day, pressure was growing on the British government to include him among the wealthy Russians to be targeted in sanctions.
“In the current situation, I have therefore taken the decision to sell the club, as I believe this is in the best interest of the club, the fans, the employees, as well as the club’s sponsors and partners,” Abramovich said in a statement.
Abramovich said he will not be asking to be repaid 1.5 billion pounds ($2 billion) in loans he has granted the club during 19 years of injecting cash to elevate the team into one of the most successful in Europe.
“I have instructed my team to set up a charitable foundation where all net proceeds from the sale will be donated,” he said. “The foundation will be for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine.”
1:45 p.m. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin for the second time in the past week as Moscow intensified its invasion of Ukraine.
Putin and Modi on Wednesday reviewed the situation in Ukraine, especially in the city of Kharkiv where many Indian students are stuck, according to a statement from Arindam Bagchi, India’s External Affairs Ministry spokesperson. They discussed the safe evacuation of the Indian nationals from the conflict areas, Bagchi said.
The telephone conversation between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Putin came as the U.N. General Assembly approved a resolution demanding that Russia stop war in Ukraine and withdraw all troops.
1:30 p.m. A top aide for Russian President Vladimir Putin says Ukrainians are on their way to Belarus for talks that have been scheduled for Thursday.
“As far as I know, the Ukrainian delegation has already departed from Kyiv, is en route ... We’re expecting them tomorrow,” Vladimir Medinsky, the head of the Russian delegation, told reporters Wednesday evening
According to Medinsky, the two sides agreed on the Brest region of Belarus, which borders Poland, as the site of the talks.
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office confirmed to The Associated Press that the delegation is on its way, but gave no details on the time of the arrival.
1:20 p.m. (Updated) The Canadian government sent conflicting signals Wednesday about whether it would compensate Canadian companies or industries hurt by sanctions imposed on Russians or Russian companies.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said sanctions “obviously have a cost at home. That’s how international trade works,” he said, echoing a warning a day earlier by Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland.
Freeland had said Canadians should be prepared for that impact as the cost of fighting for democracy and a global rules-based order.
But Trudeau suggested in French that because punitive sanctions are necessary to persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin to reverse his decision to invade Ukraine, the government could try to offset the pain that might be felt here in Canada.

1 p.m. The spokesman of the Russian Defense Ministry says 498 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine and 1,597 more sustained wounds.
Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov on Wednesday rejected reports about “incalculable losses” of the Russians as “disinformation” and revealed Russia’s military casualties in Ukraine for the first time since the start of the invasion last Thursday. He assured that families of those killed are receiving all necessary assistance.
Konashenkov also said that neither conscripts, nor cadets have been involved in the operation in Ukraine, dismissing media reports alleging otherwise.
12:40 p.m. France’s National Center for Scientific Research, a huge state-run network of scientists across the country, is suspending all new collaboration with Russian counterparts.
In its announcement Wednesday, the CNRS, as it is known, strongly condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
“It is unacceptable that in the 21st century such a conflict could see the light of day within Europe,” a statement said.
12:30 p.m. As the war in Ukraine pushed into its seventh day, fierce Ukrainian resistance continued to deny the Kremlin the easy victory it had anticipated, even as Russian forces advanced in the south while edging closer to a capital buffeted by fear. They were also intensifying the indiscriminate bombing of civilian targets, potentially altering the war’s dynamics by increasing the human toll.
The Russian military was bearing down on several Ukrainian cities, including Kherson, a port near the Black Sea, whose capture would mark the first major city to come under full control of President Vladimir Putin’s forces since the invasion began Feb. 24. Russia claims it is fully in control of the city, but Ukrainian officials said the municipal government was still in place. Neither claim could be independently verified. Kherson’s mayor said the city was “waiting for a miracle” to collect bodies and restore basic services.
In Kyiv, blasts were reported overnight and Russian forces appeared to be moving to encircle the capital. A military convoy with hundreds of vehicles remained north of the city, a possible prelude to an assault.
12:20 p.m. The U.N. General Assembly voted Wednesday to demand that Russia stop its offensive in Ukraine and withdraw all troops, with nations from world powers to tiny island states condemning Moscow’s actions.
The vote was 141 to 5, with 35 abstentions. It came after the 193-member assembly convened its first emergency session since 1997.
Assembly resolutions aren’t legally binding, but they do have clout in reflecting international opinion. A Russian veto sank a similar resolution in the more powerful U.N. Security Council on Friday, but the assembly allows no vetoes. Under special emergency session rules, a resolution needs approval of two-thirds of those countries voting, and abstentions don’t count.
More than 90 countries co-sponsored the assembly resolution. It deplored Russia’s “aggression” against Ukraine “in the strongest terms” and demanded an immediate halt to Moscow’s use of force and the immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of all Russian forces from Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders. The measure also called on Russia to reverse a decision to recognize two separatist parts of eastern Ukraine as independent.
12 p.m . Airplane manufacturer Boeing says it has suspended major operations in Moscow and temporarily closed its office in Kyiv.
The company said in a statement it is also suspending parts, maintenance and technical support services for Russian airlines.
“As the conflict continues, our teams are focused on ensuring the safety of our teammates in the region,” the statement said.
11:45 a.m. Sony is donating $2 million (U.S.) as humanitarian aid to Ukraine though the United Nations Refugee Agency and aid group Save the Children.
The Japanese electronics and entertainment company has already said it will halt theatrical releases in Russia. Upcoming films include Morbius, starring the Marvel comics hero.
“Our thoughts and prayers are with all those who have been impacted and hope this crisis will be resolved quickly,” Sony Pictures said in a statement.
11:35 a.m. A firm that tracks cryptocurrency transactions says $33.8 million (U.S.) in the digital currency has been donated to Ukraine’s government and non-governmental organizations there since the start of Russia’s invasion, nearly a third of it on Tuesday.
Chief Scientist Tom Robinson of Elliptic said most donations to date have been in bitcoin and ether. Some people are sending nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, to the Ukrainian government’s ethereum account.
Ukraine issued a plea for contributions on Twitter last week. To date, it has received 30,000 donations, including $5.8 million from Gavin Wood, the British programmer who co-founded ethereum. There have been several other donations of more than $1 million.
10:40 a.m. Russian forces Wednesday pressed ahead with a wide-ranging but slow-moving offensive targeting key Ukrainian cities, menacing the capital of Kyiv with a miles-long military convoy, launching deadly strikes on the second-largest city of Kharkiv and apparently breaching a strategic Black Sea port city with tanks and troops.
On the seventh day of an offensive marked by fierce Ukrainian resistance in the face of Russian firepower, the Kremlin said a delegation was ready to hold evening talks with Ukrainian representatives at an undisclosed location. An initial session Sunday on the Ukraine-Belarus border produced no breakthroughs.
With President Joe Biden vowing in his Tuesday night State of the Union address to make Russian President Vladimir Putin pay a heavy price for the unprovoked attack on Ukraine, its defenders — a motley mix of regular army troops and ad hoc civilian militias — braced for an expected full-scale attack on Kyiv, a city of 3 million people.
9:20 a.m. Mariupol’s mayor says the city is suffering from mass casualties and a water outage due to attacks, saying they had been relentless.
“We cannot even take the wounded from the streets, from houses and apartments today, since the shelling does not stop,” Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying.
Boychenko referred to Russia’s actions as a “genocide” — using the same word Putin has used to justify the invasion.
8:35 a.m . Ukraine’s State Emergency Service says over 2,000 civilians are dead in a week of war, though it was impossible to verify that claim.
8 a.m. Russia renewed its assault Wednesday on Ukraine’s second-largest city in a pounding that lit up the skyline with balls of fire over populated areas.
The continued onslaught against Kharkiv came even as both sides said they were ready to resume talks aimed at stopping the new and devastating war in Europe.
It was not clear when new talks might take place, or where, or what they would yield. Ukraine’s leader earlier said Russia must stop bombing before another meeting.Volodymyr Zelenskyy has decried Russia’s bombardment as a blatant terror campaign.
7:55 a.m. Russian and Belarusian athletes will participate as neutrals at the Paralympics.They will compete under the Paralympic flag and not be included in the medal table.
7:47 a.m. Taking a chance on finding a new life outside of the harrowing reality of war sometimes begins with taking a chance on a stranger. On Tuesday night, that proved to be true for a busload of Ukrainian refugees arriving from the Medyka border crossing.
They are waiting in the parking lot of a defunct grocery store that has since been converted into a temporary relief and rest centre. Inside the buses are refugees who either didn’t have someone there to pick them up, or had no clue where they were headed when they packed up to escape the war only a 15-minute drive down the road from where they now perch.
Outside the bus, men and women stand shoulder to shoulder waving posters — some printed on what looks to be the backs of old pizza boxes — with destinations that could hold the name of their new home.

7:45 a.m. Canadians should expect the pain of Western sanctions against Russia to boomerang on our economy, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland warned Tuesday, as Ottawa blacklisted several more of President Vladimir Putin’s top political lieutenants and said Russian oligarchs with holdings in Canada are now in the crosshairs.
After attending a meeting of G7 finance ministers on Tuesday, Freeland said the embattled government of Ukraine presented “creative” ideas of how to ramp up economic pressure on the Russian president.
However, she said, the strategy is unlikely to come without a cost to Canadians.

7:27 a.m. As Russian tanks rolling through Ukrainian cities meet fierce local resistance, some of Canada’s top business leaders are fighting the invasion another way — by pulling their money out of Russia.
More than 100 of Canada’s top business leaders and investment managers have signed a letter vowing to sell off all of their Russian investments, and are calling on others investors to do the same.
The open letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Deputy PM Chrystia Freeland, and Minister of Foreign Affairs Melanie Jolie, was written as the deadly toll of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to mount.

6:14 a.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is appealing to Jews around the world to protest Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, in which significant Jewish sites have been hit.
Zelenskyy made the appeal on Wednesday, a day after a Russian missile strike damaged the Babi Yar Holocaust Memorial on the outskirts of Kyiv, where Nazi occupiers killed more than 33,000 Jews over two days in 1941.
Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, said: “I appeal now to all the Jews of the world — don’t you see what is happening? Therefore, it is very important that millions of Jews around the world do not remain silent now.”
Earlier, shelling hit the town of Uman, a significant pilgrimage site for Hasidic Jews.
6:07 a.m.: A Kremlin spokesman says a Russian delegation will be ready on Wednesday evening to resume talks with Ukrainian officials about the war in Ukraine.
Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday that “in the second half of the day, closer to evening, our delegation will be in place to await Ukrainian negotiators.”
There was no immediate word from Ukrainian authorities about their plans.
Asked about the location of the talks Peskov said only: “I won’t announce the place ahead of time.”
Peskov said Putin’s culture adviser Vladimir Medinsky remains the main negotiator for Russia.
The first round of talks on resolving the Russia-Ukraine war were held near the Belarus-Ukraine border last Sunday.
They produced no breakthrough, though the two sides agreed to meet again.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused the Kremlin of trying to force him into concessions by continuing to press its invasion.
6:06 a.m.: The Ukrainian embassy in the United Arab Emirates says the Gulf country is reimposing visa requirements on Ukrainians, in an effort to stop anyone fleeing the war against Russia heading there.
The embassy posted on its Facebook page Wednesday that the suspension went into effect March 1. Any Ukrainian passport holders wanting to visit the United Arab Emirates will now need a visa first.
The energy-rich UAE, which relies on Russian and Ukrainian wheat exports, is home to some 15,000 Ukrainian residents among its roughly 8 million foreign residents and 1 million Emirati citizens. Before the coronavirus pandemic, around a quarter-million Ukrainian tourists visited the UAE.
The UAE, like other Gulf Arab states, does not recognize individuals fleeing war and has not permitted refugees from Syria, Iraq and other wars to seek asylum or seek resettlement.
The UAE, which is home to Abu Dhabi and Dubai, abstained in a U.N. Security Council vote late last week condemning Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
6:06 a.m.: Pope Francis is thanking Poland for opening its borders and homes to Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion.
Francis gave a special shout-out to Poland during his Wednesday general audience. The weekly appointment coincided with Ash Wednesday, which Francis has designated as a day for fasting and prayers for peace in Ukraine.
Speaking to Polish pilgrims, Francis said he was “profoundly grateful” for Poland’s gestures of solidarity.
“You are the first ones who have supported Ukraine opening your borders, your hearts, the doors of your homes to the Ukrainians who are escaping the war,” Francis said. “You are generously offering everything necessary so that they can live in a dignified way despite the dramatic moment.”
6:05 a.m.: Russia claims its military has taken control of the area around Ukraine’s largest nuclear power plant.
That’s according to the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog.
It said Wednesday it had received a letter from Russia saying personnel at the Zaporizhzhia plant continued their “work on providing nuclear safety and monitoring radiation in normal mode of operation.”
The letter added: “The radiation levels remain normal.”
Zaporizhzhia is the largest of Ukraine’s nuclear sites, with six out of the country’s 15 reactors.
Already, Russia has seized control of the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant, scene of the world’s worst nuclear disaster in 1986.
The IAEA says that it has received a request from Ukraine to “provide immediate assistance in co-ordinating activities in relation to the safety” of Chernobyl and other sites.
6:04 a.m.: Turkey’s foreign minister says Russia has withdrawn a request to send four warships to the Black Sea through the Turkish straits.
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Wednesday that Moscow had agreed to a “friendly request” by Turkey, a NATO member.
Turkey — which has been trying to balance its close relations with both Ukraine and Russia — announced this week that it will implement an international convention that allows it to shut down the straits to warships belong to warring countries.
The convention provides an exception for warships returning to Black Sea ports they are registered with.
Cavusoglu said three of the Russian ships were not registered with Black Sea naval bases.
6:03 a.m.: Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez is reversing course, saying his government will also provide offensive military equipment directly to Ukraine.
Those supplies will be in addition to what Spain is already sending through the European Union.
Sánchez told Parliament Wednesday he is changing Spanish policy because other parties were demanding it and because he wanted political unity around the response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Last week, it sent 20 tons of protective military gear and aid to Kyiv.
Spain contributes to NATO contingents in the Baltics and other allies in eastern Europe.
6:03 a.m.: China says one of its citizens was shot and injured while evacuating from Ukraine.
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said the incident occurred on Tuesday while the person was leaving on their own. The Chinese Embassy in Kyiv immediately contacted the person to provide assistance.
Wang told reporters at a daily briefing that the injured person is out of danger. He said the embassy is following the person’s progress and will continue to provide aid.
Details surrounding the shooting are unclear, pointing to the chaotic situation as hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians and thousands of foreigners seek to escape the fighting.
Beijing has refused to criticize the Russian assault or even describe it as an invasion or war, arguing that NATO and the West had failed to properly address Russia’s “legitimate security concerns.”
As fighting erupted last week, the Foreign Ministry advised its citizens to display a Chinese flag on their vehicles when venturing out. Just two days later, it advised them instead to show no signs of Chinese nationality, apparently reflecting concerns over a hardening of anti-China rhetoric online.
In a phone call Monday with his Ukrainian counterpart, Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged Ukraine to fulfil its “international responsibility” in ensuring the safety of Chinese nationals.
6:02 a.m.: Videos circulated online of an apparent attack on the regional police and intelligence headquarters in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. It shows a building with its roof blown off and its top floor on fire.
Pieces of the five-story building are strewn across adjacent streets.
The Ukrainian government’s centre for strategic communications released images Wednesday of strikes hitting Kharkiv, with balls of fire lighting up the city skyline over populated areas.
Kharkiv resident Marina Boreiko described strikes hitting a neighbouring building Tuesday, and her shock at seeing bodies lying in the rubble.
“Today I survived a bombing,” she told The Associated Press, repeatedly choking back tears.
“A Russian plane dropped a bomb on the house next door. My boyfriend and I were at home. We felt a strong whistle, and I realized it was flying toward us. We were in the corridor then, and we felt the explosion from there.”
As dust rose up, she said, “the first thing I heard was children crying. Our neighbours have three children and the only thing I was thinking about in that moment was, ‘God not them, please, only not them.’”
6:01 a.m.: The European Union is stepping up aid for Ukraine and is moving toward granting temporary protection to those fleeing Russia’s invasion.
The EU Commission announced Wednesday it will give temporary residence permits to the refugees and allow them rights to education and work in the 27-nation bloc.
The move still has to be approved by the member states, but they already expressed broad support over the weekend.
EU Commission President Urusla von der Leyen says “all those fleeing Putin’s bombs are welcome in Europe. We will provide protection to those seeking shelter and we will help those looking for a safe way home.”
On Tuesday, she already committed at least half a billion euros of the bloc’s budget to deal with the humanitarian consequences of the war in Ukraine.
6:01 a.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed concern that Russian attacks could threaten holy religious sites and said Russian troops are trying to “erase our history.”
In a speech posted on Facebook, Zelenskyy on Wednesday denounced a Russian strike that hit Holocaust memorial site Babi Yar in Kyiv.
He said: “This is beyond humanity. Such missile strike means that for many Russians our Kyiv is absolute foreign. They know nothing about our capital, about our history. They have orders to erase our history, our country and all of us.”
“What will be next if even Babi Yar (is hit), what other ‘military’ objects, ‘NATO bases’ are threatening Russia? St. Sophia’s Cathedral, Lavra, Andrew’s Church?” he asked, referring to sites in Kyiv held sacred by Ukrainian and Russian Orthodox believers around the world.
Zelenskyy also claimed almost 6,000 Russian soldiers have been killed since the invasion began last Thursday. Russia has not released overall casualty numbers and the figure could not be confirmed.
6 a.m.: Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed Wednesday that Russian aviation disabled the main TV tower in Ukraine’s capital in an airstrike, but said the attack did not hit any residential buildings.
Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov did not address deaths from Tuesday’s strike or damage to the adjacent Babi Yar memorial to Kyiv’s Holocaust victims. He said the attack was aimed at disabling Ukraine’s ability to stage “information attacks.”
Ukraine’s State Service for Emergency Situations said the strikes on the TV tower killed five people and left five more wounded. Ukrainian television stations briefly went down after the strike but were later restored.
Konashenkov also said Russian forces had seized the southern city of Kherson. The claim could not immediately be confirmed.
Russian forces have faced tougher than expected resistance since invading Ukraine from three sides last week.
5:59 a.m.: A firm that tracks cryptocurrency transactions says $33.8 million in the digital currency has been donated to Ukraine’s government and non-governmental organizations there since the start of Russia’s invasion, nearly a third of it on Tuesday.
Chief Scientist Tom Robinson of Elliptic said most donations to date have been in bitcoin and ether. Some people are sending nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, to the Ukrainian government’s ethereum account.
Ukraine issued a plea for contributions on Twitter last week. To date, it has received 30,000 donations, including $5.8 million from Gavin Wood, the British programmer who co-founded ethereum. There have been several other donations of more than $1 million.
Elliptic also warned of scammers tricking unsuspecting cryptocurrency holders wanting to donate to Ukrainian causes.
Elliptic is among firms that help law enforcement track cryptocurrency to combat money laundering.
5:59 a.m.: The Biden administration is working on a “focused tactical strategy” to make certain that cryptocurrency doesn’t become a mechanism that Moscow is able to utilize to avert sanctions, according to a senior administration official.
The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the yet to be announced move, did not detail an exact timeline for when the new steps on cryptocurrency would be unveiled, but said the area is one of several spaces that the Biden administration officials are looking to shore up as it looks to make certain that sanctions on Russia have maximum impact.
The official said past experiences in Iran and Venezuela with sanctions evasion are informing the administration’s efforts. Additional export controls and new sanction targets are also expected to be unveiled in the days and weeks ahead to counter Russian sanction evasion efforts, the official said.
Officials have already been on the lookout for the use and creation of front companies and alternative financial institutions that Moscow might try to employ to get around sanctions.
5:58 a.m.: Sony is donating $2 million as humanitarian aid to Ukraine though the United Nations Refugee Agency and aid group Save the Children.
The Japanese electronics and entertainment company has already said it will halt theatrical releases in Russia. Upcoming films include Morbius, starring the Marvel Comics hero.
“Our thoughts and prayers are with all those who have been impacted and hope this crisis will be resolved quickly,” Sony Pictures said in a statement.
Earlier this week, Mickey Mikitani, chief executive of Japanese online retailer Rakuten, donated 1 billion yen ($8.7 million) to the Ukrainian government through the embassy in Japan.
Separately, the Foreign Ministry said the Japanese embassy in Kyiv is closing temporarily, with operations transferred to an office in Lviv, western Ukraine.
5:57 a.m.: Ukraine’s Defense Ministry says it has evidence that Belarus, a Russian ally, is preparing to send troops into Ukraine.
The ministry statement, posted on Facebook at midnight, said the Belarusian troops have been brought into combat readiness and are concentrated close to Ukraine’s northern border.
“During the past 24 hours, according to intelligence findings, there has been significant aircraft activity. In addition, there has been movement of a column of vehicles with food and ammunition” approaching the border,” the statement said.
5:57 a.m.: ExxonMobil says it will not invest in new developments in Russia because of Russian military attacks on Ukraine.
The company said in a statement it supports the people of Ukraine as they seek to “defend their freedom and determine their own future as a nation.”
ExxonMobil operates the Sakhalin-1 project on behalf of an international consortium of Japanese, Indian and Russian companies. The company says that in response to recent events, they are beginning the process to discontinue operations and developing steps to exit the Sakhalin-1 venture.
5:56 a.m.: A Russian airstrike hit a residential area near a hospital late Tuesday in Zhytomyr, a city about 85 miles (140 kilometres) west of Ukraine’s capital, Mayor Serih Sukhomlin said in a Facebook video.
Ukraine’s emergency services said the strike killed at least two people, set three homes on fire and broke the windows in the hospital.
Zhytomyr is the home of the elite 95th Air Assault Brigade, which may have been the intended target.
Wednesday 5:55 a.m.: United Airlines said Wednesday it has stopped using Russian airspace for flights between the U.S. and Mumbai and Delhi in India.
An airline spokesperson called the move “temporary,” but gave no further details.
American Airlines has avoided Russian airspace for flights between Delhi and New York by flying south of Russia.

Full text: More carbon-free energy produced by new reactors
Nuclear the answer to our climate crisis, Feb. 19
David Olive's wide-ranging column on nuclear energy and climate-change mitigation only nibbles at the potential offered by some of the new small modular reactors (SMRs), particularly omitting their capability of recycling used nuclear fuel.
Unbeknownst to most people, all current thermal reactors, including Canada's CANDUs, use less than one per cent of their uranium fuel, with the remainder stockpiled as highly radioactive "waste.
Specific SMRs, fast-neutron SMRs, can recycle the other 99 per cent, producing over 100 times more carbon-free energy from the same fuel while consuming and eliminating the million-year radiotoxic fuel components of the "waste" in decades.
This approach provides about $2 billion noncarbon electricity, plus heat, for every single tonne of our current 60,000 tonne stockpile of CANDU nuclear fuel "waste," for an eventual total of $120 trillion.
It would deliver centuries of energy security, energy sovereignty, and climate mitigation with already-stored, homegrown, Canadian-used uranium fuel "waste."

Give rebates to schools, hospitals to mitigate cuts
Ford promises rebates for plate renewals, Feb. 23
With the impending licence-renewal rebates coming and the likely resulting cuts to health care and education in Ontario, I'd suggest that anyone, who can afford it, donate their rebates to their local hospital or buy supplies for a local school.

Was having large council really
a good idea?
Ford's opposition should vow to restore city council, Feb. 26
Sean Micallef makes the suggestion that the opposition parties should have an election plank to restore Toronto to 44 or 47 councillors.
Although I'm not totally opposed to having more than the current 25 councillors, I would suggest that what was really wrong with Doug Ford's decision in 2018 was the fact that he made the change without discussion and in the middle of an election campaign.
If a change is necessary, it should only occur after there has been a deep discussion of what the role of councillors should be and whether there are other and better systems.

Making content that appeals to
so few in Canada
What is Cancon in the internet age?, Feb. 26
Navneet Alang's support for "funding Canadian stories made by Canadians for Canadians" sounds positive, but I find the implications disturbing.
When we create stories, should we really be forced to justify to the CRTC that they are Canadian enough?
And when the Canadian content appeals to so few in Canada, what does it even mean to say that it is "for Canadians?"

Putin has money; leave Russian vodka alone
LCBO told to pull Russian booze, Feb. 26
It seems a little hasty to be pulling Russian products from the LCBO shelves.
The only people it hurts are the vodka-lovers and the taxpayers of Ontario.
Putin already has his money. I would suggest we leave the products on the shelf, sell it and use the profits to send aid to Ukraine. Just don't buy anymore to refill the shelves!
Beats having the product we already own collecting dust in some warehouse.

Full text: In late 1990, I was part of a group of Canadians recruited by a professor from McMaster University and funded by Canada’s department of External Affairs to go to the recently independent country of Ukraine to teach political operatives about political parties in a democracy. The curriculum included fundraising, community organization. advertising. media relations, E-day organization, strategy, etc.
The Berlin Wall had fallen one year earlier on Nov. 9, 1989 and the thirst for freedom shone brightly in our Ukraine classroom. Approximately 150 individuals, representing 30 or 40 political parties, showed up to attend two weeks of lectures from our group.
Howard Aster, a political science professor from McMaster, recruited a multi-party group of instructors including, as I recall, Jim Coutts and Martin Goldfarb from the Liberals, myself and others from the PC Party and several from the NDP and a variety of advertising and media buy companies. We represented political parties from across the political spectrum — from the Green Party to the Communist Party of Ukraine.
There were some unusual aspects to the logistics to our trip. Aster had to bring a huge crate of toilet paper from Toronto because that was not available in Kyiv. Once that basic comfort was provided for, I remember sleeping on a wooden bunk bed with a thin mattress in the building that a year earlier had been the Communist Party headquarters. It was quite surreal.
I came away from that experience with a positive feeling about the future prospect for democracy in Ukraine. The people we met were eager and thirsty for freedom and it seemed to me prepared to work hard to achieve that end.
It reinforced my only other experience with Ukraine politics. In 1988, I learned of the hard work and courage shown by a young Torontonian of Ukrainian descent, Borys Wrzesnewskyj, who drove a crate containing a printing press and three million pieces of paper in a transport truck from St. Petersburg in Russia to Kyiv and then prepared political pamphlets urging the breakup of the U.S.S.R. and freedom for the people of Ukraine. (Wrzesnewskyj later became a Liberal MP for Etobicoke Centre). The address on the crate was Shakespeare-Kyiv.
I have seen many media clips describing the courage of Ukraine leadership and its citizens in these early days of Putin’s violent assault on their country. The words of Ukranian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy — “I don’t need a ride, I need ammunition” — will be etched in the history books alongside those of Winston Churchill when people google the words “political courage.”
The events of this week pose a serious threat to democracy and freedom in Ukraine. However, the strong resolve, defiance and courage exhibited thus far suggest that it may take more than Putin counted on to extinguish the thirst for freedom in Kyiv — and Zelenskyy, the comedian turned politician, may have the last laugh.
John Laschinger is a veteran political organizer best known for organizing election campaigns and party leadership bids for a variety of candidates.

Full text: Let the campaign begin.
An imminent deal with Ottawa on $10-a-day child care, a good-news budget put off until the eve of the election, and a bevy of big-spending announcements as the COVID-19 pandemic appears to be winding down.
With Ontario voters headed to the polls in just three months, Premier Doug Ford is hitting the hustings and revving up the rhetoric.
“On June 2, people are going to have a choice,” Ford told reporters Monday at a campaign-style announcement on improving wages and working conditions for gig employees .
“Either (they) want to move forward with making sure that we build roads and bridges and hospitals and schools, putting money back into people’s pockets, have the economy going,” the premier said, before taking a shot at the Liberal government of former premiers Kathleen Wynne and Dalton McGuinty.
“Or do you want to go back 15 years of the previous government that lost 300,000 jobs in this province, highest hydro rates, red tape and regulations. It was an absolute disaster under the previous government. So people will have a choice.”
Beyond the partisan talking points, the Progressive Conservative premier stressed an agreement with the federal Liberal government to deliver $10-a-day child care “is very, very close.”
“That’s all I can tell you. It’s going to get done as sure as we’re standing here, but as I said, I’m not going to do a deal just for making a deal,” he said.
A senior provincial government official, speaking confidentially in order to discuss the negotiations, said that an accord will be inked well before the June 2 election.
NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said it is “a shame” that Ontario is the only province to not yet sign on.
“It’s just not a priority for Doug Ford,” said Horwath.
“Meanwhile, people were actually getting cheques in other provinces to rebate the amount of child care that they have paid for between June and the end of the year,” she said.
Time is of the essence, because Ontario risks missing out a year’s worth of funding if it waits until Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland’s federal budget, which is expected in the spring.
In the legislature, Wynne, the Liberal MPP for Don Valley West, said “every other (provincial and territorial) government has managed to reach a deal before the end of the fiscal year on March 31 so that they could receive the money earmarked for this year.”
Last week, Ford amended his own law to move the provincial budget deadline to April 30 from March 31.
That means the budget, which will serve as the Tories’ re-election platform, can be delivered days before the official start of the campaign in May.
“I can’t say we did it just because of that,” the premier insisted of the new Fewer Fees, Better Services Act, which also eliminated licence plate sticker renewal fees of up to $120 annually, which will cost $1 billion a year, and removed tolls from Durham’s Highways 412 and 418.
Changing the law he introduced in 2019 means Ford and Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy won’t face financial penalties of 10 per cent of their cabinet top-up pay for not meeting a March 31 deadline.
“I paid $10,000 back into the government when we didn’t meet the budget time frame before — and so did the previous finance minister (Rod Phillips),” he noted, referring to the $9,200 and $4,900 they repaid the treasury because the pandemic delayed the 2020 budget.
With proof-of-vaccination passports being phased out as of Tuesday — under the advice of Dr. Kieran Moore, the chief medical officer of health — Ford was asked when mask mandates would be lifted.
“I’m listening to the chief medical officer. It’s his advice when they’re going to come off and we’ll wait for his advice and recommendations,” he said, referring to Moore’s comments two weeks ago that mask changes could come later in March.
“Over the next few weeks, maybe after March break, when kids get back, but we’ll see. I don’t want to set a date. There isn’t a person I talk to likes these masks. No one likes them. But I’m going to follow the advice and we aren’t far away.”

Province eliminates double fares for local trips connecting to GO Transit - except for the TTC

Full text: The province is making public transportation more affordable by eliminating double fares for trips that connect to GO Transit on most local services across the Greater Golden Horseshoe.
But while the policy, which goes into effect March 14, will give riders in places like Brampton, Mississauga and Hamilton a break, it won’t apply to TTC customers in Toronto.
Associate Transportation Minister Stan Cho announced the policy Tuesday morning at a bus garage in Mississauga.
He said that in addition to the Ontario PC government’s recent decisions to eliminate tolls on Highways 412 and 418 in Durham and scrap licence plate sticker renewal fees for drivers, cutting transit fares is another way the province is making it more affordable for Ontarians struggling with rising costs to get around.
“Since Day One our government has been making it easier for people to get from Point A to Point B,” he said, noting that under Premier Doug Ford the province is investing billions in new public transit lines.
“We know that effective transit infrastructure means more than just laying subway track. It must be accessible and that’s why today we’re cutting the cost of taking transit,” Cho said.
The province’s announcement means trips connecting to GO Transit will be free on Durham Region Transit, Milton Transit, Grand River Transit, Guelph Transit, Oakville Transit, MiWay, Brampton Transit, Hamilton Street Railway, Burlington Transit, Bradford West Gwillimbury Transit, York Region Transit and Barrie Transit. Riders on those services will still have to pay the GO fare.
The province estimates a Mississauga resident who commutes three days a week using MiWay and GO would save about $250 a year as a result of the new policy.
The government didn’t immediately provide details of how much eliminating the fares will cost the province.
In 2020, the Ontario PC government pulled the plug on a popular program introduced by the previous Liberal government that provided discounts of $1.50 for riders transferring between the TTC and GO or the UP Express. The discounted double fare, which cost more than $18 million a year, was pitched by the Liberals as a crucial step in regional fare integration, but the Ontario PCs let its funding expire.
Cho didn’t rule out extending the new discount policy to the TTC, which is by far the largest local transit agency in the region, at some point in the future.
“A project of this size and the changes we’re making do take a little bit of time, so the discussions with the TTC will be ongoing. The ultimate goal is to make sure we connect the entire grid,” he said.
Ontario Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca, who was transportation minister when the province introduced the TTC-GO discounted double fare in 2018, said Ford’s decision to scrap it was “reckless.”
He called Tuesday’s announcement a transparent attempt to win votes ahead of the June 2 provincial election.
With just over three months until the election “suddenly Doug Ford has seen the light and has decided that he has to make transit more affordable,” Del Duca said.
“I think people can see that for what it is. It’s electioneering. It’s trying to convince people to not remember the brutal mistakes that Doug Ford has made consistently over the past four years.”
The province also announced Tuesday it will almost double the fare discounts for youth and post-secondary students, who will now receive 40 per cent off the adult price on GO and UP Express. The discount applies to riders between 13 and 19 years of age.
The province is also launching an affordability pilot for low-income GO riders, starting with residents of Peel Region who are already enrolled in that municipality’s Affordable Transit Program. Eligible riders will be reimbursed 50 per cent of an adult fare when riding GO using a Presto card. The government says it will roll out the pilot to other local transit agencies in a phased approach.

Full text: Imagine hopping a train from Coca-Cola Exhibition to Tim Hortons Oakville. Or hitching a ride from Scotiabank Whitby to Shoppers Drug Mart Clarkson.
The map of the GO Transit network could soon look a little different, as Metrolinx moves ahead with plans to sell the naming rights for stops on the regional rail service.
In February, the agency issued a request for expressions of interest for a "station naming rights opportunity" at four rail stops - Whitby, Exhibition, Clarkson and Oakville.
The organization says it chose the four stations based on a combination of high ridership and strategic location, but the solicitation, which was posted to Metrolinx's procurement website on Feb. 15, says the agency "will consider proposals for other stations at the request of interested parties."
Metrolinx, the Ontario Crown corporation that oversees GO and the Union-Pearson Express, first proposed selling the rights to name stations in 2019. In a statement attributed to a Metrolinx spokesperson, the agency said the most recent posting is a continuation of that original effort and "part of a strategy to enhance transit and the customer experience by generating new forms of non-fare revenue."
The organization has previously estimated that letting companies put their names on train stations could generate up to $500,000 per station per year. Although it has yet to announce any naming deals, it says there has been ample interest from potential sponsors.
"We are particularly encouraged by these new revenue opportunities as we start to recover from the effects of the pandemic on our ridership," it said.
The agency believes riders won't be confused by any changes to station names because the branded stops would retain their current titles, with the sponsor's name added in front.
No specific types of companies - liquor or cannabis brands, for instance - would be prohibited from making offers for naming rights, but it would be up to Metrolinx whether to negotiate a deal.
A request for information that Metrolinx posted in 2019 listed a fifth station, Pickering, that isn't included in the new solicitation. The 2019 request closed in October 2021. Metrolinx wouldn't say why Pickering has been left out of the new request.
When the Star asked Ontario Transportation Minister Caroline Mulroney for comment on the station rights issue Friday, her spokesperson sent a statement nearly identical to the one provided by Metrolinx, an ostensibly arm's-length agency of the province, with the words "provincial government" exchanged for "Metrolinx."
Mulroney has previously shown support for the naming rights plan, saying in 2019 that it aligned with the Ontario PC government's vision of ensuring the province is "open for business."
On Friday, Ontario Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner criticized the idea of selling the naming rights for publicly funded transit stops, arguing that "governments shouldn't be in the business of supporting corporate interests like this."
"If the Ford government wants to raise funds, they should cancel the $10-billion climate disaster Highway 413 and the $1-billion licence sticker election gimmick and invest those funds towards affordable and accessible transit instead," he said.
Since Metrolinx first proposed selling station rights, COVID-19 has caused a dramatic drop in ridership on transit networks all over the world. Ridership on GO is now at about 24 per cent of pre-pandemic levels, while volumes on the UP Express are at 30 per cent. Fewer people riding could theoretically make the naming rights for stations less attractive to potential sponsors.
However, before the Omicron wave hit last year, ridership had rebounded to about 50 per cent of normal, and Metrolinx is confident ridership will return to normal over the next one to two years.
The organization expects opportunities for private sector partnerships to ramp up as it pursues strategies like transit-oriented development, in which companies agree to build transit infrastructure in exchange for benefits like development rights near the lines.
The request for expressions of interest for naming rights closes at the end of 2022.

Full text: Let the campaign begin.
An imminent deal with Ottawa on $10-a-day child care, a good-news budget put off until the eve of the election and a bevy of big-spending announcements as the COVID-19 pandemic appears to be winding down.
With Ontario voters headed to the polls in just three months, Premier Doug Ford is hitting the hustings and revving up the rhetoric.
"On June 2, people are going to have a choice," Ford told reporters Monday at a campaign-style announcement on improving wages and working conditions for gig employees.
"Either (they) want to move forward with making sure that we build roads and bridges and hospitals and schools, putting money back into people's pockets, have the economy going," the premier said, before taking a shot at the Liberal government of former premiers Kathleen Wynne and Dalton McGuinty.
"Or do you want to go back 15 years of the previous government that lost 300,000 jobs in this province, highest hydro rates, red tape and regulations. It was an absolute disaster under the previous government. So people will have a choice."
Beyond the partisan talking points, the Progressive Conservative premier stressed an agreement with the federal Liberal government to deliver $10-a-day child care "is very, very close."
"That's all I can tell you. It's going to get done as sure as we're standing here, but as I said, I'm not going to do a deal just for making a deal," he said.
A senior provincial government official, speaking confidentially in order to discuss the negotiations, said that an accord will be inked well before the June 2 election.
NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said it is "a shame" that Ontario is the only province to not yet sign on.
"It's just not a priority for Doug Ford," Horwath said.
"Meanwhile, people were actually getting cheques in other provinces to rebate the amount of child care that they have paid for between June and the end of the year," she said.
Time is of the essence, because Ontario risks missing out on a year's worth of funding if it waits until Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland's federal budget, which is expected in the spring.
In the legislature, Wynne, the Liberal MPP for Don Valley West, said "every other (provincial and territorial) government has managed to reach a deal before the end of the fiscal year on March 31 so that they could receive the money earmarked for this year."
Last week, Ford amended his own law to move the provincial budget deadline to April 30 from March 31.
That means the budget, which will serve as the Tories' re-election platform, can be delivered days before the official start of the campaign in May.
"I can't say we did it just because of that," the premier insisted of the new Fewer Fees, Better Services Act, which also eliminated licence plate sticker renewal fees of up to $120 annually, which will cost $1 billion a year, and removed tolls from Durham's Highways 412 and 418.
Changing the law he introduced in 2019 means Ford and Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy won't face financial penalties of 10 per cent of their cabinet top-up pay for not meeting a March 31 deadline.
"I paid $10,000 back into the government when we didn't meet the budget time frame before - and so did the previous finance minister (Rod Phillips)," he noted, referring to the $9,200 and $4,900 they repaid the treasury because the pandemic delayed the 2020 budget.

Full text: Ford cares little about schools, health care
A billion for re-election, Feb. 10
Let's face the fact that Doug Ford wants to be remembered as the man who put a $1-billion hole in the Ontario budget.
In Ford's Ontario, funding for education and health care are already near the lowest, per capita, in Canada.
One billion dollars of decreased funding will result in a decreased number of staff in our medical system.
Our children will be crowded into even fewer classrooms, and post-secondary education funding will still be ranked as the lowest in Canada.
Reducing the income of our provincial government by $1 billion will not result in better outcomes in our health or educational systems. It will make a name for Ford: the Billion-dollar Man.
Allan Baker, Scarborough
Patients, nurses need help of Ontario's IENs
This initiative is opening doors for hundreds of Ontario's internationally educated nurses, Feb. 13
Chandra Kafle's story is an important reminder that Ontario must recognize the experience of internationally educated nurses (IEN).
There are over 22,000 IENs living in Ontario who are eager to nurse. Their expertise is desperately needed.
It is imperative that the College of Nurses of Ontario (CNO) expedite applications so IENs are not waiting on the sidelines.
Ontario is in the midst of a nursing crisis and expediting the processing of applications is one key solution. It is great to see hospitals such as Sunnybrook supporting IENs.
Nurses on the front lines are exhausted. Patients are suffering. Wait times for procedures and surgeries are catastrophic. Residents in long-term-care homes need more nursing care.
We must enable that all IENs, who are eagerly waiting, can join the nursing workforce more quickly.
Doris Grinspun, Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO)
What other sites did Metrolinx examine, reject?
Secretive Metrolinx has it backward, Feb. 24
I am curious to know what other sites Metrolinx examined and rejected, and why?
For example, it would be feasible to expand the railway corridor and lay extra tracks between Dawes and Victoria Park using existing land and expropriating open space from the Shoppers World retail plaza, just east of the Danforth GO station.
Our governments have a history of taking the valuable parklands and ravines and using them for new projects instead of expropriating private property; it is cheaper, perhaps, but, as a result, the Don Valley is a mess criss-crossed by highways and railways and utility corridors with most of its recreational value lost or compromised.

Palestinians are wrongly accused of antisemitism
Letter, Presenting three sentences that teach us about antisemitism, Feb. 24
Anti-Zionism is not antisemitism.
Zionists originally claimed that Israel was a "land with no people for a people with no land," but this was not true.
There were lots of Palestinians there.
So now the Zionists claim to be a "liberation movement."
But they are "liberating" the land from Palestinians who had nothing to with oppressing Jews.
Palestinians, quite rightly, are resisting the Jews' "self-determination" at their expense, and, for this, they are wrongly accused of antisemitism.

Next stop - Tim Hortons Oakville? Metrolinx on track to sell off naming rights to GO stations

Full text: Imagine hopping a train from Coca-Cola Exhibition to Tim Hortons Oakville. Or hitching a ride from Scotiabank Whitby to Shoppers Drug Mart Clarkson.
The map of the GO Transit network could soon look a little different, as Metrolinx moves ahead with plans to sell the naming rights for stops on the regional rail service.
In February, the agency issued a request for expressions of interest for a “station naming rights opportunity” at four rail stops — Whitby, Exhibition, Clarkson and Oakville.
The organization says it chose the four stations based on a combination of high ridership and strategic location, but the solicitation, which was posted to Metrolinx’s procurement website on Feb. 15, says the agency “will consider proposals for other stations at the request of interested parties.”
Metrolinx, which is the Ontario Crown corporation that oversees GO and the UP Express, first proposed selling the rights to name stations in 2019 . In a statement attributed to a Metrolinx spokesperson, the agency said the most recent posting is a continuation of that original effort and “part of a strategy to enhance transit and the customer experience by generating new forms of non-fare revenue.”
The organization has previously estimated that letting companies put their names on train stations could generate up to $500,000 per station per year. Although it has yet to announce any naming deals, it says there has been ample interest from potential sponsors.
“We are particularly encouraged by these new revenue opportunities as we start to recover from the effects of the pandemic on our ridership,” it said.
The agency believes riders won’t be confused by any changes to station names because the branded stops would retain their current titles, just with the sponsor’s name added in front.
No specific types of companies — liquor or cannabis brands for instance — would be prohibited from making offers for naming rights, but it would be up to Metrolinx whether to negotiate a deal.

Full text: A billion for re-election, Feb. 10
Let’s face the fact that Doug Ford wants to be remembered as the man who put a $1-billion hole in the Ontario budget.
In Ford’s Ontario, funding for education and health care are already near the lowest, per capita, in Canada.
One billion dollars of decreased funding will result in a decreased number of staff in our medical system.
Our children will be crowded into even fewer classrooms, and post-secondary education funding will still be ranked as the lowest in Canada.
Reducing the income of our provincial government by $1 billion will not result in better outcomes in our health or educational systems. It will make a name for Ford: the Billion Dollar Man.
Allan Baker, Scarborough, Ont.
This initiative is opening doors for hundreds of Ontario’s internationally educated nurses, Feb. 13
Chandra Kafle’s story is an important reminder that Ontario must recognize the experience of internationally educated nurses (IEN).
There are over 22,000 IENs living in Ontario who are eager to nurse. Their expertise is desperately needed.
It is imperative that the College of Nurses of Ontario (CNO) expedite applications so IENs are not waiting on the sidelines.
Ontario is in the midst of a nursing crisis and expediting the processing of applications is one key solution. It is great to see hospitals such as Sunnybrook supporting IENs.
Nurses on the front lines are exhausted. Patients are suffering. Wait times for procedures and surgeries are catastrophic. Residents in long-term-care homes need more nursing care.
We must enable that all IENs, who are eagerly waiting, can join the nursing workforce more quickly.
Doris Grinspun, RN, O. ONT, Registered Nurses’ Association of Ontario (RNAO)
Secretive Metrolinx has it backward, Feb. 24
I am curious to know what other sites Metrolinx examined and rejected, and why?
For example, it would be feasible to expand the railway corridor and lay extra tracks between Dawes and Victoria Park using existing land and expropriating open space from the Shoppers World retail plaza, just east of the Danforth GO station.
Our governments have a history of taking the valuable parklands and ravines and using them for new projects instead of expropriating private property; it is cheaper, perhaps, but, as a result, the Don Valley is a mess criss-crossed by highways and railways and utility corridors with most of its recreational value lost or compromised.
Brian Graff, Toronto
Letter, Presenting three sentences that teach us about antisemitism, Feb. 24
Anti-Zionism is not antisemitism.
Zionists originally claimed that Israel was a “land with no people for a people with no land,” but this was not true.
There were lots of Palestinians there.
So now the Zionists claim to be a “liberation movement.”
But they are “liberating” the land from Palestinians who had nothing to with oppressing Jews.
Palestinians, quite rightly, are resisting the Jews’ “self-determination” at their expense, and, for this, they are wrongly accused of antisemitism.
Wolfe Erlichman, Godfrey, Ont.

Full text: The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Monday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available .
7:20 p.m. British Columbia says another 22 deaths linked to COVID-19 were recorded over a three-day period, bringing the death toll to 2,873.
A statement from the Health Ministry says the number of people in hospitals due to COVID-19 declined again with 549 patients in hospital as of Monday, a drop from 599 on Friday.
Of those in hospital, it says 85 were in intensive care.
The province also reported 974 new cases of COVID-19 over the three-day period ending Monday, although health officials have said the number is likely higher due to testing capacity limits.
4:41 p.m. Health officials in Prince Edward Island reported one more death related to COVID-19 on Monday.
Officials say the death involves a resident 80 years old or older.
A total of 16 people have died on the Island as a result of the disease.
Officials also reported 933 new infections since their last update on Friday.
There are six people in hospital with COVID-19, including four admitted because of the disease and two patients who tested positive for COVID-19 after being admitted for other medical reasons.
Officials say there has been an average of 314 new infections per day over the last seven days.
2:40 p.m. A group of Canadian Rangers will be helping an Ontario First Nation as it battles a COVID-19 outbreak.
The Canadian Armed Forces say about eight rangers will be providing food, water and care packages to Kasabonika Lake First Nation, located roughly 450 kilometres northeast of Sioux Lookout, Ont.
They say the rangers will also help with transportation and distributing COVID-19 information in the community. The support will be in place until March 10, but can be extended upon request.
In a tweet, Public Safety Minister Bill Blair says the rangers were “activated” after a request for assistance from the Ontario government.
2:39 p.m. Three more people have died as a result of COVID-19 in New Brunswick.
The latest deaths involve a person over the age of 90 in the Bathurst region, one person in their 70s in the Moncton area and someone also in their 70s in the Edmundston region.
There have been 304 COVID-19-related deaths in New Brunswick since the start of the pandemic.
There are 89 people in hospital with the disease — an increase of 17 since Friday — including three people in intensive care.
2:35 p.m. The end of mask mandates in Ontario is “not far away,” and could come as early as after March Break, Premier Doug Ford said Monday.
Ontario’s COVID-19 vaccine certificate system is set to end Tuesday, and all remaining capacity limits for indoor public settings will be lifted as well, but Ford has said mask rules would be in place for “just a little bit longer.”
Ford said he will wait for the recommendation of the chief medical officer of health, Dr. Kieran Moore, who said a few days ago that he would have an update in the coming weeks.
“What I’m hearing over the next few weeks, maybe after March Break when kids get back, but we’ll see. I don’t want to set a date,” Ford said at a news conference on Monday.
“We aren’t far away.”
2:07 p.m. With one small jab, Eugena Bryan made history.
It was Dec. 31, 2020 and COVID-19 had already ravaged long-term-care facilities across the province as it swiftly infected residents and care staff, leaving thousands dead in its wake. This vulnerable group had become a top priority for vaccination.
Bryan, a registered nurse who was involved in COVID-19 testing, and her colleagues at the Toronto Western Family Health Team, were asked if they wanted to help administer shots at the beginning of the vaccine rollout. They jumped at the chance and were dispatched to a Toronto long-term-care home.
“It was really devastating what was happening in long-term care … So, we made a pledge to help as much as we could,” said Bryan.

2 p.m. New Zealand is ending a requirement that incoming travellers isolate themselves as it continues to remove coronavirus border protections in the face of a growing domestic outbreak.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Monday said the requirement that vaccinated travelers isolate for a week after arriving would end on Wednesday. Initially the changes will apply only to returning New Zealanders, as tourists are still not allowed to visit.
Travelers will still need to test negative for the virus before leaving and after arriving.
The changes were welcomed by the tourism industry, although leaders wanted more certainty over when tourists could return. International tourism used to account for about 20% of New Zealand’s foreign income but has evaporated since the pandemic began.
12:45 p.m. Saskatchewan lifted its remaining COVID-19 restrictions today — the first province in Canada to do so.
Residents no longer have to wear masks in indoor public places and are not required to self-isolate for five days if they test positive for the virus.
Saskatchewan ditched its vaccine passport on February 14th.
12:40 p.m. Eased border restrictions came into effect this morning, lifting the requirement for fully vaccinated travellers to take a pre-departure COVID-19 molecular test.
The federal government announced earlier this month that double-vaccinated air and land travellers no longer need to present a negative molecular test result, such as a PCR test before departure for Canada.
Unvaccinated children under 12 also no longer need to self-isolate upon return to the country, and Ottawa has lifted its blanket advisory against trips abroad.
Potentially cheaper and easier-to-access rapid antigen tests administered by a health professional remain mandatory for Canadians 12 and over who want to avoid quarantining at home for 10 days upon return to the country.
12:15 p.m. Quebec is reporting seven more deaths linked to the novel coronavirus today and a drop of 10 COVID-19 hospitalizations.
The Health Department says 1,446 patients are in hospital with the disease, after 59 people were admitted in the last 24 hours and 69 were discharged.
Officials say the number of people in intensive care declined by four, to 94.
Authorities are reporting 845 new cases detected through PCR testing, which is reserved for certain high-risk groups.
11:49 a.m. Patti LuPone won’t be lunching for the foreseeable future.
The Broadway icon announced Sunday that she has tested positive for COVID-19 and will miss more than a week of shows of “Company” on the Broadway stage.
“Hi Dolls. I showed up for Saturday’s matinee, tested positive for Covid with 3 tests,” the 72-year-old singer tweeted. “Unfortunately, I’ll be out of the show for 10 days. I’m so sorry.”
11:43 a.m. Some establishments in Ontario will maintain proof-of-vaccine requirements even after the province ends its vaccine certificate system on Tuesday, saying they want to ensure that people feel safe and comfortable coming through their doors.
Jan Campbell-Luxton, owner of De La Terre Bakery + Café in St. Catharines, Ont., said he and front-of-house staff came to a joint decision to keep checking for proof of vaccination against COVID-19.
Maintaining the policy feels like “a fairly small price” to pay to ensure both staff and customers feel safe, he said.
“We felt like at the moment, it seemed a bit premature to simply abolish the vaccine requirements and just throw everything open,” said Campbell-Luxton. “We’re certainly not interested in kicking people out, so just as it is today, after March 1, if you’re unvaccinated and want to get something to go, you just have to wear a mask and we also do curbside pickup.”
Campbell-Luxton noted the business will also keep a capacity limit of 50 per cent for the time being, despite the province lifting capacity limits in all remaining indoor public settings as of Tuesday as well.
10:47 a.m. Omicron is fading away, and so are Americans’ worries about COVID-19.
As coronavirus pandemic case numbers, hospitalizations and deaths continue to plummet, fewer people now than in January say they are concerned that they will be infected after the rise and fall of the wildly contagious virus variant, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
Just 24% say they are “extremely” or “very” worried about themselves or a family member contracting COVID-19, down from 36% in both December and January, when Omicron caused a massive spike in infections and taxed public health systems. Another 34% say they are somewhat worried. More than 140,000 deaths in the U.S. have been attributed to COVID-19 since omicron became the dominant strain of the coronavirus in mid-December.
10:17 a.m. (updated): Ontario is reporting 279 people in ICU due to COVID-19 and 849 in hospital overall testing positive for COVID-19, according to its latest report released Monday morning.
The numbers represent a less than a one per cent decrease in the ICU COVID-19 count and a one per cent increase in hospitalizations overall. 28.7 per cent of the province’s 2,343 adult ICU beds remain available for new patients.
Given new provincial regulations around testing that took effect Dec. 31, 2021, case counts — reported at 1,315 on Monday, down 34.3 per cent from the previous day — are also not considered an accurate assessment of how widespread COVID-19 is right now. Three new deaths were reported in the latest numbers.
Not all hospitals report data to the province early in the week.

9:15 a.m. A group of congressional Republicans has drafted legislation designed to force the Biden administration to abandon COVID-19 travel restrictions at the Canada-U.S. border.
New York Rep. Chris Jacobs hosted a news conference Sunday to unveil what he’s calling the Northern Border Reopening Act.
Canadian visitors would no longer need to be vaccinated to enter the U.S. or, in the case of air travel, show proof of a negative COVID-19 test, in the unlikely event the bill were to become law.
Democrats currently have control of the House of Representatives and hold the tiebreaker vote in the 50-50 Senate, although that’s expected to change after the November midterms.
The bill is co-sponsored by several House Republicans whose opposition to travel restrictions are well known, including fellow New Yorkers Elise Stefanik and Lee Zeldin, as well as Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber.
8:53 a.m . Life is getting a little more back to normal today in Quebec. Bars and casinos can operate at half capacity and the province is ending its COVID-19 mandatory teleworking order on Monday. Cinemas, theatres, places of worship and sports arenas holding fewer than 10-thousand people can operate at full capacity.
8:33 a.m. For two years, Ontarians were told to keep at least six feet apart from others, wear a mask in public spaces, get vaccinated and wash their hands vigorously to protect themselves and loved ones from catching COVID-19 .
But as the latest Omicron wave dips, the province is now making the boldest moves toward reopening yet. On March 1, all vaccine mandates in Ontario will be lifted, meaning people no longer have to provide proof of vaccination to eat at a restaurant or watch a movie. Later in the month, Ontario’s top doctors hinted at a review of mask mandates, which have been in place since May 2020.
By and large, many governments are signalling a transition toward a post-pandemic life. But experts in psychology say people’s views on reopening will vary widely, based on both their lived experience and their attitude toward risky behaviours. Some have developed a stress response to the possibility of exposure to the virus, while others have tuned out any fears related to COVID-19.

8:22 a.m. Japan this week will ease tough coronavirus border controls that have been criticized as xenophobic and damaging to the economy. The new rules, however, provide only a slight improvement: 5,000 new entrants per day, instead of the current 3,500, and nowhere near the estimated 64,000 a day that were entering for long-term visits before the pandemic.
The 5,000 daily arrivals also includes Japanese nationals returning to the country, which means hundreds of thousands of foreigners will still struggle to enter.
An estimated half million foreign students, teachers, workers accredited as technical interns and business travelers have been locked out and waiting to get in for nearly two years. Under the policy that takes effect Tuesday, it would take several more months of patience before everyone can get in.
8:15 a.m. South Korea will no longer require people to show proof of vaccination or negative tests to enter any indoor space starting Tuesday, removing a key preventive measure during a fast-developing omicron surge that’s elevating hospitalizations and deaths.
The Health Ministry’s announcement on Monday came as the country set another one-day record in COVID-19 deaths with 114, breaking the previous high of 112 set on Saturday. More than 710 COVID-19 patients were in critical or serious conditions, up from 200-300 in mid-February, while nearly half of the country’s intensive care units designated for COVID-19 were occupied.
Park Hyang, a senior health ministry official, said rescinding the “anti-epidemic pass” would free more health workers to help monitor nearly 800,000 virus patients with mild or moderate symptoms who have been asked to isolate at home to save hospital space.
7:10 a.m. New York state’s mandate requiring mask use at schools will end on Wednesday, Gov. Kathy Hochul said.
She cited steep declines in COVID-19 numbers in announcing the move. Cities and counties can keep mask mandates in place as they see fit, she added.
On Friday, New York Mayor Eric Adams announced the end of mandatory mask use in outdoor settings at city schools.
7:05 a.m. The pandemic put the tourism industry in a holding pattern, but some attractions pushed through and planned their debuts despite the uncertainty. Fresh new offerings — including a mind-bender on International Drive and a simulated intergalactic experience — are beginning to blossom in Central Florida.
Worldwide conditions played ever-changing roles in their creations, from supply-chain issues to the fluid public mindset.
“We opened to that unsure crowd that wanted to do … something,” said Marc Gregory Tipton, sales and marketing manager of Museum of Illusions Orlando, which came to Icon Park in January 2021.
But before welcoming visitors, parts of the attraction had to be assembled. The museum features artistic brain teasers, using angles and mirrors to create visual trickery and photo opportunities. But the company, created in Croatia in 2015, was unable to send a setup team to Florida because of travel restrictions.
5:51 a.m.: Dead bodies are piling up on gurneys in hospital hallways as Hong Kong’s health system is overloaded by its biggest COVID-19 outbreak of the pandemic.
Officials said they are struggling to move the dead to the city’s public morgues quickly enough after more than 400 people died from COVID-19 last week, according to the latest official statistics. The news comes as the city is struggling to tamp down on an omicron-fueled outbreak, with more than 26,000 cases and 83 deaths reported Sunday.
The city’s hospital authority blamed transportation delays for the situation. “That is why some bodies that were planned to be transported stayed in the hospital,” said Lau Ka-hin, the chief manager of quality and standards at Hong Kong’s hospital authority.
Monday 5:40 a.m.: Speaking about his government’s decision to lift various public health restrictions ahead of schedule, Premier Doug Ford expressed a popular sentiment about COVID-19 as the pandemic’s second anniversary nears.
“Everyone’s done with this ,” he said on Feb. 15. “Like, we are done with it … Thank God, on March 1 we’re moving out of this, and I just can’t wait.”
Not everyone shares the premier’s enthusiasm, however.
Katie Babcock wishes she could be “done” with COVID and all the disruption it has caused her life, but the 42-year-old marketing and communications professional knows that immunocompromised people like her can’t simply wish their risk away. “I don’t have the privilege not to live in fear,” she said.
Babcock’s life will actually become more constrained on March 1, when the province eliminates proof-of-vaccination requirements and capacity limits, because she will be deepening her isolation in order to protect herself. If masking is no longer required indoors, her world will shrink even further.
The public health measures some see as restrictive and inconvenient, she considers potentially life-saving.

Full text: Action is needed, before it's too late
Cold War-era thinking fuelling Putin's actions , Feb. 25
What no one seems to be mentioning is the similarity between Putin's action in Ukraine and Hitler's actions against Poland in 1939. In fact, Hitler's expansionist policies throughout the 1930s are similar to those of Putin's in the past five or so years.
Hitler was successful because the major powers were preoccupied with the depression and were, to a large extent divided in their actions, with the result that no actions were taken until it was too late.
It would seem Putin is a good student of history, and the arrests in Moscow of dissenters is indicative of the kind of policies associated with totalitarian regimes.
It is absolutely essential Western democracies take firm action now - before history is allowed to repeat itself completely.

Del Duca must step up to plate
Can Del Duca pull off a miracle?, Hepburn, Feb. 24
What an excellent article by Star columnist Bob Hepburn.
I agree completely with his points and I do hope the Liberal strategists will take the advice to heart.
I especially agree Del Duca needs to "show energy, hire an image consultant and highlight the team of candidates" and I would add I hope he will run a positive campaign, emphasizing what he will do as premier as opposed to flooding the airwaves with negative attack ads between now and June 2.
Any citizen who has been observing what has happened in our province during these past four years knows what we need in a leader for the future.
So please, step up to the plate, Steven Del Duca.

Give plate rebates to local hospitals
Ontario vehicle owners will get rebates for licence plate renewal fees, Doug Ford says, Feb. 22
I've been thinking about how to spend Premier Doug Ford's publicly funded attempt at winning the next election via elimination of driver's licence fee.
I've decided to donate that money to our local hospital, where the funds should have gone in the first place.
Julie Pingree, Toronto
Reverse the licence-fee cut, and repurpose these funds to our nurses and ailing health-care system!
I'm confident this would be unanimously supported.
Dr. Darryl Jordan Gebien,
Toronto
I am not for sale. If Premier Doug Ford refunds my licence renewal fee, I will donate it to the candidate most likely to defeat him.
Kate Chung, Toronto
Struggling to provide support
Mental health services dealing with rising calls for help, as staff are leaving, Feb. 21
Thank you for your article highlighting the current challenges within our mental-health system.
Family service agencies are also experiencing difficulties in keeping and recruiting staff and an increase in service demand combined with a decrease in funding.
Family service agencies play a vital role in Ontario's mental-health ecosystem. Individuals, couples and families come to us for a variety of reasons, but often because the services they need do not exist for those without the means to pay for a private therapist.
With years of mandated wage freezes, no funding increases and a decline in charitable dollars, family service agencies have struggled to keep up with competitive salaries. As a result, many agencies are bleeding staff, while the demand for service has doubled.
Those most affected by the pandemic are also our most vulnerable - and the ones left behind in accessing services, because the counsellors are not there to provide it, and the funding is not there to keep them.
As a network, we are committed to work together with our community partners and government to find solutions so no one is left behind.
Susan Wells, chief executive officer, Family Service Ontario

Full text: A billion for re-election, Feb. 10
I am mystified that Doug Ford is removing over a billion dollars from the economy of this province.
Even more, I am outraged by his irresponsible comment that “the worst place to give your money is to the government.”
How exactly is the government expected to provide essential services that the people of this province so desperately need?

Full text: Ford needs to learn government has a purpose
A billion for re-election, Feb. 10
I am mystified that Doug Ford is removing over a billion dollars from the economy of this province.
Even more, I am outraged by his irresponsible comment that "the worst place to give your money is to the government."
How exactly is the government expected to provide essential services that the people of this province so desperately need?
Michael Bines, Thornhill
Antisemitism not hard to sum up
TDSB urged to act against antisemitism, Feb. 23
Is it enough to teach about the Holocaust in the face of antisemitic actions by TDSB students and anti-Zionism at the University of Toronto?
Or do students need to learn that the Holocaust was the worst manifestation of a centuries-long history of continuing antisemitism due to Jews being othered because of their religious beliefs, by both Christians and Muslims?
And that Jews are a multiracial, multinational people, bound by culture and history as well as religion?
And that Zionism is the national liberation movement of the Jewish nation, with a return to their Jewish homeland from which they were forcibly expelled in 60 CE, a place where they can practise self-determination like other nations, and offer shelter to Jews still experiencing antisemitism post-Holocaust, including those from Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Russia and France?
It took me three sentences to state it. Should be manageable to teach it.
Marcia Zalev, Toronto
What did kids learn at protest?
Ottawa protest ends on
saddest of notes, Raj, Feb. 19
Althia Raj correctly describes the sad situation in Ottawa. I heartily agree on so many levels.
Sad at the deaths due to COVID-19, sad for our flailing health-care system and medical professionals, and so sad to see so many misguided Canadians continue to resort to TikTok to receive and spew misinformation.
Most of all, I'm saddened by the children being used as pawns in the protest.
As a former nurse at the Hospital for Sick Children, I was mandated to uphold the safety of children. If a child came under my care that had been taken from his home, removed from school, was being sheltered in a vehicle and subjected to 24-hour horns and raucous parties, it would be my responsibility to report this to the police and Childrens Aid immediately as an emergency.
What are these poor children being taught in Ottawa?
That might is right? That obstruction of justice is acceptable? That laws are meant to be broken?
The entire situation is profoundly sad on so many levels, but most of all, these children, used as pawns are more than just collateral damage. These children are our future.
Heaven help us!
Sharon Pitto, Aurora
Toxic protest became intolerable
Where should we stand on the Emergencies Act?, Feb. 18
I can't help but wonder how these protesters would have been managed in an undemocratic country, like Russia or China.
Yes, it took too long to end this occupation, but at the end of the day they made themselves heard, they voiced their opinions and were actually given too much freedom to do so.
True freedom comes with a price, often paid for with lives lost, as seen in history.
Lets honour our freedom, so expensively paid for by the fallen, by peacefully voicing our opinion.
This protest was not peaceful; if it was, the protesters would have left when first asked to do so.
It became a horn-blaring, diesel-fumed, toxic occupation of public space.
Would the protesters tolerate the same behaviour in front of their own homes? I hardly think so.

Martin Regg Cohn: Russia is showing convoy protesters what an attack on freedom really looks like

Full text: The question, after the unthinkable invasion of Ukraine: What was Vladimir Putin thinking?
Here’s a related question: What were Canadians thinking during their own conflict of the last few weeks?
Amid the Russian mystery, any clarity here in Canada? For this is a fateful time to reflect on questions of sovereignty, democracy and “freedom.”
What do these values really mean? Or are they now meaningless — devalued by disinformation and dissembling?
Consider the front page of Thursday’s Toronto Star, which juxtaposed Canada’s recent domestic conflict versus the larger battle for the soul of Europe. Here’s how the two developing stories looked side by side:
Canada “revokes emergency measures,” declared the headline on the right-hand column, as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau gave the all-clear.
Ukraine “declares state of emergency” announced the left side of the front page, in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion.
Two countries, two realities, two emergencies. One internal, one external.
In democratic Canada, a contorted cry for “freedom” from the fringe. In democratic Ukraine, a desperate quest for freedom in the face of a totalitarian invasion.
On the same day, on the same front page.
At the very time Ukraine was buttressing its frontier against the threat of outside invaders, Canada was securing its own undefended border from within. Ontario’s Premier Doug Ford declared his own state of emergency to liberate a bridge — and an economy — held hostage.
It is easy enough to belittle the blockade at the bridge, to understate the occupation of Ottawa , and to exaggerate the danger of emergency declarations in Canada. But that would be a misreading of what happened here, how events are unfolding elsewhere — and where freedom truthfully fits in.
The special powers proclaimed by both federal and provincial governments succeeded where regular measures failed (someone had to compel the tow trucks that went AWOL). When the disruptions were removed, the declarations were rescinded.
Despite dire warnings of damage to democracy from limiting the “freedoms” of fringe leaders who flout laws and public health measures enacted by elected leaders, both levels of government did as promised: They dialed back their special powers ahead of schedule.
Once normality was restored, they returned to democratic norms.
Those democratic norms are the cornerstone of a democracy. When they are upended — as in Donald Trump’s America in the aftermath of the last election — no clauses in the Constitution or Charter of Rights will protect us.
That reality is worth repeating as we witness the dismantling and dismemberment of Ukraine’s democracy by an army commanded by a Russian dictator. For most people, where they stand on this international crisis depends on where their national interests lie.
The fault lines of democracy and disunity run deep. Not just across our country but around the world.
Under Trump’s successor as president, Joe Biden, America leads the way with the toughest economic sanctions and biggest military aid. Canada and the rest of the West are falling into line, more or less.
But other countries, and some other democracies, are finding their own balance between diplomacy and clarity:
India, the world’s largest democracy, made its decision early on. It chose to remain in the Russian camp, mindful of its military ties to supply lines dating to the Soviet era.
Israel, which styles itself the Middle East’s sole democracy, was also walking a fine line for fear of offending the Russian dictator who also calls the shots in neighbouring Syria. Turkey, which imagines itself a bulwark in the region, kept its distance.
While one democracy after another lost its voice, China’s autocracy was quietly clearing its throat. National sovereignty and territorial integrity are the bedrock of China’s foreign policy edifice — its rulers insisting that outsiders refrain from meddling in internal matters such as the so-called “renegade province” of Taiwan, or the supposedly autonomous regions of Hong Kong, Tibet and Xinjiang.
But after Putin dropped in on his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, breaking the diplomatic boycott over the Winter Olympics, Beijing now is looking the other way on sovereignty, and going its own way on sanctions. China is poised to profit from expanded trade with Russia, dealing a fatal blow to the West’s economic retaliation.
All that said, the unspoken reality is that sanctions were always symbolic. For all the Western unity, there is no international unanimity and thus no efficacy.
Sanctions were a deterrent, but they were discounted by a dictator who is not accountable to his people, and therefore impervious to pressure. He has already taken into account the benefits and costs of conquest, built up his financial reserves, rebuilt his military, and made his calculation in advance.
Canada, the first western country to recognize Ukrainian independence in 1991, has now joined in the sanctions and added to the condemnations. Canadians of Ukrainian descent, who make up the world’s largest diaspora outside of Eastern Europe, will be watching the death spiral of democracy in their ancestral land.
Amid the calamity, clarity emerges: Ukraine’s genuine struggle for sovereignty puts the lie to the false clamour for “freedom” from a fringe group at home.
Canada’s emergency has ended and its democracy endures. The same cannot be said for Ukraine’s emerging democracy and enduring emergency.

Shawn Micallef: To defeat Doug Ford in June, the opposition should defend local democracy by pledging to restore Toronto's city council

Full text: Ottawa city council held an absolutely bananas meeting during the occupation of their city two weeks ago. The mayor had just summarily removed members of Ottawa’s police board and the meeting was in desperate shambles, with some councillors begging for something to be done to help the under-siege residents of their city.
It’s common for people to tune out their own city council meetings, but this one had Ottawans and, more astoundingly, people from across the country tuning in. The stakes and drama were high.
As I watched from Toronto, I couldn’t help but notice how many councillors there are in Ottawa. A city of one million people, it has 23 councillors, plus a mayor. That’s just about the same as Toronto with its 25 councillors plus mayor. Difference is, Toronto has nearly three million people.
The reason for the discrepancy is well known: during the 2018 municipal elections happening across Ontario, Premier Doug Ford’s government chose to cut Toronto’s council in half, and only Toronto’s.
It can’t be overstated that this was during a supposedly democratic election.
Last week it was rich, then, when Ford answered a question about why he and his government didn’t act sooner to intervene in the Ottawa occupation by saying he didn’t like to barge into another jurisdiction . Rich, condescending and a plain false statement, but it’s also an opportunity.
The provincial election is in June so here’s a free platform for any of the opposition parties: pledge to reinstate Toronto’s full council. Doing so could endear them to many Torontonians. A stand for process-oriented and orderly democracy, when it’s under attack in so many places around the world, could also win people farther afield.
Only Toronto was targeted by Ford in 2018, proving it was his vendetta against old colleagues and communities, but everyone in Ontario should understand that what happened to Toronto’s local democracy could happen to theirs.
Suggesting that the recent Ottawa council meeting was bananas isn’t hyperbole — it was totally bananas — but it also isn’t a slight against Ottawa. Local councils across the country often look incredibly messy and argumentative at first glance. Short video clips of such moments are often the only council proceedings the average person sees. This was especially true during the Rob Ford era when there were many such moments.
It’s important to remember that municipal government works differently than either provincial or federal governments, where policy is largely formed behind closed doors, in caucus, before it’s presented, fully formed, for debate in the commons. At the municipal level there are no political parties or caucus, so everything happens in front of us: we get to see how the entire sausage is made, and sometimes it’s messy. A sausage factory will turn anyone into a vegetarian.
Don’t tune it out, though.
The mess has always made it easy for cynics, or those with political interest in keeping city councils weak, to disparage local government. And to be sure, it is unnecessarily messy and bananas at times, but that’s the price of democracy, democracy that is closest to the everyday lives of citizens. Less mess is less democracy.
Speaking of democracy, in pledging to return Toronto’s council to its pre-Ford-cut state, this doesn’t mean back up to 44 councillors and a mayor, as it was prior to the 2018 election. Rather, council was set to expand to 47 council seats so there were actually 47 council races thrown into turmoil back then.
Unlike the Ford cut, the decision to increase the number of city councillors was not arbitrary but the result of a years-long study and public consultation process undertaken by city staff to ensure better democratic balance and representation .
You may not like it, but a democratic process was followed, and to honour democracy and fair play, despite the constitutional power the province has over municipalities, it ought to be reset. Want fewer councillors? Then go through the process again. That’s how democracy works.
Some, even I, might be tempted to call for further election promises that give municipalities even more autonomy. That’s a sentiment I’ve long been sympathetic to, even supported. Perhaps not the “Province of Toronto,” but something toward that.
However, as the housing crisis and other politicized issues have increased in consequence, I’m not sure Toronto and other municipalities are ready to make the kinds of decisions needed when power is so vested in homeowners and councillors who are beholden to them — where, say, objecting to new housing developments is routine.
It’s all the same voters, of course, but a higher level of government can sometimes make harder decisions than the lower one. This is a reason why the old Metro Toronto government worked so well, dividing up these powers.
Finding that balance is the hard part, and the solution isn’t clear. What is clear is a good faith pledge to restore democratic order to Canada’s biggest city, and a pledge to protect democracy in other Ontario cities, would be a welcome part of this upcoming provincial election.

Full text: For weeks now, Liberals and Conservatives have accused each other of dividing the country, of playing wedge politics on COVID-19 vaccinations, of pouring gasoline on a fire by either rejecting calls to meet so-called “Freedom Convoy” demonstrators or cheering them on and refusing to ask the blockaders to go home.
Now, as parliamentarians prepare to review the federal government’s first invoking of the Emergencies Act, both parties remain entrenched in their corners, unwilling to put water in their wine and seek consensus for the good of the country.
At issue is the makeup of a special committee charged with reviewing the government’s actions. When the Emergencies Act was adopted in 1988, supervision of Parliament was a key facet. Parliament was given the ability to revoke a declaration of emergency (a vote in support happened Monday) and it was charged with reviewing the order after the fact.
After Prime Minister Justin Trudeau revoked the emergency measures on Wednesday, saying they were no longer necessary, he thankfully agreed scrutiny should still follow. Unfortunately, there’s disagreement on who should provide that scrutiny.
Liberal House Leader Mark Holland says the Tories are making “unreasonable” demands. Conservative House Leader John Brassard calls the government’s offer “absurd.”
The Liberals want a committee of three Grit MPs, two Conservatives, one Bloc Québécois, one NDP, and four senators, representing the major groups in the Senate, with the Bloc, the NDP and a senator acting as co-chairs.
“The chair would be neither a Liberal, whose government invoked [the] Emergencies Act,” Holland tweeted Thursday, “or a Conservative, whose party led the way in supporting protesters.”
Brassard said it’s disingenuous for the Liberals to suggest the Conservatives’ “implied support for the convoy” means their position would be prejudiced.
“This is an oversight committee,” he told me. “It’s not an opportunity for the government to stack the deck.” He believes the Grits’ offer gives the government “effectively the majority,” though it’s unclear what bias most senators hold.
The Tories originally proposed a 16-member committee modelled on another joint committee that would have given them at least a co-chair position. But the Liberals countered with the above offer after securing support from the NDP.
Upset, the Conservatives came back suggesting a five-person committee that met the strict definition of the act: at least one MP from each recognized party, and at least one senator from each party in the Senate that’s represented on the committee by an MP.
Because the act wasn’t updated after Trudeau came to office in 2015 with a pledge to make the Senate less partisan and more independent, the Conservatives argue this gives them one MP and the only senator, and both committee co-chairs.
“This is the prime minister’s problem,” Brassard said. “They’ve had six years to amend the act to reflect the current composition of the Senate, and they haven’t done that .”
It’s unrealistic to suggest the Liberals should have seen this coming, but now the Grits want to put their suggestion up for a vote — one they are likely to win. The Tories don’t seem upset by that. Brassard said he welcomes the debate — “I’ve got a lot to say.” The result is more division.
It’s discouraging and foreshadows more partisan games on a committee that should set the tone for how reviews are done in the future.
It’s imperative the use of the Emergencies Act is not normalized, that this be a rigorous exercise, and frankly, the Liberals should accept an opposition chair. There are worthwhile questions to be probed. Could the government have achieved its objectives through other means? Was the response — freezing bank accounts, for example — proportionate to the threat at hand?
“It’s a bit ridiculous at the moment,” the Bloc press secretary Julien Coulombe-Bonnafous told me. “What we are hoping for is a consensus. That this isn’t adopted by a vote after a debate, that everyone agrees together who the chair will be, and that it be as neutral as possible.”
What shook many Canadians to the core during the convoy’s occupation of Ottawa was the perceived breakdown of government institutions. The police weren’t seen to do their job, nor was the province of Ontario. The federal government seemed to act late, and then perhaps too heavy-handedly. Now that order is restored, confidence also needs to be restored. The best way for that to happen is a truly transparent and neutral process: a full public inquiry, and a committee process free of partisan bickering.
At least we now know that all the regulations and proclamations made under the Emergencies Act were published, which means the parliamentary committee has few reasons to meet behind closed doors.

Full text: World is ‘done’ with COVID and it’s time to move on from restrictions: Ford, Feb. 15
While Doug Ford has stated that he and the world are done with COVID-19, it is most certainly not done with us.
I hold up my own experience with my pickup hockey league as evidence. At my local arena just one week after dropping the COVID-19 pre-screening form, 16 of 20 fully vaccinated players have tested positive. These positive tests have spread into extended families.
Come next week, the unvaccinated will be allowed to enter restaurants and public venues with the rest of us.
For nearly two years we’ve been asked to make sacrifices for the greater good and next week those who didn’t will share the same air space as those who did.
Ford is less interested in COVID-19 than his fortunes in the upcoming provincial election.

A billion for re-election, Feb. 10
I am wondering how I can best channel the frustration and despondency I feel as I witness the Ford government’s crass decision to cancel the $120-licence fee and to rebate the amount to Ontarians just before the election.
For sure, I will cast my vote for one of the other parties, but I will also donate whatever refund I receive to one of the many services that will experience the reduced funding which will be the result of this billion-dollar election ploy. I may not be able to stop this populist electioneering, but I will not allow myself to personally profit from it.
Joseph Vorstermans, Toronto
A billion for re-election, Feb. 10
I have never seen such a blatant buying of votes as Doug Ford’s government scrapping and refunding the licence plate renewal fee and dropping of tolls on some provincial highways.
This is targeted to his support base in suburban Ontario where multiple vehicle ownership is necessary because of the inadequacy of public transit and poor community design resulting in a lack of walkability.
Given the climate crisis, we should not be giving private car ownership any financial incentives.
I think the province spending that billion dollars on affordable housing would have a much bigger impact on the quality of life of all our communities.
The Ford government says their priorities are climate, education, health and housing, but they would give away a billion dollars to support the driving of cars and their production of greenhouse gases to buy your vote.
I hope Ontarians will remember how two-faced this government is when it is time to vote.

Full text: Ottawa city council held an absolutely bananas meeting during the occupation of their city two weeks ago. The mayor had just summarily removed members of Ottawa's police board and the meeting was in desperate shambles, with some councillors begging for something to be done to help the under-siege residents of their city.
It's common for people to tune out their own city council meetings, but this one had Ottawans and, more astoundingly, people from across the country tuning in. The stakes and drama were high.
As I watched from Toronto, I couldn't help but notice how many councillors there are in Ottawa. A city of one million people, it has 23 councillors, plus a mayor. That's just about the same as Toronto with its 25 councillors plus mayor. Difference is, Toronto has nearly three million people.
The reason for the discrepancy is well known: during the 2018 municipal elections happening across Ontario, Premier Doug Ford's government chose to cut Toronto's council in half, and only Toronto's.
It can't be overstated that this was during a supposedly democratic election.
Last week it was rich, then, when Ford answered a question about why he and his government didn't act sooner to intervene in the Ottawa occupation by saying he didn't like to barge into another jurisdiction. Rich, condescending and a plain false statement, but it's also an opportunity.
The provincial election is in June so here's a free platform for any of the opposition parties: pledge to reinstate Toronto's full council. Doing so could endear them to many Torontonians. A stand for process-oriented and orderly democracy, when it's under attack in so many places around the world, could also win people farther afield.
Only Toronto was targeted by Ford in 2018, proving it was his vendetta against old colleagues and communities, but everyone in Ontario should understand that what happened to Toronto's local democracy could happen to theirs.
Suggesting that the recent Ottawa council meeting was bananas isn't hyperbole - it was totally bananas - but it also isn't a slight against Ottawa.
Local councils across the country often look incredibly messy and argumentative at first glance. Short video clips of such moments are often the only council proceedings the average person sees. This was especially true during the Rob Ford era when there were many such moments.
It's important to remember that municipal government works differently than either provincial or federal governments, where policy is largely formed behind closed doors, in caucus, before it's presented, fully formed, for debate in the commons. At the municipal level there are no political parties or caucus, so everything happens in front of us: we get to see how the entire sausage is made, and sometimes it's messy. A sausage factory will turn anyone into a vegetarian.
Don't tune it out, though.
The mess has always made it easy for cynics, or those with political interest in keeping city councils weak, to disparage local government. And to be sure, it is unnecessarily messy and bananas at times, but that's the price of democracy, democracy that is closest to the everyday lives of citizens. Less mess is less democracy.
Speaking of democracy, in pledging to return Toronto's council to its pre-Ford-cut state, this doesn't mean back up to 44 councillors and a mayor, as it was prior to the 2018 election.
Rather, council was set to expand to 47 council seats so there were actually 47 council races thrown into turmoil back then.
Unlike the Ford cut, the decision to increase the number of city councillors was not arbitrary but the result of a years-long study and public consultation process undertaken by city staff to ensure better democratic balance and representation.
You may not like it, but a democratic process was followed, and to honour democracy and fair play, despite the constitutional power the province has over municipalities, it ought to be reset. Want fewer councillors? Then go through the process again. That's how democracy works.
Some, even I, might be tempted to call for further election promises that give municipalities even more autonomy. That's a sentiment I've long been sympathetic to, even supported. Perhaps not the "Province of Toronto," but something toward that.
However, as the housing crisis and other politicized issues have increased in consequence, I'm not sure Toronto and other municipalities are ready to make the kinds of decisions needed when power is so vested in homeowners and councillors who are beholden to them - where, say, objecting to new housing developments is routine.
It's all the same voters, of course, but a higher level of government can sometimes make harder decisions than the lower one. This is a reason why the old Metro Toronto government worked so well, dividing up these powers.
Finding that balance is the hard part, and the solution isn't clear. What is clear is a good faith pledge to restore democratic order to Canada's biggest city, and a pledge to protect democracy in other Ontario cities, would be a welcome part of this upcoming provincial election.

What assault on freedom really looks like

Full text: The question, after the unthinkable invasion of Ukraine: What was Vladimir Putin thinking?
Here's a related question: What were Canadians thinking during their own conflict of the last few weeks?
Amid the Russian mystery, any clarity here in Canada? For this is a fateful time to reflect on questions of sovereignty, democracy and "freedom."
What do these values really mean? Or are they now meaningless - devalued by disinformation and dissembling?
Consider the front page of Thursday's Toronto Star, which juxtaposed Canada's recent domestic conflict versus the larger battle for the soul of Europe. Here's how the two developing stories looked side by side:
Canada "revokes emergency measures," declared the headline on the right-hand column, as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau gave the all-clear.
Ukraine "declares state of emergency" announced the left side of the front page, in the aftermath of Russia's invasion.
Two countries, two realities, two emergencies. One internal, one external.
In democratic Canada, a contorted cry for "freedom" from the fringe. In democratic Ukraine, a desperate quest for freedom in the face of a totalitarian invasion.
On the same day, on the same front page.
At the very time Ukraine was buttressing its frontier against the threat of outside invaders, Canada was securing its own undefended border from within. Ontario Premier Doug Ford declared his own state of emergency to liberate a bridge - and an economy - held hostage.
It is easy enough to belittle the blockade at the bridge, to understate the occupation of Ottawa, and to exaggerate the danger of emergency declarations in Canada. But that would be a misreading of what happened here, how events are unfolding elsewhere - and where freedom truthfully fits in.
The special powers proclaimed by both federal and provincial governments succeeded where regular measures failed (someone had to compel the tow trucks that went AWOL). When the disruptions were removed, the declarations were rescinded.
Despite dire warnings of damage to democracy from limiting the "freedoms" of fringe leaders who flout laws and public health measures enacted by elected leaders, both levels of government did as promised: They dialed back their special powers ahead of schedule.
Once normality was restored, they returned to democratic norms.
Those democratic norms are the cornerstone of a democracy. When they are upended - as in Donald Trump's America in the aftermath of the last election - no clauses in the Constitution or Charter of Rights and Freedoms will protect us.
That reality is worth repeating as we witness the dismantling and dismemberment of Ukraine's democracy by an army commanded by a Russian dictator. For most people, where they stand on this international crisis depends on where their national interests lie.
The fault lines of democracy and disunity run deep. Not just across our country but around the world.
Under Trump's successor as president, Joe Biden, the United States leads the way with the toughest economic sanctions and biggest military aid. Canada and the rest of the West are falling into line, more or less.
But other countries, and some other democracies, are finding their own balance between diplomacy and clarity:
India, the world's largest democracy, made its decision early on. It chose to remain in the Russian camp, mindful of its military ties to supply lines dating to the Soviet era.
Israel, which styles itself the Middle East's sole democracy, was also walking a fine line for fear of offending the Russian dictator who also calls the shots in neighbouring Syria. Turkey, which imagines itself a bulwark in the region, kept its distance.
While one democracy after another lost its voice, China's autocracy was quietly clearing its throat. National sovereignty and territorial integrity are the bedrock of China's foreign policy edifice - its rulers insisting that outsiders refrain from meddling in internal matters such as the so-called "renegade province" of Taiwan, or the supposedly autonomous regions of Hong Kong, Tibet and Xinjiang.
But after Putin dropped in on his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, breaking the diplomatic boycott over the Winter Olympics, Beijing now is looking the other way on sovereignty, and going its own way on sanctions. China is poised to profit from expanded trade with Russia, dealing a fatal blow to the West's economic retaliation.
All that said, the unspoken reality is that sanctions were always symbolic. For all the western unity, there is no international unanimity and thus no efficacy.
Sanctions were a deterrent, but they were discounted by a dictator who is not accountable to his people, and therefore impervious to pressure.
He has already taken into account the benefits and costs of conquest, built up his financial reserves, rebuilt his military, and made his calculation in advance.
Canada, the first western country to recognize Ukrainian independence in 1991, has now joined in the sanctions and added to the condemnations. Canadians of Ukrainian descent, who make up the world's largest diaspora outside of Eastern Europe, will be watching the death spiral of democracy in their ancestral land.
Amid the calamity, clarity emerges: Ukraine's genuine struggle for sovereignty puts the lie to the false clamour for "freedom" from a fringe group at home.
Canada's emergency has ended and its democracy endures. The same cannot be said for Ukraine's emerging democracy and enduring emergency.

Full text: The latest on Russia and Ukraine from Canada and around the world Friday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available .
9:27 p.m. Ukraine braced for an all-out assault on its capital Friday, according to the New York Times, as the military blew up a bridge to slow the advance of Russian soldiers, street fights erupted in a northern district of the city, and the nation’s leaders warned residents that Russia wanted to “bring the capital to its knees.”
The moves to defend Kyiv escalated on the second day of a Russian military incursion. The fighting came as western governments imposed new sanctions, including on Russian President Vladimir Putin, tens of thousands of refugees fled the country, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared in a video warning that Russian forces planned to make an all-out attack and “the fate of Ukraine is now being decided.”
Zelenskyy warned that Russian “sabotage groups” had entered the city with the aim of “destroying the head of state.”
A U.S. Defense Department official said the Russians were “not moving on Kyiv as fast as they anticipated it going” and that, significantly, “Ukrainian command and control is intact” to direct the defense of the country. But officials warned that as of Friday morning Russia had sent into Ukraine only 30% of the 150,000 to 190,000 troops it had massed at the border.
9:11 p.m. Just over 24 hours after Russia invaded Ukraine, the Ukrainian Canadian Congress (UCC) and Stand with Ukraine committee, held an emergency rally at the Ukrainian Consulate, Friday evening.
Toronto’s Ukrainian community and its supporters gathered at Lakeshore Boulevard West, chanting protest slogans and telling sympathizers how they can help.
Alexandra Chyczij, president of the UCC’s national branch told the Star, “since the bombing started, we have seen the devastation that has been wrought upon Ukraine from the sky .... And so we’re calling upon the western allies to create a no fly-zone over Ukraine.”
Read more from the Star’s Simran Singh.
8:16 p.m. It was a bittersweet moment when Beka Lomadze and his older sister Anna got their visas to resettle in Canada from Ukraine in 2019, but the siblings were hopeful their parents and two younger brothers would follow suit in the near future.
Those family members have lived since 2012 in limbo in Ukraine, where they got stuck while en route to Belgium, in which they had intended to seek asylum from religious persecution by Orthodox Christians in their native Georgia.
With the tension between Russia and Ukraine rising in the region in recent months, Lomadze and his sister were praying that the rest of their family could join them in Toronto before war started.
Read the full story from the Star’s Nicholas Keung.
8:14 p.m. Thousands of refugees have streamed across the border from Ukraine to escape the Russian invasion, while several countries in eastern Europe set up reception points, anticipating rising numbers as the attacks continued unabated.
More than 10,000 people entered Romania from Ukraine within 24 hours, Romanian Interior Minister Lucian Bode said on Friday. That is more than twice as many as immediately before the invasion, he said.
Of the 10,624 Ukrainians who entered, 3,660 have since traveled on, including to Bulgaria and Hungary, the minister added. Just 11 people applied for asylum in Romania.
Slovakia registered more than 7,000 border crossings from Ukraine on the first day after the Russian invasion.
7:37 p.m. Vladimir Putin has committed several heinous crimes in invading Ukraine . What we are not hearing is that all the posturing by Joe Biden, Justin Trudeau, and other Western leaders won’t change, indeed, is not designed to change, the reality of Russian occupation of a sovereign nation and its 43 million citizens.
Sanctions could possibly have been effective had they been imposed months earlier — along with the uprooting of dirty Russian money invested in real estate in London, New York and possibly Toronto. Or, better, by letting Ukraine join NATO when Putin was still weak.
Now the sanctions will be pinpricks for the Kremlin. And perhaps prove as ineffective as the American sanctions on Cuba for the last 60 years, on Iran for 41 years, on Saddam Hussein through the 1990s, and on the Afghan Taliban in the 1990s and again since last August when they reconquered Kabul. The ever-escalating penalties made little difference to the rulers — they helped entrench them — but squeezed and starved and displaced millions of ordinary Cubans, Iranians, Iraqis and Afghans.
Read the latest column from Haroon Siddiqui.
7:34 p.m. If the battle for Ukraine boils down to missiles versus money, it must be said that Canada will have limited impact.
The prime minister said it himself, in fact. Amidst the name-calling and the threats from our cabinet ministers to severely punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for invading Ukraine, Justin Trudeau has flatly stated that there’s only so much a middle power like Canada can do.
So let’s focus on where Canada can actually help most effectively — not in punishing Putin, but in helping Ukrainians, especially if they’re fleeing and in need of a safe haven.
The Star’s Heather Scoffield has more.
7:30 p.m. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov justifies Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on behalf of Vladimir Putin.
His daughter, Lisa Peskova, opposes it.
At least, she did for a short while on Friday when her Instagram feed bore the words, in Cyrillic, “NO WAR” — the tag line of Russians denouncing the attack on their western neighbour.
Sofia Abramovich, the daughter of Russian oligarch and Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich, did the same. An attack on Ukraine, her social media post insisted, was Putin’s twisted desire, not that of ordinary Russians.
As a fuller scope emerges of the sanctions being imposed, the borders being closed and the means of contact and communication being cut in retribution for Russia’s attack on Ukraine, an unusual thing is occurring.
The Star’s Allan Woods writes from Moscow.
7:23 p.m. (UPDATED) Russia vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution on Friday demanding that Moscow immediately stop its attack on Ukraine and withdraw all troops, a defeat the United States and its supporters knew was inevitable but said would highlight Russia’s global isolation.
The vote was 11 in favor, with Russia voting no and China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstaining, which showed significant but not total opposition to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of his country's smaller and militarily weaker neighbor.
The resolution's failure paves the way for supporters to call for a quick vote on a similar resolution in the 193-member U.N. General Assembly, where there are no vetoes. There was no immediate word on a timetable for an assembly vote.
7:09 p.m. The Biden administration wants Congress to provide $6.4 billion to pay for an initial U.S. response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with much of it for military and humanitarian assistance in the region, two people familiar with the request said Friday.
The largest portions of the money would be for the Defense and State departments and for the U.S. Agency for International Development, which distributes civilian foreign aid, one of the people said. Smaller amounts would be for the Treasury and Commerce departments, whose chief roles in the Ukraine crisis will be to apply sanctions against Russia, its financial institutions and state-owned businesses and its leaders, including President Vladimir Putin.
The request, which White House and other administration officials described to congressional aides in a conference call, provides an early look at the costs American taxpayers could bear as a result of Russia’s attack on its western neighbor. Those assaults were in their second full day Friday as Russian forces pounded Kyiv, Ukraine's capital.
6:28 p.m. A man holding signs outside of a bus window with the words “War Stop.” A woman being led away by police while clasping balloons in the colours of the Ukrainian flag. Police wrestling a protester to the ground as bystanders watch cautiously.
These were the scenes circulating in photos and videos posted to social media Thursday as thousands of Russians took to the streets in opposition to the invasion of Ukraine, prompting some media pundits to ponder if Russian President Vladimir Putin had overestimated domestic support for a military operation.
For people like Mariya H., an ethnic Russian who grew up in Ukraine, there was a sense of being torn between two lands as she watched news of the invasion in Ukraine. (She asked to not use her last name because she’s worried it could be connected to family in Russia.)

5:50 p.m. Premier John Horgan says British Columbia supports the people of Ukraine in their battle to turn back Russian military forces and President Vladimir Putin.
He says B.C. is working with the federal government and will support whatever sanctions Canada can impose to help condemn Russian actions. Horgan says he hopes international pressure will convince Putin to turn back his troops.
Earlier this week, B.C.’s political leaders, including Shirley Bond of the Opposition B.C. Liberals and Green Leader Sonia Furstenau, delivered emotional statements of support for the Ukrainian people in the legislature.
The flag of Ukraine is flying at the B.C. legislature.
5:44 p.m. What are Canada’s sanctions against Russia and how do they stack up to other countries’?
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau outlined on Thursday moves to penalize 31 individuals and 27 banks and entities connected to Russia’s ruling elite; to curb about $750 million in Canadian exports to Russia, particularly in aerospace, IT and mineral shipments; and to bar any dealings with several Russian financial institutions.
Among the people blacklisted are members of the Russian elite, their families, and Vladimir Putin’s lieutenants on his government’s security council: Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu, Justice Minister Konstantin Chuychenko, and Finance Minister Anton Siluanov. (Missing are Putin’s top deputy Sergey Lavrov and Putin himself.)
The federal Liberal government and its other allies including the U.S. did not immediately move to cut Russia out of the SWIFT global financial transaction system, target Putin outright or Lavrov, or hit Moscow’s ability to raise money by banning Russian oil and gas exports — although Trudeau said all options are on the table.

5:36 p.m. In what is being considered Europe’s greatest security crisis in decades, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Thursday with its military attacking the country from three sides leaving desperate people to flee bombs and bullets, and seek refuge in makeshift bomb shelters. While countries including Canada are responding to the invasion with economic measures and sanctions, Russia continues to proceed into Ukraine with alarming speed.
In today’s episode of This Matters , we bring you urgent voices from inside the war in Ukraine including a Ukrainian-Canadian father desperate to get his family out and Sara Firth, a British foreign correspondent in Kyiv. The first conversation in the podcast was edited for clarity and to eliminate any people or place names that could identify our speaker or his family, as we are not revealing his identity for his safety.

5:25 p.m. “It is like a knife to the throat.” That’s how Vladimir Putin described the possibility of Ukraine joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in his lengthy address on Feb. 21, in which he laid out his reasons for invading Ukraine.
Putin mentioned NATO 40 times in the speech.
He views the 30-country military alliance, led by the United States, as an existential threat to Russia, particularly as its membership has expanded eastward and now includes several former Soviet countries.

5 p.m. Washington Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin asked for “ no more war ” Friday in his first media availability since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The Moscow native said he has “lots of friends in Russia and Ukraine” and hopes the attack will end soon.
“Please, no more war,“ Ovechkin said. ”It doesn’t matter who is in the war, Russia, Ukraine, different countries … We have to live in peace and a great world.”
Asked if he supported the invasion, Ovechkin replied: “I’m Russian, right? … It’s not in my hands.
4:46 p.m. (updated) The Canadian government is joining the United States and European partners in aiming punitive sanctions directly at Russian President Vladimir Putin as NATO bolstered defensive forces outside Ukraine’s border.
And Canada is throwing its support behind a growing call to evict Russia from the global financial transaction system, known as SWIFT, “to make it more difficult for Putin to finance his brutality.”
Government officials have said that Canada alone can’t effect a big impact on the SWIFT system but a co-ordinated response can.

4:45 p.m. A cybersecurity expert says Canadian businesses are at risk of being targeted for online attacks if Russia chooses to retaliate against government sanctions.
Karim Hijazi, founder and CEO of Texas-based cyberintelligence firm Prevailion, says that Canadian companies could be victims of bad actors trying to compromise critical infrastructure and government entities.
He says this could be the likely approach because government, critical infrastructure and the private sector are so intertwined and subject to easy access.

4:40 p.m. Among the various kinds of assistance Ukraine is asking of its international allies , such as weapons and economic sanctions, one measure on which the international community has not agreed is SWIFT.
That stands for Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, which tracks and provides security for trillions of dollars in international transactions daily. Without SWIFT, it is possible to transfer money internationally, but it is a lot slower.
A Russia cut off from SWIFT would be severely isolated. In 2014, when the U.S. considered removing Russia from access to SWIFT because of its annexation of Crimea , Russia’s then-prime minister said the move would be equivalent to a “declaration of war.”
That’s mostly because it would severely hamper Russia’s ability to profit from oil and gas exports, the driving force of the country’s economy.
Read the Star’s explainer: What is SWIFT and why haven’t countries expelled Russia from it yet?
4 p.m. The Biden administration announced Friday that it will move to freeze the assets of President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, following the European Union and Britain in directly sanctioning top Russian leadership.
The Treasury Department announced the sanctions shortly after the EU said it had also approved an asset freeze against Putin and Lavrov as part of a broader package of sanctions against Russia for the invasion of Ukraine. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson also told NATO leaders during a call Friday that Britain would move to impose sanctions against Putin and Lavrov.
It wasn’t immediately clear how impactful an asset freeze would be on Putin or Lavrov, but the direct action targeting the Russian president was meant to be seen as a warning to Putin that he could emerge as an international pariah if he doesn’t end the invasion of Ukraine.
3:51 p.m. Chad Martz has spent the last few days in a mountainous region of western Ukraine purchasing food and basic supplies for those who’ve fled their homes due to the Russian invasion of the country.
But the Canadian citizen, who has been in the country for months due to his work with a British Columbia aid organization, isn’t currently going anywhere himself.
“The area that I’m in ... hasn’t received any attacks, so it’s been staying relatively calm,” he said in a phone interview on Friday.

3:46 p.m. As Russia invades Ukraine, launching the largest attack on European soil since the Second World War, the Star is working to demystify the complex geopolitics behind the war by answering reader questions. Here, we look at: Does China support the Russian invasion of Ukraine?
Officially, China has tried to stay neutral on Vladimir Putin’s attack on Ukraine , but its sympathies are clearly with Russia. The Chinese government, led by President Xi Jinping, has neither condemned Russia nor described the war as an invasion at all, preferring obfuscating euphemisms such as “the situation in Ukraine.”
China’s regime has criticized economic sanctions against Putin’s, and said it “understands Russia’s legitimate security concerns ” with regards to NATO’s eastward expansion. At the same time China has affirmed the “sovereignty and territorial integrity” of all countries, urged both sides to “exercise restraint” and encouraged negotiation.

3:35 p.m. Canadian phone companies are waiving long-distance and text charges for calls to Ukraine amid Russia’s assault on the country.
Bell Canada, Rogers Communications Inc., Telus Corp. and Shaw Communications Inc. have all announced customers will not be charged to help connect with loved ones in the embattled region.
Rogers and its mobile subsidiary Fido Solutions say long-distance and text charges will be set aside, as will roaming fees for clients in Ukraine until the end of March.

3:30 p.m. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted a number of swift retaliatory measures from governments across the globe, but the disapproval of President Vladimir Putin’s aggressive actions in the region goes beyond politics and financial sanctions.
Various sporting and cultural events have already announced they would move or cancel events to take place in Russia or involve the country, with more to possibly come. Soccer’s UEFA was one of the first, announcing the Champions League final in May would move to Paris from St. Petersburg.
It’s not uncommon for repercussions, relocations and boycotts to happen on the cultural front during times of war, and this list will most likely continue to grow as tensions escalate between Russia and the West.
Here’s what’s changing and why , by the Star’s Justin Smirlies.
3:25 p.m. Ontario’s premier says he wants the federal government to fast-track Ukrainian refugees to his province.
Doug Ford says Ontario has jobs and settlement services available to people fleeing the country following Russia’s invasion.
He says he will be speaking with the federal government in the coming days to discuss how Ontario can help speed up the process for potential refugees.

2:52 p.m. (updated): The LCBO has been ordered to pull Russian spirits and other products from all liquor store shelves following the invasion of Ukraine by Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“The people of Ontario will always stand against tyranny and oppression. To that end, I am directing the LCBO to withdraw all products produced in Russia from store shelves,” Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy said Friday.
His order followed a similar request of the LCBO from Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca earlier in the day, but Premier Doug Ford told reporters the measure had already been under discussion.

2:32 p.m. NATO leaders meeting virtually Friday “to discuss the gravest threat to Euro-Atlantic security in decades.”
NATO called on Russia “to stop this senseless war, immediately cease its assault, withdraw all its forces from Ukraine, and turn back to the path of dialogue and turn away from aggression,” said NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.
The organization said the long-planned attack on Ukraine “is brutal and wholly unprovoked and unjustified,” condemning the tragic loss of life and human suffering caused by Russia so far.
“The world will hold Russia, as well as Belarus, accountable for their actions. We call on all states to condemn this unconscionable attack unreservedly. No one should be fooled by the Russian government’s barrage of lies,” NATO’s statement reads.
2:26 p.m. Rallies took place around the world on Friday, including in Tbilisi, Georgia, where large crowds gathered in front of parliament to protest the war in Ukraine.
People were reportedly demanding that Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili step down after he said he would not introduce sanctions against Russia in response to its large-scale invasion of Ukraine that began on Thursday.
2:22 p.m. U.S. President Joe Biden and his NATO counterparts agreed Friday to send thousands of troops backed by air and naval support to protect allies near Russia and Ukraine in response to President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade, the organization’s top civilian official said.
Speaking after chairing a NATO summit, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the 30-nation organization will send parts of the NATO Response Force and elements of a quickly deployable spearhead unit to the alliance’s eastern flank. It’s the first time the force has been used to defend NATO allies.
Stoltenberg did not say how many troops would be sent or where they might go, but he did confirm that the move would involve land, sea and air power.
In response to Europe’s biggest security crisis in decades, Stoltenberg said, “We are now deploying the NATO Response Force for the first time in a collective defense context. We speak about thousands of troops. We speak about air and maritime capabilities.”
“There must be no space for miscalculation or misunderstanding. We will do what it takes to protect and defend every ally, and every inch of NATO territory,” he said.
The NRF can number up to 40,000 troops, but Stoltenberg said that NATO would not be deploying the entire force. Parts of a spearhead unit known in NATO jargon as the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, which is currently led by France, will also be sent.
The announcement came after NATO members, ranging from Russia’s neighbor Estonia in the north down around the west of conflict-hit Ukraine to Bulgaria on the Black Sea coast, triggered urgent consultations Thursday about their security amid concerns from the invasion.
12:41 p.m. China and India were organizing evacuation flights to collect citizens stranded and unable to fly home after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine threatened to generate a refugee crisis.
Other governments and United Nations officials were assessing how to extract people as Russian forces attacked Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv. The country’s airspace has been shut down due to safety concerns, leaving people to travel by land to surrounding countries as the only way to evacuate.
The conflict could generate as many as 4 million refugees if the Russian invasion now in its second day continues, the U.N. said Friday in Geneva. Its International Civil Aviation Organization, which promotes cooperation and diplomacy in global aviation, was to discuss the conflict at a previously scheduled meeting, spokesman Anthony Philbin said via phone. He declined to comment on the deliberations.
The proximity of the conflict and the availability of commercial flights from neighboring countries like Hungary, Romania and Poland have lessened the need for European governments to send dedicated aircraft to extract people. The U.K., for example, hasn’t yet decided to launch a charter operation, instead instructing citizens to leave the country as soon as possible using commercial flights.
Countries much further away were chartering jets to bridge gaps in commercial networks.
12:23 p.m. (updated) The Canadian Press has learned the federal government plans to match donations individuals make to the Canadian Red Cross to help bring humanitarian relief to Ukraine.
The campaign, which is to begin today and run until March 18, will see the government match donations by Canadians dollar for dollar to a maximum of $10 million, says a senior government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss matters not yet public.
The head of Save the Children Canada is also urging Canadians to donate funds to help the humanitarian efforts on the ground as the fighting continues in Ukraine.

12:10 p.m. Europe is facing a massive new migration crisis because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Canada should prepare to provide asylum to those fleeing the violence, says a Canadian security expert.
“This would be a chance for Canada to really, really step up to the plate,” said Michael Bociurkiw, a Canadian in Ukraine who served as the spokesman for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe during the height of tensions following Russia’s annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014.
“Telling Ukrainians: you are welcome in Canada. And, you know, easing of visa rules, temporary stays, that sort of thing.”
Canada has promised to prioritize immigration applications from Ukraine to bring people fleeing the country to safety as quickly as possible.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also announced the creation of a new hotline Thursday, “for anyone at home or abroad with urgent Ukraine-related immigration questions.”
11:55 a.m. Russian authorities on Friday announced the “partial restriction” of access to Facebook after the social media network limited the accounts of several Kremlin-backed media over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Russian state communications watchdog Roskomnadzor said Friday it demanded that Facebook lift the restrictions it placed Thursday on state news agency RIA Novosti, state TV channel Zvezda, and pro-Kremlin news sites Lenta.Ru and Gazeta.Ru. The agency said Facebook didn't reinstate the media outlets.
The restrictions on the accounts, according to Roskomnadzor, included marking their content as unreliable and imposing technical restrictions on the search results to reduce the publications’ audiences on Facebook.
Roskomnadzor said its “partial restriction” on Facebook takes effect Friday, without clarifying what exactly the move means.
In its official statement, Roskomnadzor cast its action as ’“measures to protect Russian media.” It said Russia’s Foreign Ministry and the Prosecutor General’s office found Facebook “complicit in violation of fundamental human rights and freedoms, as well as the rights and freedoms of Russian nationals.”
11:41 a.m. Just say “nyet” to Russian vodka.
Ontario’s liquor retailer has been asked by Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca to pull bottles of Russian vodka from its store shelves over the invasion of Ukraine.
As a Crown corporation, the Liquor Control Board of Ontario should remove the products “to show support for an independent Ukraine by halting all commerce with Russia until their troops are withdrawn,” Del Duca wrote Friday to LCBO president George Soleas.
The letter was sent a day after all parties in the legislature condemned the invasion and Premier Doug Ford branded Russian President Vladimir Putin a “thug” before announcing a $300,000 donation from the province to the Canada-Ukraine Foundation for medical aid, food and shelter as Ukraine is racked by combat. The federal government has also announced sanctions against Russia.

11:27 a.m. Russian troops bore down on Ukraine’s capital Friday, with gunfire and explosions resonating ever closer to the government quarter, in an invasion of a democratic country that has fueled fears of wider war in Europe and triggered worldwide efforts to make Russia stop.
With reports of hundreds of casualties from the warfare — including shelling that sliced through a Kyiv apartment building and pummeled bridges and schools — there also were growing signs that Vladimir Putin’s Russia may be seeking to overthrow Ukraine’s government in his boldest effort yet to redraw the world map and revive Moscow’s Cold War-era influence.
In the fog of war, it was unclear how much of Ukraine remains under Ukrainian control and how much Russian forces have seized. The Kremlin accepted Kyiv’s offer to hold talks, but with Russia in the driver’s seat, it appeared to be an effort to squeeze concessions out of Ukraine’s embattled president instead of a gesture toward a diplomatic solution.

11:15 a.m. The Council of Europe has suspended Russia from the continent's human rights organization because of its invasion of Ukraine.
The 47-nation council announced Friday that Russia was suspended with “immediate effect” from the organization's Committee of Ministers and parliamentary assembly on Friday “as a result of the Russian Federation’s armed attack on Ukraine.”
The Strasbourg-based organization, which was founded in 1949, said Russia remained a member and continued to be bound by relevant human rights conventions.
11:09 a.m. Now that Russian President Vladimir Putin has invaded Ukraine and foreclosed his other options, certain aspects of the near future have become clear. So have some aspects of the longer run. Here are 10 predictions, made with varying degrees of confidence.
1. Ukraine’s organized military forces won’t be able to fight for long. Its armed forces are smaller and less well-equipped than the Russian invasion force, they are being attacked simultaneously from the north, east and south, and above all they lack air cover.
Russian cruise missiles have already struck most Ukrainian airbases and command centres, and Ukranian forces in the field will be cut up into small groups, surrounded and overwhelmed. Arming civilians won’t help; it will just get them killed. Organized combat will probably be over in a week, although fighting in the cities could last a little longer.
2. There will be an underground resistance movement at least for a while, but don’t imagine Ukrainians are going to be the new Viet Cong. This is an urban society, and the resistance will rely on ambushes, assassinations and IEDs. The Russians will call it “terrorism.”
3. Putin says “We do not intend to occupy Ukraine,” but of course Russia will. The only question is whether they will stop at Dnieper River (plus Kyiv, on the west bank), or take the western half of the country too.
Resistance will be stronger in the west, where Ukrainian nationalism has deeper roots. However, Putin’s denial of the legitimacy of the Ukrainian state — and indeed of a separate Ukrainian identity — means he can’t really leave the west out. The logic of his argument is that all the people on this “ancient Russian land” must be resubmerged in a greater Russian identity.

10:57 a.m. Even the smallest act of defiance in Russia takes a giant dose of courage.
That is the way it was in Soviet times. And that is the way it was the day that Russia invaded Ukraine .
A day that began before the sun rose with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s paranoid justification for war: an attack by the West against Russia was a certainty unless Russia brought to bloody completion the brutal military buildup on Ukraine’s borders.
“You and I,” he said, “simply have not been left with any other opportunity to protect Russia, our people, except for the one that we will be forced to use today.”
As a journalist who’s been observing the bobbing and weaving between Moscow, Washington, Brussels and Kyiv, Putin’s words brought a horrible certainty that had been absent in the many frantic days leading up to it.
At long last, there was no question in the morning about how the day would end.

10:52 a.m. The pandemic, mass shootings, natural disasters, terror attacks. There’s been plenty of tragedy and anxiety for parents to sort through with their kids. Add Russia’s escalating invasion of Ukraine to the list.
With events rapidly unfolding on TV and across social media, child development experts urge parents to check in with children of all ages but not to worry if those conversations are brief.
“For children under the age of 7, it might just be acknowledging that something is happening between Ukraine and Russia and ask, ‘Have you heard anything?’ Take the child’s lead,“ said Janine Domingues, a clinical psychologist at the nonprofit Child Mind Institute in New York.
For all ages, honesty is paramount, she and others said.
“Overall, just provide reassurance, that this is what we know right now. Let them know you don’t know all the answers but here are some places we can go,” Domingues said.
Around the globe, from the U.S. to Western Europe, Japan to South Korea and Australia, c ountries immediately denounced the Kremlin as Thursday’s fighting raised fear, sending stocks tumbling and oil prices surging. President Joe Biden slapped Russia with some of the broadest and toughest financial penalties the world’s largest economy can muster.

10:41 a.m. Chinese state media left Russia’s invasion of Ukraine off their front pages Friday as Beijing weighed its response, even as the outbreak of war in Europe dominated conversations on Chinese social media.
People’s Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist Party, put the war on the bottom of page three on Friday, carrying a small piece on Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s call with his Russian counterpart and criticism of the U.S. for “hyping” a military offensive that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the biggest conflict in Europe since 1945.
The official Xinhua News Agency’s website on Friday morning relegated the crisis, which Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said “struck at the very core foundation of our international order,” to a bullet on the site. In its media section, it showed people in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, going about daily life. While state broadcaster CCTV had some on-the-ground coverage, the front page of its app didn’t mention Ukraine. A story by state-backed news site Jiemian, titled “The most difficult day for Ukrainians,” was censored within hours.
Beijing is struggling to articulate a position on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that allows it to join hands with Moscow in opposing U.S. hegemony while still furthering its goal to be seen a responsible global power. President Xi Jinping has yet to comment on his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin’s invasion, which comes weeks after China and Russia released a joint statement declaring their friendship had “no limits.”
“This has happened before when Beijing leaders are themselves following a tricky breaking story and trying to figure out which side to land on,” said Sarah Cook, research director for China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan at Freedom House, a U.S.-based advocacy group. “They are buying time and in a few days, when conditions on the ground in Ukraine become clearer, we may see a more outspoken, consistent message.”
There are still some 6,000 Chinese citizens in Ukraine. Beijing has to work out an evacuation plan, said Maria Repnikova, an assistant professor in global communication at Georgia State University. “We should watch out for what assistance, if any, China would provide to Russia as the sanctions hit,” she added.
At a tense Foreign Ministry press briefing Thursday, spokeswoman Hua Chunying repeatedly sidestepped questions about whether Beijing considered Moscow’s military incursion into Ukrainian territory an invasion. China “didn’t wish to see what happened in Ukraine,” she said, adding that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries must be protected.
Chinese state media has followed suit, largely avoiding language such as “invade” to describe Russia’s attacks, instead calling them a “special military operation.” The state-backed Beijing News earlier this week asked reporters to avoid criticizing Russia or carrying pro-Western voices, according to editorial guidance posted on its social media accounts that was later deleted.
That caution stands in contrast to Chinese social media, where nine out of ten top trending topics on the Twitter-like Weibo were related to the Ukraine crisis Friday morning. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s remarks that he’d been “left alone” by the West topped the trending list, with as many as 490 million views.
Many users replied saying the U.S. wasn’t trustworthy, and called on Taiwanese people to abandon the idea Washington would defend the self-governed island in the wake of an invasion by China, which deems it part of its sovereign territory. One user wrote: “Taiwan compatriots please keep your eyes wide open.”
10:09 a.m. As Russian troops continue their invasion of Ukraine, the question of allyship is repeatedly in debate.
While most countries have condemned Russia for invading Ukraine and threatening its sovereignty, others remain in support of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s actions.
Putin issued a now infamous warning to those standing against him on Thursday, saying consequences for intervening in his invasion of Ukraine would be “greater than any you have faced in history.”
Refusing to back down, U.S. President Joe Biden condemned Russia’s allies and issued his own warning, saying any country in support would be “stained by association.”
Here is a list of countries choosing to support Russia:

10:03 a.m. The International Olympic Committee urged sports bodies Friday to cancel or move all events they plan to hold in Russia and Belarus, and stop using the countries' flags and national anthems.
The request from the Olympic body came after UEFA moved the Champions League final from St. Petersburg to suburban Paris, and after the governing body of skiing and Formula One pulled upcoming races from Russia.
Volleyball and shooting both have world championships scheduled to be held in Russia. There is also a World Cup qualifying playoff match against Poland scheduled for March 24 in Moscow.
Russia breached the Olympic Truce by invading Ukraine on Thursday, only four days after the closing ceremony of the Winter Games in Beijing. Some of the Russian troops entered Ukraine from Belarus, Russia's ally.

9:32 a.m. Popular English-language Ukrainian news outlet, the Kyiv Post, tweeted Thursday that its site has been “under constant cyber attack today from the moment Russia launched its military offensive against Ukraine.”
As Russian bombs and cruise missiles rocked cities across Ukraine early Thursday morning, another front in the long-simmering conflict was erupting. The internet quickly became a battlefield in its own right, with propaganda and disinformation threatening to muddy the water for Americans following the crisis from afar.
Digital disinformation has long been a favorite tactic of the Kremlin’s — as Americans learned via the proliferation of “fake news” during the 2016 presidential election — and the Ukraine crisis is proving to be no exception. Over the last few days, researchers have warned that President Vladimir Putin’s regime is pushing, and will continue to push, false narratives aimed at justifying its aggression.
At least some of those narratives are finding purchase among an American public divided by previous waves of disinformation, said Graham Brookie, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab. “What we see … is not an insignificant amount of organic audience engagement from U.S. citizens that are predisposed to have their previously held beliefs reinforced by Russian disinformation.”
For instance, he said, anti-vaccine groups that are already skeptical of the U.S. government are now primed to disbelieve the official U.S. government narrative around Ukraine.

9:20 a.m. Pope Francis visited the Russian Embassy on Friday to personally “express his concern about the war,” the Vatican said, in an extraordinary, hands-on papal gesture that has no recent precedent.
Usually, popes receive ambassadors and heads of state in the Vatican, and diplomatic protocol would have called for the Vatican foreign minister to summon the ambassador. For Francis, the Vatican head of state, the decision to leave the walled city state and travel a short distance to the Russian embassy to the Holy See was a sign of his anger at Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine and his willingness to appeal personally for an end to it.
Vatican officials said they knew of no such previous papal initiative.
Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni confirmed the visit, and the Vatican said Francis travelled to and from the embassy in a small white car.
“The Holy See press office confirms that the pope went to the Russian Embassy to the Holy See on Via della Conciliazione, clearly to express his concern about the war. He was there for just over a half-hour,” Bruni said.

9:03 a.m. Luxembourg’s foreign minister said Friday that the 27-nation European Union was “very close to agreement” to freezing the assets of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.
Jean Asselborn said before a meeting of EU foreign ministers to discuss Russian sanctions that “I think we are very close to an agreement, that we will find an agreement here,” for sanctions on the two.
“There will be a discussion but I think we agree that Putin and Lavrov, as far as the freezing of assets is concerned, that we will find a consensus here,” he said.
Asselborn said Russia would be hurt by the banks measures.
“We can’t talk everything on this, talk everything down because we don’t have SWIFT on the list at this moment. Once again: the debate about SWIFT is not off the table, it will continue."
EU leaders largely agreed it was too soon to impose a travel ban on Putin and Lavrov because negotiating channels needed to be kept open.
9 a.m. The Kremlin says Russia is ready to send a delegation to Belarus for talks with Ukrainian officials.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to send the delegation in response to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's offer to discuss a non-aligned status for Ukraine.
That indicates Zelenskyy would be willing to negotiate dropping his country’s bid to join NATO, as Russia has demanded.
Before the invasion, the West had rejected the demand. Putin claimed the refusal to discuss keeping Ukraine out of NATO prompted him to order a military action in Ukraine to “demilitarize” it.
8:09 a.m. The Russian military says it has taken control of a strategic airport just outside the Ukrainian capital and cut Kyiv off from the west. The airport in Hostomel has a long runway capable of accommodating heavy transport planes.
7:55 a.m. The Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, was under bombardment on Friday morning, with missile strikes and a rocket crashing into a residential building as the second day of Russia’s military offensive pressed closer to the heart of the government.
Ukrainian forces were battling Russian troops on the outskirts of Kyiv, a city of 2.8 million people, where President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned in a television address that he was “target No. 1” of the Russian advance.
By midmorning, Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said that Russian forces had entered the Obolon district, a few miles north of central Kyiv, and urged people in the capital to stay indoors. In a sign of the potentially chaotic fight that could unfold, the ministry said on Facebook that Kyiv residents should “prepare Molotov cocktails” to deter “the occupier.”
Zelenskyy said that 137 Ukrainians, military and civilian, had been killed in the Russian invasion that began Thursday morning, and that Russian “sabotage groups” had entered the capital with the aim of decapitating Ukraine’s government “by destroying the head of the state.”
7:12 a.m.: Formula One says it's "impossible to hold" Russian Grand Prix in September considering the situation in Ukraine.
7:11 a.m.: U.S. President Joe Biden and his NATO counterparts will seek Friday to reassure member countries on the alliance’s eastern flank that their security is guaranteed as Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine closes in on the capital Kyiv.
With Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealing for help, NATO members ranging from Russia’s neighbor Estonia in the north down around the west of conflict-hit Ukraine to Bulgaria on the Black Sea coast triggered urgent consultations about their security. Only Hungary refrained.
The leaders, meeting via videoconference, plan to take stock of NATO’s own military buildup. The world’s biggest security organization previously had around 5,000 troops stationed in the Baltic countries – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – and Poland, but has significantly beefed up its defenses over the last three months.
“Make no mistake, we will defend every ally against any attack on every inch of NATO territory,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who will chair the summit, told reporters Thursday. “An attack on one ally will trigger a response from the whole alliance.”
6:30 a.m.: Earliier, the Ukrainian Interior Ministry posted details of how to create a molotov cocktail on their official Facebook page.
The post features an image of the bottle, with directions of what to add in, the volume of the container, and where to light the rag inside it.
6:04 a.m.: Russia’s Civil Aviation Authority has banned U.K. flights to and over Russia in retaliation to the British ban on Aeroflot flights.
Rosaviatsiya said that all flights by the U.K. carriers to Russia as well as transit flights are banned starting Friday.
It said the measure was taken in response to the “unfriendly decisions” by the British authorities who banned flights to the U.K. by the Russian flag carrier Aeroflot as part of sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
6:03 a.m.: Europe is facing a massive new migration crisis because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Canada should prepare to provide asylum to those fleeing the violence, says a Canadian security expert.
“This would be a chance for Canada to really, really step up to the plate,” said Michael Bociurkiw, a Canadian in Ukraine who served as the spokesman for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe during the height of tensions following Russia’s annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014.
“Telling Ukrainians: you are welcome in Canada. And, you know, easing of visa rules, temporary stays, that sort of thing.”
Canada has promised to prioritize immigration applications from Ukraine to bring people fleeing the country to safety as quickly as possible.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also announced the creation of a new hotline Thursday, “for anyone at home or abroad with urgent Ukraine-related immigration questions.”
6:01 a.m.: Russia was stripped of hosting the Champions League final by UEFA on Friday with St. Petersburg replaced by Paris after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The men’s final will still be held on May 28 but now at the 80,000-seat Stade de France after the decision by UEFA’s executive committee.
“UEFA wishes to express its thanks and appreciation to French Republic President Emmanuel Macron for his personal support and commitment to have European club football’s most prestigious game moved to France at a time of unparalleled crisis,” European football’s governing body said in a statement. “Together with the French government, UEFA will fully support multi-stakeholder efforts to ensure the provision of rescue for football players and their families in Ukraine who face dire human suffering, destruction and displacement.”
The meeting also decided that Russian and Ukrainian clubs and national teams in UEFA competitions will have to play at neutral venues until further notice.
6 a.m.: Russia pressed its invasion of Ukraine to the outskirts of the capital Friday after unleashing airstrikes on cities and military bases and sending in troops and tanks from three sides in an attack that could rewrite the global post-Cold War security order.
Explosions sounded before dawn in Kyiv and gunfire was later heard near the government quarter as Western leaders scheduled an emergency meeting and Ukraine’s president pleaded for international help to fend off an attack that could topple his democratically elected government, cause massive casualties and ripple out damage to the global economy.
Among the signs that the Ukrainian capital was increasingly threatened, the military said Friday that a group of Russian spies and saboteurs was seen in a district of Kyiv about 5 kilometres (3 miles) north of the city centre. Earlier, the military said that Russian forces had seized two Ukrainian military vehicles and some uniforms and were heading toward the city to try to infiltrate under the guise of being locals.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Kyiv “could well be under siege” in what U.S. officials believe is a brazen attempt by Russian President Vladimir Putin to install his own regime.
5:58 a.m.: Twenty million dollars in U.N. humanitarian funds for Ukraine. A raft of new, stronger sanctions against Russia from Japan, Australia, Taiwan and others. And a cascade of condemnation from the highest levels.
As Russian bombs and troops pounded Ukraine during the invasion’s first full day, world leaders began to fine-tune a response meant to punish the Russian economy and its leaders, including President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.
While there’s an acute awareness that a military intervention isn’t possible, for now, the strength, unity and speed of the financial sanctions — with the striking exception of China, a strong Russian supporter — signal a growing global determination to make Moscow reconsider its attack.
“Japan must clearly show its position that we will never tolerate any attempt to change the status quo by force,” Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters Friday while announcing new punitive measures that included freezing the visas and assets of Russian groups, banks and individuals, and the suspension of shipments of semiconductors and other restricted goods to Russian military-linked organizations.
“Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is an extremely grave development that affects the international order, not only for Europe but also for Asia,” Kishida said.
Countries in Asia and the Pacific have joined the United States, the 27-nation European Union and others in the West in piling on punitive measures against Russian banks and leading companies. The nations have also set up export controls aimed at starving Russia’s industries and military of semiconductors and other high-tech products.
5:56 a.m.: For months, the White House made highly unusual releases of intelligence findings about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s plans to attack Ukraine. Hoping to pre-empt an invasion, it released details of Russian troop buildups and warned repeatedly that a major assault was imminent.
In the end, Putin attacked anyway.
5:56 a.m.: Russia’s expanding invasion of Ukraine has opened a new and perilous chapter in Joe Biden’s presidency, testing his aspirations to defend democracy on a global level and thrusting him into a long-term struggle to restore European security.
It’s a far different trajectory than he imagined when his administration began last year with the goals of countering China’s growing influence in the world and reinvesting at home as the United States tried to turn the page on a deadly pandemic.
Biden talked about forging a “stable and predictable” relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a description that implied America’s focus could then be directed toward other, more pressing challenges.
Now he is confronted with the outbreak of the worst fighting in Europe since World War II. Although U.S. forces are not directly involved, the conflict is testing the limits of American power and Biden’s campaign assurances that he was well positioned to lead the country on the international stage.
Friday 5:51 a.m.: It has been a long time since the threat of using nuclear weapons has been brandished so openly by a world leader, but Vladimir Putin has just done it, warning in a speech that he has the weapons available if anyone dares to military means to try to stop Russia’s takeover of Ukraine.
The threat may have been empty, a mere baring of fangs by the Russian president, but it was noticed. It kindled visions of a nightmarish outcome in which Putin’s ambitions in Ukraine could lead to a nuclear war through accident or miscalculation.
“As for military affairs, even after the dissolution of the USSR and losing a considerable part of its capabilities, today’s Russia remains one of the most powerful nuclear states,” Putin said, in his preinvasion address early Thursday.
“Moreover, it has a certain advantage in several cutting-edge weapons. In this context, there should be no doubt for anyone that any potential aggressor will face defeat and ominous consequences should it directly attack our country.”
By merely suggesting a nuclear response, Putin put into play the disturbing possibility that the current fighting in Ukraine might eventually veer into an atomic confrontation between Russia and the United States.

Full text: Calling it a “cornerstone for the social safety net for workers,” federal Labour Minister Seamus O’Regan will be urging his provincial and territorial counterparts this week to implement 10 paid sick days across the country.
The ministers’ meeting on Friday comes as the federal government has yet to fully deliver on a key Liberal campaign promise of 10 paid sick days for federally regulated workplaces. While legislation creating the policy was passed in December, there is no timeline for its implementation .
“It really seems like a missed opportunity to go into a meeting to convince people to put in place legislated paid sick days when the federal government has inexplicably continued to delay implementation,” said Dr. Monika Dutt, a member of advocacy group Decent Work and Health Network, which has pushed for paid sick leave.
“When the federal government has not done it, I don’t feel it’s a strong argument to the provinces and territories to do it.”
More than 900,000 Canadians — about six per cent of the workforce — are employed in federally regulated workplaces, which include airlines, banks and postal services.
Formal consultations will start next month with employers and unions to eventually develop regulations to implement the policy, O’Regan said in an interview with the Star this week.
“We still have a lot of things to figure out. The system doesn’t necessarily move as quickly as people would like,” he said, referring to the need to update payroll systems and analyze collective agreements. “We know and we feel the urgency.”
With most Canadians working in jobs that fall outside of federal jurisdiction, the government is looking to develop a national action plan for paid sick days across the country.
About 58 per cent of Canadians live in provinces where there are no legislated paid sick days. Some work in jobs where their collective agreements would guarantee a certain number of paid sick days. Some provinces, such as Ontario, also enacted temporary paid sick day programs related to COVID-19.
“Ten is the goal,” O’Regan said, citing the typical number of working days required to isolate when infected with COVID-19 during much of the pandemic. He credited the New Democrats and the labour movement for pushing for paid sick days for years.
“The fact of the matter is these 10 paid sick days don’t just help us with the pandemic, it’s a good idea regardless,” he said.
“Bottom line is, people shouldn’t have to choose between their rent and taking a day off.”
British Columbia recently began requiring most employers to provide workers with five days of paid sick leave. In Ontario, most employees get three days of unpaid, job-protected leave each year, which is similar to policies in several other provinces.
Having spoken privately with most of his counterparts, O’Regan described them as a “pragmatic group of people” who he said understand the argument for 10 paid sick days, but are also confronted with their own challenges in delivering them.
“I want all of us together to speak, elucidate on those challenges, figure out what those are and start moving on them,” he said. “We really see this as a new and essential part of the social safety net for workers in this country.”
A spokesperson for Ontario Labour Minister Monte McNaughton said he has an “excellent working relationship” with O’Regan, and “will continue to work collaboratively with his federal counterparts to improve the lives of the people of Ontario.”
A statement from Quebec Labour Minister Jean Boulet’s office noted paid sick days could have a major impact on small- and medium-sized businesses. Alberta rejected Ottawa’s proposal outright.
“Increasing costs on businesses by legislating paid sick leave would put Alberta’s recovery in jeopardy,” said a statement from the office of Labour Minister Tyler Shandro. “Alberta’s government will not entertain this latest federal government intrusion into provincial jurisdiction.”

PM needs to work on trust in government

Full text: For weeks now, Liberals and Conservatives have accused each other of dividing the country, of playing wedge politics on COVID-19 vaccinations, of pouring gasoline on a fire by either rejecting calls to meet so-called "Freedom Convoy" demonstrators or cheering them on and refusing to ask the blockaders to go home.
Now, as parliamentarians prepare to review the federal government's first invoking of the Emergencies Act, both parties remain entrenched in their corners, unwilling to put water in their wine and seek consensus for the good of the country.
At issue is the makeup of a special committee charged with reviewing the government's actions. When the Emergencies Act was adopted in 1988, supervision of Parliament was a key facet. Parliament was given the ability to revoke a declaration of emergency (a vote in support happened Monday) and it was charged with reviewing the order after the fact.
After Prime Minister Justin Trudeau revoked the emergency measures on Wednesday, saying they were no longer necessary, he thankfully agreed scrutiny should still follow. Unfortunately, there's disagreement on who should provide that scrutiny.
Liberal House Leader Mark Holland says the Tories are making "unreasonable" demands. Conservative House Leader John Brassard calls the government's offer "absurd."
The Liberals want a committee of three Grit MPs, two Conservatives, one Bloc Québécois, one NDP, and four senators, representing the major groups in the Senate, with the Bloc, the NDP and a senator acting as co-chairs.
"The chair would be neither a Liberal, whose government invoked [the] Emergencies Act," Holland tweeted Thursday, "or a Conservative, whose party led the way in supporting protesters."
Brassard said it's disingenuous for the Liberals to suggest the Conservatives' "implied support for the convoy" means their position would be prejudiced.
"This is an oversight committee," he told me. "It's not an opportunity for the government to stack the deck." He believes the Grits' offer gives the government "effectively the majority," though it's unclear what bias most senators hold.
The Tories originally proposed a 16-member committee modelled on another joint committee that would have given them at least a co-chair position. But the Liberals countered with the above offer after securing support from the NDP.
Upset, the Conservatives came back suggesting a five-person committee that met the strict definition of the act: at least one MP from each recognized party, and at least one senator from each party in the Senate that's represented on the committee by an MP.
Because the act wasn't updated after Trudeau came to office in 2015 with a pledge to make the Senate less partisan and more independent, the Conservatives argue this gives them one MP and the only senator, and both committee co-chairs.
"This is the prime minister's problem," Brassard said. "They've had six years to amend the act to reflect the current composition of the Senate, and they haven't done that."
It's unrealistic to suggest the Liberals should have seen this coming, but now the Grits want to put their suggestion up for a vote - one they are likely to win. The Tories don't seem upset by that. Brassard said he welcomes the debate - "I've got a lot to say." The result is more division.
It's discouraging and foreshadows more partisan games on a committee that should set the tone for how reviews are done in the future.
It's imperative the use of the Emergencies Act is not normalized, that this be a rigorous exercise, and frankly, the Liberals should accept an opposition chair. There are worthwhile questions to be probed. Could the government have achieved its objectives through other means? Was the response - freezing bank accounts, for example - proportionate to the threat at hand?
"It's a bit ridiculous at the moment," the Bloc press secretary, Julien Coulombe-Bonnafous, told me. "What we are hoping for is a consensus. That this isn't adopted by a vote after a debate, that everyone agrees together who the chair will be, and that it be as neutral as possible."
What shook many Canadians to the core during the convoy's occupation of Ottawa was the perceived breakdown of government institutions. The police weren't seen to do their job, nor was the province of Ontario. The federal government seemed to act late, and then perhaps too heavy-handedly. Now that order is restored, confidence also needs to be restored. The best way for that to happen is a truly transparent and neutral process: a full public inquiry, and a committee process free of partisan bickering.
At least we now know that all the regulations and proclamations made under the Emergencies Act were published, which means the parliamentary committee has few reasons to meet behind closed doors.

Full text: The Conservatives rejected a government proposal on Thursday for the makeup of the Emergencies Act oversight committee, arguing it would give the minority Liberals a "working majority."
The government is proposing that seven MPs (three Liberals, two Conservatives, one Bloc Québécois and one New Democrat) sit on a joint House-Senate committee that will have to review the exercise of powers under the Emergencies Act.
The federal government triggered the never-before-used act on Feb. 14 in response to the so-called Freedom Convoy protests gridlocking the capital city's downtown core and blockades snarling key border crossings.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday declared an end to the public order emergency, promising - as is required under the act - to strike a committee overseeing the government's actions and launch an inquiry into why the measure was needed in the first place.
The Liberals have also proposed that four senators, one from each Senate group, should sit on the committee, with three co-chairs: one senator and MPs from the Bloc and NDP.
"The chair would be neither a Liberal, whose government invoked Emergencies Act, nor a Conservative, whose party led the way in supporting protesters," said Government House Leader Mark Holland in a statement Thursday.
The Conservatives blasted the proposal on Thursday, saying it would give the Liberals "a working majority," given that the NDP voted with the Liberals to support the unprecedented use of the act in the House of Commons.
They said the proposal would also give the Senate a "disproportionate role," and that the co-chair position would go to a "fourth party that sees itself as an extension of the government."
Opposition House Leader John Brassard and Deputy Opposition Leader Luc Berthold said in a statement that traditionally, an oversight committee would be chaired by the Official Opposition, which is the Conservatives.
They said the party had delivered a "viable alternative" to the committee's membership, but did not provide specifics.
"Conservatives refuse to support this balanced proposal," Holland said. "
They have insisted from the start that they co-chair and they are now demanding that both co-chairs be Conservative."
He said the government intends to submit its proposal to a vote next week when the House of Commons returns.
NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, whose party supports the proposal, agreed Thursday that the committee should be opposition-led.
"That way there can be true accountability and full transparency," Singh told reporters. "And that means asking questions around (whether it was) required, the scope of the powers used, and its effectiveness."
The party's house leader, Peter Julian, told the Star in a statement that committee work must get underway quickly.
"We have urged all parties to work together to strike the committee immediately, and we have proposed that the committee be as small and nimble as possible," he said.
"It's disappointing to see the Conservatives seemingly want to delay this."
The debate over a review of the act's invocation happened on the same day that Ottawa's interim police chief Steve Bell said the federal act, along with the declarations of states of emergency at the municipal and provincial levels, were "absolutely beneficial" in clearing out the protests.
"The removal yesterday of that act created, initially, some dialogue and concern for us in terms of how we would manage the situation through the weekend," he said at a meeting of the Ottawa Police Services board Thursday morning.
Bell said the city still has assurances that the RCMP and the OPP will remain on the ground "until there's nothing left" of the demonstration.
"We also have commitments from other municipal police agencies, particularly as it relates to public order capacities," he told the board. "The ability for them to operate in our city is maintained and is lawful, even without the assistance of emergency act."
Under the Emergencies Act, the parliamentary committee's members must include at least one member from each party in the House of Commons that has 12 or more MPs. The committee must also include at least one senator from each party in the Senate that is represented on the committee by a member of the House.
The Senate was divided along party lines when the act was passed in 1988, but the Conservatives are now the only party that has affiliated members in the upper chamber.
The government's motion recognizes this new dynamic by proposing that a senator from each of the four Senate groups, including the Conservatives, sit on the committee.
Concerns remain about what kind of information the committee will have access to in order to do its job. It emerged during the Senate debate this week on the declaration of emergency that committee members would not have access to confidential security information.
"This issue of intelligence gathering and sharing should be at the heart of our parliamentary review," Nunavut Sen. Dennis Patterson told the Star in an interview Thursday.
"How can these measures meant to serve as checks and balances do the job if they aren't fully informed?"

Full text: Calling it a "cornerstone for the social safety net for workers," federal Labour Minister Seamus O'Regan will be urging his provincial and territorial counterparts this week to implement 10 paid sick days across the country.
The ministers' meeting on Friday comes as the federal government has yet to fully deliver on a key Liberal campaign promise of 10 paid sick days for federally regulated workplaces. While legislation creating the policy was passed in December, there is no timeline for its implementation.
"It really seems like a missed opportunity to go into a meeting to convince people to put in place legislated paid sick days when the federal government has inexplicably continued to delay implementation," said Dr. Monika Dutt, a member of advocacy group Decent Work and Health Network, which has pushed for paid sick leave.
"When the federal government has not done it, I don't feel it's a strong argument to the provinces and territories to do it."
More than 900,000 Canadians - about six per cent of the workforce - are employed in federally regulated workplaces, which include airlines, banks and postal services.
Formal consultations will start next month with employers and unions to eventually develop regulations to implement the policy, O'Regan said in an interview with the Star this week.
"We still have a lot of things to figure out. The system doesn't necessarily move as quickly as people would like," he said, referring to the need to update payroll systems and analyze collective agreements.
With most Canadians working in jobs that fall outside of federal jurisdiction, the government is looking to develop a national action plan for paid sick days across the country.
About 58 per cent of Canadians live in provinces where there are no legislated paid sick days. Some work in jobs where their collective agreements would guarantee a certain number of paid sick days. Some provinces, such as Ontario, also enacted temporary paid sick day programs related to COVID-19.
"Ten is the goal," O'Regan said, citing the typical number of working days required to isolate when infected with COVID-19 during much of the pandemic. He credited the New Democrats and the labour movement for pushing for paid sick days for years.
British Columbia recently began requiring most employers to provide workers with five days of paid sick leave. In Ontario, most employees get three days of unpaid, job-protected leave each year, which is similar to policies in several other provinces.
A spokesperson for Ontario Labour Minister Monte McNaughton said he has an "excellent working relationship" with O'Regan, and "will continue to work collaboratively with his federal counterparts to improve the lives of the people of Ontario."
A statement from Quebec Labour Minister Jean Boulet's office noted paid sick days could have a major impact on small- and medium-sized businesses. Alberta rejected Ottawa's proposal outright.

Martin Regg Cohn: Why is Andrea Horwath picking the same lane as Doug Ford?

Full text: Four years ago Doug Ford promised us buck-a-beer.
Now, he is back to buying ballots with baubles. The bottles of beer are long forgotten — cheap suds in corner stores was a memorable slogan but an undeliverable promise.
Look instead to new pocketbook pitches and press lines from the premier on the campaign trail:
Road tolls? Removed.
License renewals? Rebated.
It’s all about the appeal of affordability .
If that sounds like the familiar Progressive Conservative playbook, you’re right. Now, the New Democratic Party has learned the lesson of Ford’s 2018 election victory:
If political leftists can’t beat the right-wing premier at his own game, they might as well join him in cutting government revenues. Which is why the loudest victory lap, after Ford’s Tories rescinded tolls in Durham, came from NDP Leader Andrea Horwath.
“Today is a victory,” Horwath exulted after Ford’s announcement, congratulating her Oshawa MPP Jennifer French — a New Democrat facing a tough re-election battle against the Tories — and the local activists she teamed up with to “free the 412 and 418” highways. Never mind that Bob Rae’s NDP government pioneered toll roads with Highway 407 in the 1990s, today’s New Democrats are firmly opposed.
Next, Horwath announced she was going along with Ford’s campaign-style announcement Tuesday to remove the annual license plate renewal fee. It wasn’t an NDP priority, she pointed out — small beer, perhaps — yet Horwath pointedly refused to say how she would make up the money to pay for her party’s other priorities.
While many will surely be pleased that the pesky payments are now history, Ford’s decision will cost the treasury an estimated $1 billion yearly. It’s hardly surprising that the tax-fighting Tories are keen to reduce revenues (and then squeeze services when an inevitable cash crunch arises).
But why would the second-place NDP, which is campaigning hard to form Ontario’s next government, be auditioning for the role of tax-fighters?
“When it comes to the amount of money that’s being refunded, all of those pieces, I’m not particularly opposed to it,” Horwath told reporters.
Yet in the same breath, she restated NDP priorities to spend more on education, housing, health care, long-term care and child care. Where would that money come from?
If Horwath doesn’t have a ready answer — like, for example, that the pandemic reminded Ontarians of the vital importance of funding health care and other essential public services — Ford surely does:
“We believe hardworking Ontarians know the value of a dollar, and the best place for your money is in your pocket, not the government’s pocket,” the premier proclaimed Tuesday.
At a 9 a.m. photo-op in vote-rich Richmond Hill — during which he snubbed the first sitting of the legislature since the onset of the Omicron wave more than two months ago — Ford mused about the economics of pocketbook politics. The premier didn’t just waive future license fees, he promised rebate cheques for those who have paid for renewals over the past two years — which means envelopes will land on your doorstep, conveniently, just a few weeks before the June 2 vote:
“It’s actually your money, it’s everyone’s money out there, it’s not the government’s money— we’re just putting that back into your pocket. And it’s about affordability.”
Ah, affordability. Ford boasted that reducing renewals will save the average driver $120 a year (northerners pay half that).
Admittedly, the annual fee might be a nuisance that could easily be made up elsewhere — higher gas taxes, for example. But a hardship for hardworking voters?
In fact, the $120 annual renewal fee amounts to a mere 0.24 per cent of the total outlay for the average new car, which now exceeds $50,000. Of course, if your family own two cars, you’ll save up to $240 a year — but that means you can also afford to own and operate two vehicles.
Why then is Horwath’s NDP now on the same page as Ford’s Tories on user fees? For one thing, it’s a good way for the two rival parties to team up against the hated Liberals led by Steven Del Duca, who was transportation minister when that toll road was opened in Durham.
“We’re getting rid of tolls that were brought in by the last Liberal government on Highways 412 and 418,” Ford stressed (while dodging questions about why his government has publicly defended those tolls until now).
As for Del Duca’s Liberals, they have been lying low, lest they get caught out for imposing tolls and fees in power only to have second thoughts now that they’re in opposition. That hasn’t stopped the Liberals from lapsing into the same “affordability” lines used by the NDP and Tories.
Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner, however, was having none of it. After listening to Horwath evade reporters’ questions on where she would make up the money, Tuesday, he marched up to the microphone to call out Ford — and the other leaders:
Schreiner condemned the fee cut as a “billion-dollar election boondoggle that means less money for health care, less money for education, less money for affordable housing. I absolutely oppose what the premier is doing.”
The problem, Schreiner added, is that his rivals are dancing around the cost implications by “playing footsie with this election gimmick.”
Footsie indeed. The flip side of affordability is authenticity. It’s hard to promise cuts while also pledging to maintain services and still keep a straight face.

Full text: Ottawa police are looking into controversial Twitter activity from Independent MPP Randy Hillier, who urged supporters of the so-called “Freedom Convoy” to “keep calling” emergency phone lines in the nation’s capital as the protest was being dispersed.
The revelation follows a move by Ontario’s legislature to again censure the former Progressive Conservative for “conduct that is inappropriate and unbecoming of a member.”
“We are aware of the claims and Ottawa police is reviewing the social media posts,” Const. Paramjit Singh said Wednesday in a statement to the Star.
At Queen’s Park, Government House Leader Paul Calandra said the latest censure of Hillier (Lanark-Frontenac-Kingston) means he will not be allowed to rise and make remarks in the legislature unless he apologizes.
“In the very, very near future he’ll have the opportunity to have the attention of the legislature for a bill of his choosing and we want to make sure that he understands that the speaker has the authority to not recognize him,” Calandra said.
“We as a legislature condemn unanimously ... what he has written. We condemn his behaviour,” added Calandra. “We’re not going to give him a legislative platform to express opinions that are completely off-step.”
It was not immediately clear if Hillier intends to use his pending time slot to propose a private member’s bill, or what it might be. Hillier did not reply to a request for comment from the Star on Wednesday.
A Saturday evening Twitter post from the eastern Ontario MPP commented on an Ottawa police tweet asking people to “stop calling critical emergency and operational phone lines to express displeasure about the police action” as officers were clearing out trucks and protesters from the downtown area near Parliament Hill.
Hillier retweeted it, telling his 56,000 followers: “Keep calling in a democracy expressing yourself is a fundamental freedom #FreedomConvoy2022.”
It was the latest in a series of social media posts that have put Hillier — who Premier Doug Ford ejected from the PC caucus in 2019 — under close scrutiny. They include calling federal Transport Minister Omar Alghabra, who is Muslim, a “terrorist” in January and posting information about Ontarians whom he wrongly claimed had died from COVID-19 vaccinations. He was censured for that in October .
Hillier told the Star on Tuesday that “there was no mention of 911” in his weekend tweet, adding, “I don’t generally apologize for other people’s mistakes or wrongful attributions.”
But Solicitor General Sylvia Jones and New Democrat MPP Joel Harden (Ottawa Centre) took issue with Hillier’s assertion that he was not implying his supporters should call 911.
“I shudder to think about the impact of a first responder diverted from an actual emergency by a vexatious 911 call,” said Harden, who wrote to Ontario’s integrity commissioner asking him to examine Hillier’s conduct during the pandemic.
Jones said she regrets “a member of this parliamentary legislature was encouraging people to block 911 calls.”
Calandra said Hillier remains entitled to vote in the legislature and noted members can be expelled if they are charged and convicted with criminal offences.
“It hasn’t risen to the level where the house could consider an expulsion at this point,” he said.
Some convoy participants are facing mischief and other charges.

Doug Ford accused of election ploy with proposal to move Ontario's budget

Full text: The Ford government is proposing the Ontario budget deadline be pushed back until the end of April — a move opposition critics are calling a campaign tactic given the provincial election is on June 2.
Moving the budget deadline to April 30 is “just so we can have a real feel, to know where our finances are after March 31,” which is the end of the current fiscal year, said Nina Tangri, associate minister of small business and red tape reduction.
“We’re at the point now where we are starting to withdraw or move out of the COVID restrictions, the economy is starting to open up again, the supports that had been coming from the federal government are ending and some of those other COVID supports that we had in place are also coming to an end,” said Government House Leader Paul Calandra.
“I think a little bit more time to ensure that we have an accurate reflection of where we are and where we’re going is really the impetus behind it.”
But critics said the change will leave municipalities and community organizations in limbo for up to a month. Tangri said the province is already working with them.
NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said Premier Doug Ford should instead be presenting the budget early “to start solving the problems that people are facing. Instead, he’s paying attention to his own political benefit.”
She called the government’s explanation for the move “balderdash … the games the government is playing around budget timing and budget numbers is shameful.”
Tangri’s omnibus bill, the Fewer Fees, Better Services Act , introduced Tuesday , would also eliminate licence plate sticker renewal fees — which run as high as $120 in parts of the province — and reimburse Ontario drivers for any they have paid since March 2020, remove tolls from Highways 412 and 418 in Durham Region as well as cut the size of the board of governors at the financially troubled Laurentian University in Sudbury by more than a third.
It would also amend the Ford government’s own 2019 legislation that set a March 31 due date for the yearly budget — an act that also imposes a financial penalty on the premier and finance minister for missing that deadline.
In 2020, because of the pandemic, a full budget was not delivered in time and both Premier Doug Ford and then-finance minister Rod Phillips paid fines equal to 10 per cent of their cabinet top-up pay, or $9,200 and $4,900 respectively.
Liberal MPP Mitzie Hunter, a member of the standing committee on finance and economic affairs, said the government was asked for more consultation on the budget “and we were shut down.”
Now, she added, “the government is going to punt the date four weeks later because it’s convenient to Doug Ford and his electioneering. I don’t see how this helps business, how it helps the economy.”
Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner said the delay will only upset “municipalities, social service agencies, non-profits and other community organizations that rely on government funding that now have to wait an additional month to understand what the provincial budget is going to be.”
The government, he added, “is going to use it as an election document to launch their election and that’s why they want to delay as long as possible.”
He also said the premier and Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy “should uphold the spirit of the law they brought in” and pay a fine.
Liberal MPP John Fraser, former interim leader of the party, said “putting it up to April 30 is literally right on top of writ day” and there may not be time to properly debate or even pass it.

Full text: The Ontario Liberals have never been here before — only seven seats in the legislature, short on cash, constantly trailing in the polls, and led by a guy who most people couldn’t pick out in a grocery-store lineup.
To top it off, their former leader, Kathleen Wynne, admits she “wrecked the Liberal party” when the party suffered its worst defeat ever in 2018.
With less than 100 days to go before the June 2 provincial election, the outlook for party leader Steven Del Duca and the struggling Liberals looks grim.
Indeed, party insiders concede their best-case scenario, at least at this moment, is to hold Doug Ford to a minority government and have the Liberals finish ahead of the New Democrats.
While the election won’t officially start until late April, the campaigns are already well under way. Dueling ad campaigns will start in earnest in the coming days and the parties have already started to trickle out campaign promises, such as Ford’s billion-dollar pledge this week to give rebates for vehicle license renewal fees and to drop tolls on Highways 412 and 418 in Durham Region.
But can Del Duca pull off a miracle? Can he lead the Liberals from third place to first in a single election? More importantly, how can he step up his game?
Long-time Liberal strategists and campaign organizers interviewed in recent days provide a few starting ideas:
1. Show energy: Del Duca concedes he lacks charisma, but he needs to be dynamic, especially in the critical first 10 days of the campaign when he can make an impression on voters and get them to say to themselves, “Gee, this guy is not as bad as I thought.”
2. Hire an image consultant: One veteran organizer says Del Duca is seen as “just a guy, not a leader.” To counter that, it’s time the party brought in an image consultant, ditch the thick-framed glasses, be seen exercising and getting fit. Both Stephen Harper and Dalton McGuinty got some expert advice years ago and it worked to a good measure for both.
3. Highlight the team: Del Duca needs to show off his top new candidates, those who could be ministers of finance, education and health. In short, the Liberals need to be seen as having a competent team ready to govern, ready to win — not seen as a party willing to settle for a two-election path.
4. Go big on three issues: Make keeping schools open and properly funded, increasing hospital capacities and improving long-term care the centrepiece of the campaign.
5. Inspire voters: The people of Ontario are exhausted, they’re depressed and they’re worried. They want to get to the other side of this COVID nightmare, as quickly and safely as possible. Be real. Be honest. Let voters know there are better days ahead.
6. Respect all voters, not just urban progressives: Del Duca needs to convince all voters that the Liberal have their backs, not just those who live in major cities or who hold decent jobs or went to university, but also those who work at low-wage jobs or who live in rural and small-town Ontario. Being told, for example, that climate change is one of your top issues doesn’t count much when you’re trying to pay the rent or buy groceries at the end of each month.
7. Be wary of tilting too far to the left: Like it or not, there’s a growing backlash — not just among right-wingers — to many “politically correct” initiatives, such as mandatory diversity awareness training and changing names of public institutions, such as Ryerson University, because of perceived ties to colonialism and racism.
It’s a lot for Del Duca to do, but occasionally miracles do happen.

Full text: The latest on Russia and Ukraine from Canada and around the world Thursday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available .
9:36 p.m. Anonymous, an international hacker group, declared “cyber war” against the Russian government.
In a tweet Thursday night , the group claimed responsibility for taking down Russian state media website RT . The website is back online after temporarily being disabled.
The cyberattack also targeted the websites of the Russian government, the Kremlin, the Duma and Ministry of Defence.
“There is an inevitability that the private sector will most likely be affected too,” Anonymous said in a statement.
8:00 p.m. The Trudeau government blasted Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a grave threat to the world order Canadians fought and died to create, as it laid out new and more aggressive sanctions, and warned more penalties could cut Russia out of the global financial system and take direct aim at President Vladimir Putin.
Canada, acting in concert with the United States, United Kingdom, and other European and G7 allies, announced its second round of sanctions this week in response to what Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called “the greatest threat to European stability” since the Second World War: a “horrific, unprovoked attack” on a sovereign country that violated international law and spawned human suffering as missiles fell on Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital.
Ottawa outlined moves to penalize 31 individuals and 27 banks and entities all connected to Russia’s ruling elite, to curb about $750 million in Canadian exports particularly of aerospace, IT and mineral shipments to Russia, and to bar any dealings with several Russian financial institutions.
Read the full story from the Star’s Tonda MacCharles and Alex Ballingall.
7:45 p.m. From Allan Woods , the Star’s special correspondent in Moscow: Russian embassy in Canada says Russia has been expressing concern about NATO enlargement for 20 years. “All our efforts have been put on the back burner or haughtily ridiculed,” an embassy statement read.
The “evolved political military situation” and NATO posturing in Europe “created a clear and immediate danger for Russia that could not have been mitigated by any other means than those Russia has to use today,” the embassy continued.
However, the embassy states "the road to peace remains open. And Russia remains open to a meaningful dialogue” to develop a new security arrangement in Europe and across the Atlantic.
7:30 p.m. Even the smallest act of defiance in Russia takes a giant dose of courage.
That is the way it was in Soviet times. And that is the way it was the day that Russia invaded Ukraine .
A day that began before the sun rose with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s paranoid justification for war: an attack by the West against Russia was a certainty unless Russia brought to bloody completion the brutal military buildup on Ukraine’s borders.
“You and I,” he said, “simply have not been left with any other opportunity to protect Russia, our people, except for the one that we will be forced to use today.”
The Star’s Allan Woods reports from Moscow.
6:59 p.m. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky says Russian forces killed 137 Ukrainians and injured 316 more in the first day of attack, according to local media.
Of the 137 killed, 10 were officers.
6:44 p.m. “It’s going to be a cold day for Russia,” U.S. President Joe Biden said Thursday afternoon at the White House, talking about the expected long-term effects of new sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin.
It would be fair to say that it was a bitterly cold day all around. A day when, as Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said, “we woke up to a changed world.” A day in which we witnessed a massive invasion of the kind not seen in the developed world in generations — an unprovoked territorial war of naked aggression launched by Russia, the largest country in Europe, against Ukraine, the second largest, in explosive waves of destruction from the east and the north and the south, by land and by sea and by air.
“We haven’t seen a conventional move like this, nation-state to nation-state, since World War II,” a U.S. Defense Department official told reporters , predicting that the aim of Russia’s invasion appeared to be taking over Ukraine, “decapitating the government” and installing its own regime.
Read the full story from the Star’s Edward Keenan.
6:36 p.m. Don’t expect Canadian sanctions to bring Russia’s economy to its knees.
There simply isn’t enough trade between the two countries for even broad sanctions to really hurt Russia’s economy, business and trade experts say.
“Our trade relationship with Russia is negligible. It’s about half a per cent. By the same token, the impact of Canadian sanctions are also negligible if we just look at trade,” said Mark Manger, an associate professor at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs.
The Star’s Josh Rubin has the rest.
6:23 p.m. World leaders Thursday condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine as “barbaric” and quickly slapped heavy sanctions on the Russian economy, President Vladimir Putin's inner circle and many of the country's oligarchs.
“Putin chose this war, and now he and his country will bear the consequences,” U.S. President Joe Biden declared.
In near-unison, the United States, the 27-nation European Union and other Western allies announced a round of punitive measures against Russian banks and leading companies and imposed export controls aimed at starving the country's industries and military of semiconductors and other high-tech products.
From the U.S. to Western Europe and Japan, South Korea and Australia, nations lined up to denounce the Kremlin as the outbreak of fighting raised fears about the shape of Europe to come. The invasion initially sent stocks slumping and oil prices surging on fears of higher costs for food and fuel.
6:15 p.m. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has ordered a full military mobilization to counter the Russian invasion.
In a decree issued Thursday, he said the the mobilization would last 90 days.
He tasked the military’s general staff with determining the number of people eligible for service and the number of reservists as well as the order of the call-up. The president’s cabinet has been tasked with allocating money for the mobilization.
5:27 p.m. Yellow and blue flags flew in cities across Canada on Thursday as Ukrainian Canadians organized demonstrations to denounce Russia's attack on Ukraine and urged Ottawa to act swiftly to defend their homeland.
Several Canadian cities, including Calgary and Montreal, said they would fly the Ukrainian flag over municipal buildings. Demonstrations were also planned in Toronto, Vancouver and Edmonton to denounce the Russian military strike.
5:10 p.m. From Allan Woods , the Star’s special correspondent in Moscow: More than 1,700 people have been detained at dozens of anti-war rallies in cities across Russia, according to OVD-Info, an organisation that monitors political persecution in the region.
4:10 p.m. Canadians can expect to pay more at the pump as Russia's attack on Ukraine puts even greater pressure on an already surging oil price environment.
Russia’s attack on Ukraine is putting even greater pressure on an already surging oil price environment and that will cost Canadians more at the pump.
Roger McKnight, chief petroleum analyst at En-Pro International Inc. expects gas prices across the country to rise approximately five cents per litre this weekend.
"If you are only filling up once a week or that sort of thing, get anything in your tank that you can before Saturday," McKnight said on Thursday. "But if you’re a daily filler, there’s really not much you can do."
4 p.m. Shocked Russians turned out by the thousands Thursday to decry their country's invasion of Ukraine as emotional calls for protests grew on social media. Some 1,702 people in 53 Russian cities were detained, at least 940 of them in Moscow.
Hundreds of posts came pouring in condemning Moscow’s most aggressive actions since the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Vladimir Putin called the attack a “special military operation” to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine from “genocide” — a false claim the U.S. had predicted would be a pretext for invasion, and which many Russians roundly rejected.
Tatyana Usmanova, an opposition activist in Moscow, wrote on Facebook that she thought she was dreaming when she awoke at 5:30 a.m. to the news, which she called “a disgrace that will be forever with us now.”
“I want to ask Ukrainians for forgiveness. We didn’t vote for those who unleashed the war,” she said.
As sirens blasted in Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, and large explosions were heard there and in other cities, Russians were signing open letters and online petitions demanding the Kremlin halt the assault, which Ukrainian forces reported had killed more than 40 soldiers and wounded dozens.
“Public opinion is in shock, people are in shock,” political analyst Abbas Gallyamov told The Associated Press.
One petition, started by a prominent human rights advocate, Lev Ponomavyov, garnered over 150,000 signatures within several hours and 289,000 by the end of the day. More than 250 journalists put their names on an open letter decrying the aggression. Another one was signed by some 250 scientists, while 194 municipal council members in Moscow and other cities signed a third.
“I’m worried about the people very much, I’m worried to tears,” said Zoya Vorobey, a resident of Korolyov, a town outside Moscow, her voice cracking. “I’ve been watching television since this morning, every minute, to see if anything changes. Unfortunately, nothing.”
Several Russian celebrities and public figures, including some working for state TV, spoke out against the attack. Yelena Kovalskaya, director of a state-funded Moscow theater, announced on Facebook she was quitting her job, saying “it's impossible to work for a killer and get paid by him.”
"I know that right now many of you feel desperation, helplessness, shame over Vladimir Putin's attack on the friendly nation of Ukraine. But I urge you not to despair," human rights activist Marina Litvinovich said in a video statement on Facebook, calling for mass protests Thursday evening.
“We, the Russian people, are against the war Putin has unleashed. We don't support this war, it is being waged not on our behalf,” Litvinovich said.
But the authorities were having none of that.
In Moscow and other cities, they moved swiftly to crack down on critical voices. Litvinovich was detained outside of her residence shortly after posting the protest call. OVD-Info, a rights group that tracks political arrests, reported that 1,702 people in 53 cities had been detained by Thursday evening, at least 940 of them in Moscow.
Russia's Investigative Committee issued a warning Thursday afternoon reminding Russians that unauthorized protests are against the law.
Roskomnadzor, state communications and media watchdog, demanded that Russian media use “information and data they get only from official Russian sources.” Some media reported that employees of certain state-funded companies were instructed not to comment publicly on the events in Ukraine.
Human rights advocates warned of a new wave of repression on dissent.
“There will be new (criminal) cases involving subverters, spies, treason, prosecution for antiwar protests, there will be detentions of journalists and bloggers, those who authored critical posts on social media, bans on investigations of the situation in the army and so on," prominent human rights advocate Pavel Chikov wrote on Facebook.
"It is hard to say how big this new wave will be, given that everything has been suppressed already.”
Despite the pressure from the authorities, more than 1,000 people gathered in the center of Moscow Thursday evening, chanting “No to war!” as passing cars honked their horns.
Hundreds also took to the streets in St. Petersburg and dozens in Yekaterinburg.
“This is the most shameful and terrible day in my life. I even was not able to go to work. My country is an aggressor. I hate Putin. What else should be done to make people open their eyes?" Yekaterina Kuznetsova, 40-year-old engineer who joined the demonstration in St. Petersburg, told the AP.
Russia's official line in the meantime remained intransigent. Speaker of the upper house of parliament, Valentina Matviyenko charged that those who spoke out against the attack were only caring about their “momentary problems.”
State TV painted the attack in line with what Putin said in his televised address announcing it.
Russia 1 TV host Olga Skabeyeva called it an effort “to protect people in Donbas from a Nazi regime" and said it was “without exaggeration, a crucial junction in history.”
3:55 p.m. Ukraine’s Health Minister Viktor Lyashko says 57 Ukrainians have been killed as a result of the Russian invasion, and 169 more were wounded.
Lyashko also said Thursday that Ukraine’s authorities are repurposing the country’s health care facilities to make room for those who need medical assistance because of the hostilities.
3:49 p.m. “I love you, I’m sorry. May God save you.”
That was the text Khrystyna Riazantseva saw when she woke up Thursday morning. It was a message from her mom, who lives in Tal’ne, a small town in central Ukraine.
She was startled by the unexpected message. Riazantseva immediately called her mother, more than 7,000 kilometres away, to ask what was happening. Her mother broke the news: the war had just started.
Riazantseva, a Toronto-based photographer, is one of thousands of Ukrainian-Canadians who woke up to the news that Russia had launched a wide-ranging attack on Ukraine . In less than 24 hours, the “special military operation,” as Russian President Vladimir Putin described it, had killed more than 40 Ukrainian soldiers and left dozens wounded.
Explosions could be heard in cities across Ukraine, including the capital, Kyiv. Officials in the country also said they have lost control of the Chernobyl nuclear site.
Riazantseva has been following the situation closely on social media.
Read the full story here by the Star’s Joshua Chong and Alex McKeen.
3:39 p.m. Russia’s attack on Ukraine is putting even greater pressure on an already surging oil price environment and that will cost Canadians more at the pump.
Roger McKnight, chief petroleum analyst at En-Pro International Inc. expects gas prices across the country will rise five cents per litre on Saturday.
He says drivers who fill up occasionally have hours to avoid extra costs but there’s not much that can be done for those who fill up daily.
The high demand for oil combined with a shortage of supply have been pushing oil prices, and consequently, gas prices up for weeks.
The benchmark West Texas Intermediate price is sitting at US$96 per barrel after briefly trading above US$100 per barrel this morning. Brent Crude has fallen slightly to US$103 a barrel, after topping US$105 a barrel earlier — the first time since 2014.
Even if U.S. President Joe Biden attempts to intervene to calm oil prices the situation could get worse, according to McKnight.
“OPEC+ is really Saudi Arabia and Russia together and if President Biden puts pressure on Saudi Arabia to get more crude into the system to lower prices, that’s just going to upset Russia even further and they may even shut down supply completely,” McKnight says.
3:28 p.m. European Union leaders have agreed to impose sanctions against Russia that will have “massive and severe consequences.”
During an emergency summit Thursday to condemn the invasion of Ukraine, the 27 member countries' leaders approved punitive measures against Russia’s financial, energy and transport sectors and restrictions on exports and financing. They also added more Russian individuals to its earlier sanctions list.
The sanctions must still be legally approved and published before they become effective.
The EU leaders say they also want to draw up sanctions against Belarus because of its close links to Russia.
3:25 p.m. For those that haven’t been following closely up to now, here’s a primer on the situation in Ukraine.
Canadians woke Thursday morning to the news that, after a weeks-long military buildup at the border, Russian troops had invaded Ukraine.
For weeks, tensions — already high after the 2014 Crimean occupation by Russia — have grown in Ukraine as Russian troops rattled their sabres at their border.
Diplomacy and economic sanctions from the West failed to defuse the situation. Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded assurances that Ukraine would not join NATO, though there seemed to be little indication that that was imminent.
On Thursday, missiles began raining down on Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, and Russian troops poured into the country by land, sea and air from the north, east and south. Sirens blared across Kyiv, and the streets were clogged with traffic as residents tried to flee the city.

2:52 p.m. It was among the most worrying developments on an already shocking day, as Russia invaded Ukraine on Thursday: warfare at the Chernobyl nuclear plant, where radioactivity is still leaking from history’s worst nuclear disaster 36 years ago.
Russian forces took control over the site after a fierce battle with Ukrainian national guards protecting the decommissioned plant, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak told The Associated Press. The condition of the plant’s facilities, a confinement shelter and a repository for nuclear waste is unknown, he said.
An official familiar with current assessments said Russian shelling hit a radioactive waste repository at Chernobyl, and an increase in radiation levels was reported. The increase could not be immediately corroborated.
A senior American intelligence official said the U.S. believes Russian forces at Chernobyl were aiming to push to Kyiv, about 130 kilometers (80 miles) south of the plant, to try to link with other Russian forces throughout Ukraine. The officials were not authorized to be publicly named discussing the sensitive matter.
The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, a 2,600-square-kilometer (1,000-square-mile) zone of forest surrounding the shuttered plant, lies between the Belarus-Ukraine border and the Ukrainian capital.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukrainian officers fought to defend it, “so that the tragedy of 1986 will not be repeated.” He called it a “declaration of war against the whole of Europe.”
Adviser Podolyak said that after an “absolutely senseless attack ... it is impossible to say that the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is safe.” He warned that Russian authorities could blame Ukraine for damage to the site or stage provocations from there.
Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Anton Herashenko warned that any attack on the waste repository could send radioactive dust over “the territory of Ukraine, Belarus and countries of the EU.”
Russian officials, who have revealed little of their operations in Ukraine and not revealed their goals, did not publicly comment on the battle.
The International Atomic Energy Agency said it is following the situation in Ukraine “with grave concern” and appealed for maximum restraint to avoid any action that may put Ukraine's nuclear facilities at risk.
Rafael Mariano Grossi, the IAEA's general director, said Ukraine has informed the Vienna-based agency that ”unidentified armed forces” have taken control of all facilities at the plant and that there had been no casualties or destruction at the industrial site. Grossi said it is "of vital importance that the safe and secure operations of the nuclear facilities in that zone should not be affected or disrupted in any way.''
Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, said, “I can’t imagine how it would be in Russia’s interest to allow any facilities at Chernobyl to be damaged."
In an interview, Lyman said he is most worried about spent fuel stored at the site, which has not been active since 2000. If the power to cooling pumps is disrupted or fuel-storage tanks are damaged, the results could be catastrophic, he said.
Reactor No. 4 at the power plant exploded and caught fire deep in the night on April 26, 1986, shattering the building and spewing radioactive material high into the sky.
Soviet authorities made the catastrophe even worse by failing to tell the public what had happened, angering European governments and the Soviet people. The 2 million residents of Kyiv weren’t informed despite the fallout danger, and the world learned of the disaster only after heightened radiation was detected in Sweden.
The building containing the exploded reactor was covered in 2017 by an enormous shelter aimed at containing radiation still leaking from the accident. Robots inside the shelter work to dismantle the destroyed reactor and gather up the radioactive waste.
It's expected to take until 2064 to finish dismantling the reactors. Ukraine decided to use the deserted zone as the site for its centralized storage facility for spent fuel from the country’s other remaining nuclear power plants.
Germany’s vice chancellor and economy minister, Robert Habeck, told The Associated Press that Russia would not need to obtain nuclear material from Chernobyl if it wanted to use it for any purpose, because it has enough such material of its own.
1:44 p.m. U.S. President Joe Biden announced additional sanctions on the Kremlin . Biden said Russia has been planning this attack for months, moving 175,000 troops, military equipment, moved blood supplies and even built a field hospital.
The U.S. has imposed financial sanctions on four more Russian banks, including that country’s largest financial institution. “We will limit Russia's ability to do business in dollars, euros, pounds, and yen,” Biden said.
“The United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power,” said Biden, adding that additional armed forces are not going to engage in the conflict but rather to “defend NATO allies.”
The U.S. is also authorizing additional use of force to Germany.
When asked by a reporter whether he believed the “devastating” sanctions announced by the White House are as devastating as Russian bullets, missiles and tanks, Biden said yes. He said he believed financial pressures would force Putin to make a “difficult choice.”
1:09 p.m. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Canada is imposing more severe sanctions on Russia in response to its military strike against Ukraine.
The new sanctions will target 58 people and entities connected to Russia, including members of that country's elite and their families, the paramilitary organization known as the Wagner Group and major Russian banks.
The sanctions, announced today after Trudeau attended a virtual G7 meeting, will also affect members of the Russian Security Council, including key cabinet ministers.
Canada is also cancelling existing export permits for Russia and will not issue new ones.
Trudeau also says the federal government will be prioritizing immigration applications for Ukrainians who want to come to Canada and is launching a dedicated telephone line for anyone who has any urgent questions about immigrating from Ukraine.
He says Canada has arranged for the safe passage of any Canadian citizens, permanent residents and their families still in Ukraine through land borders with Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Moldova.
1 p.m. (updated) A presidential adviser says Ukraine lost control of the Chernobyl nuclear site, where Ukranian forces had waged a fierce battle with Russian troops.
Adviser Myhailo Podolyak told The Associated Press that Ukrainian authorities did not know the current condition of the facilities at Chernobyl, the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster.
“After the absolutely senseless attack of the Russians in this direction, it is impossible to say that the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is safe,” he said.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had announced several hours earlier Thursday that Russian forces were trying to seize the Chernobyl nuclear plant.
A nuclear reactor at the plant 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, exploded in April 1986, spewing radioactive waste across Europe.
The exploded reactor was covered by a protective shelter several years ago to prevent radiation leaks.
12:55 p.m. World leaders Thursday condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine as “barbaric" and moved to slap unprecedented economic sanctions on the Kremlin.
The West and its allies showed no inclination to send troops into Ukraine and risk a wider European war. But NATO reinforced its member states in Eastern Europe as a precaution against an attack on them, too.
“Make no mistake: We will defend every ally against any attack on every inch of NATO territory,” said NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg.
In the meantime, the allies began to take steps aimed at isolating Moscow and forcing it to pay so high a price that it changes course.
“Our mission is clear: Diplomatically, politically, economically and eventually militarily, this hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure,” said British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
As the first major world leader to make a big move, he announced a freeze on the assets of all large Russian banks and plans to bar Russian companies and the Kremlin from raising money on British markets.
Britain will also ban the export to Russia of a wide range of high-tech products, including semiconductors, and prohibit the nation’s flagship airline, Aeroflot, from landing at British airports.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Stoltenberg both called the invasion a “barbaric" attack on an independent nation that threatened “the stability in Europe and the whole of the international peace order.” The European Union scheduled an emergency summit in Brussels.
Von der Leyen threatened to hit Russia with "massive and targeted sanctions.” She said she would put to EU leaders late Thursday a proposal that would target strategic sectors of the Russian economy by blocking access to key technologies and markets.
12:46 p.m. The Russian Defense Ministry has confirmed that its ground forces have moved into Ukraine from Crimea, the first confirmation from Moscow that its ground forces have moved in.
Russia previously said only that it unleashed air and missile strikes on Ukrainian air bases, air defense batteries and other military facilities. The ministry said it has destroyed 83 Ukrainian military facilities.
For the first time since the start of the action, Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov confirmed the Russian ground troops had rolled into Ukraine, saying they advanced toward the city of Kherson, northwest of Crimea.
Kherson sits on reservoir providing the bulk of fresh water for Crimea until Ukraine cut it off with a dam in 2017 in response to Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula.
Konashenkov said that the Russian troops’ move allowed to resume water supply to Crimea.
12:41 p.m. Brazilian soccer players from Ukraine's two biggest clubs issued an appeal to the Brazilian government on Thursday, saying they are trapped by the Russian military attack on Ukraine.
A group of players from Shakhtar Donetsk and Dynamo Kyiv posted a video together with their families from a hotel where they called for support from the Brazilian authorities, joined by Uruguayan player Carlos de Pena of Dynamo. They said the borders were closed and fuel supplies had run out.
“We are really desperate. We are going through chaos,” Shakhtar defender Marlon Santos wrote on Instagram. "We have the support from our club. But the desperation is agonizing. We wait for the support from our country. We speak in the name of all the Brazilians in Ukraine.”
Similar messages were posted by Brazilian players living elsewhere in Ukraine, including by forward Marlyson and two teammates from Metalist 1925 in the northeastern city of Kharkiv, near the Russian border, and three players from Zorya Luhansk, a club based in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia.
The Ukrainian league was suspended indefinitely Thursday after martial law was declared in Ukraine.
Ukrainian clubs have long recruited Brazilian players to boost their performance on the field and to make a profit in the transfer market. Up-and-coming Brazilian players often see the Ukrainian league as a shop window to show off their skills to clubs in Europe's biggest leagues, especially if they play for Champions League regulars Shakhtar and Dynamo. Shakhtar lists 11 Brazilian players in its first-team squad and another, Junior Moraes, who is a naturalized Ukrainian citizen.
Shakhtar and Zorya were both founded in cities in eastern Ukraine but haven't been able to play there since Russia-backed separatists took over their home cities in 2014.
12:23 p.m. Videos are being shared widely on social media of anti-war protests currently taking place in Russia. Journalists like Telegraph reporter Natalia Vasilyeva are saying nearly 1,000 people are in attendance and that some protesters including journalists are being detained “indiscriminately.”
12:17 p.m. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to hit Russia hard for its aggression in Ukraine and ordered an asset freeze Thursday against all main Russian banks including VTB, Russia’s second-largest bank.
Johnson also said the nation would aim to cut off Russia from the U.K. financial sector by prohibiting all major Russian companies from raising finance on U.K. markets and the Russian state from raising sovereign debt in the U.K.
He also announced bans on a wide range of high-tech exports to Russia such as semiconductors
11:46 a.m.: Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly has summoned Russia's ambassador to Canada for a dressing down after his country's invasion of Ukraine.
The minister's office tells The Canadian Press that Ambassador Oleg V. Stepanov met Joly at the headquarters of Global Affairs Canada, where she condemned "in the strongest possible terms Russia's egregious attack on Ukraine."
Joly told Stepanov that Russia has violated Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence.
11:17 a.m.: In a statement on Thursday, the Ukrainian Canadian Congress CEO and Executive Director, Ihor Michalchyshyn, made requests to the Canadian government regarding the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Those requests include for Russian assets in the West to be seized, to shut off Russia from the SWIFT banking system, sanctions against Russia's central bank, and sanctions against oligarchs.
The UCC also says Ukraine needs more weapons such as, "Anti-air systems like stinger missiles and other air defence and naval defense systems." They additionally ask Canada and allies to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine to protect civilians from Russian bombardment.
"In the 1930s the world was slow to recognize the danger that Adolf Hitler posed to our civilization. We cannot make that same mistake again with Putin," the UCC says in a statement.
Star reporter Alex Ballingall reports.
10:49 a.m.: The Premier of Ontario called Vladimir Putin “a thug” in statements made in the legislature Thursday morning. Doug Ford said Ukraine and Canada are “forever tied together as two nations an ocean apart” and made references to Ukrainian-Canadian greats who became household names like Wayne Gretzky, Randy Bachman and Alex Trebek.
The premier listed significant dates like the start of the First and Second World War, and said he hoped Feb. 24, 2022 would not be one that required adding to the history books.
10:36 a.m. (Updated 10:59 a.m.): Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Russian forces are trying to seize the Chernobyl nuclear plant.
“National Guard troops responsible for protecting the storage unit for dangerous radioactive waste are putting up fierce resistance,” said Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to the interior minister. Should an artillery shell hit the storage unit, Herashchenko said, “radioactive dust could cover the territory of Ukraine, Belarus and the countries of the European Union.”
The plant was the site of the world’s worst nuclear accident when a nuclear reactor exploded in April 1986, spewing radioactive waste across Europe. The plant lies 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of the capital of Kyiv.
The exploded reactor has been covered by a protective shelter to prevent radiation leak and the entire plant has been decommissioned.
Zelenskyy said on Twitter that “our defenders are giving their lives so that the tragedy of 1986 will not be repeated.” He added that “this is a declaration of war against the whole of Europe.”
10:25 a.m.: Stock markets around the world plunged after Russia launched military action in Ukraine and prices for oil and gold jumped higher.
The S&P/TSX composite index was down 303.83 points at 20,440.34 in early trading, while European stock markets also fell.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 783.34 points at 32,348.42. The S&P 500 index was down 87.83 points at 4,137.67, while the Nasdaq composite was down 281.03 points at 12,756.46.
The Canadian dollar traded for 77.92 cents US compared with 78.63 cents US on Wednesday.
The April crude contract was up US$7.01 at US$99.11 per barrel and the April natural gas contract was up 27 cents at US$4.86 per mmBTU.
The April gold contract was up US$47.00 at US$1,957.40 an ounce and the May copper contract was down less than a penny at US$4.49 a pound.
10:17 a.m.: President Vladimir Putin has ordered Russian troops into Ukraine but made clear his target goes beyond his neighbor to America’s “empire of lies,” and he threatened “consequences you have never faced in your history” for “anyone who tries to interfere with us.”
In a rambling speech early Thursday, full of festering historical grievances and accusations of a relentless Western plot against his country, Putin reminded the world that Russia “remains one of the most powerful nuclear states” with “a certain advantage in several cutting edge weapons.”
In effect, Putin’s speech, intended to justify the invasion, seemed to come close to threatening nuclear war.
In the context of Russia’s nuclear arsenal, Putin said, “there should be no doubt that any potential aggressor will face defeat and ominous consequences should it directly attack our country.”
“We now have war in Europe on a scale and of a type we thought belonged to history,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday, describing the incursion as “a deliberate, cold-blooded and long-planned invasion” and a “blatant violation of international law.”
“This is a grave moment for the security of Europe,” said Stoltenberg, who will convene an emergency virtual summit of NATO leaders Friday. “Russia’s unjustified and unprovoked attack on Ukraine is putting countless innocent lives at risk with air and missile attacks, ground forces and special forces from multiple directions, targeting military infrastructure and major urban centers.”
9:29 a.m.: Dozens of Ukrainian military personnel were killed in the early hours of Russia’s multipronged assault on the country, officials said Thursday, as its overmatched army strained to mount an “all-out defense” against Russian forces advancing by land, sea and air.
More than 40 Ukrainian soldiers were killed and dozens were wounded in fighting Thursday morning, said Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine.
At least 18 military officials were killed in an attack outside the Black Sea port city of Odessa, where amphibious commandos from the Russian navy came ashore, according to Sergey Nazarov, an aide to Odessa’s mayor.
9:28 a.m.: Since Feb. 1, the Canadian government has been advising Canadians to leave Ukraine while flights and other forms of commercial travel were still available.
“You should not depend on the Government of Canada to help you leave the country. If you are in Ukraine, you should shelter in place unless it is safe for you to leave the country,” reads the federal site.
Canadians still in Ukraine are advised to have a security plan in place, identify the location of the closest bomb shelter, monitor credible news outlets for updates, and register their contact information through the Registration of Canadians Abroad service.
“In case of an attack, seek shelter in a hardened structure and away from windows,” reads the site.
Canadians trying to leave Ukraine now are being urged to use their best judgement and up to date information in order to determine the safest routes to leave. Borders may close without notice, and additional restrictions or requirements may be implemented suddenly by other countries.
“If you plan to leave Ukraine by air or land, confirm your destination’s entry requirements prior to arrival,” warns the site.
9:27 a.m.: President Joe Biden is expected on Thursday to announce the U.S. will impose severe economic sanctions on Russia over what he described as an “unprovoked and unjustified attack” on Ukraine.
In a statement issued just after midnight, Biden did not detail what those “severe” measures would entail but said he was hoping to “rally international condemnation” of the attack. The White House in recent days has ordered sanctions that officials said would target Russian financial institutions and the country’s elites and their family members, including the head of Russia’s Federal Security Service.
“President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering,” Biden said in a statement Wednesday night. “Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.”
8:43 a.m.: French President Emmanuel Macron says France and its European allies did everything to try to head off the attack on Ukraine. He said that they will show “no weakness” in their response.
Macron said in a televised address to the nation Thursday that Russia’s attack is a “turning point in European history” and as a result “there will be profound consequences for our continent and changes in our lives.”
He said that “to this act of war, we will reply without weakness, we will reply calmly and in a determined and united manner.”
“We have tried everything to avoid this war but it is here and we are ready,” Macron said.
He said that sanctions will be “proportionate” to Russia’s military operations, targeting its economy and its energy sector.
“We will show no weakness,” Macron said. “We will take all measures necessary to defend the sovereignty and stability of our European allies.”
8:22 a.m.: The Auschwitz Memorial has weighed in on the Ukraine-Russia conflict, issuing a statement Thursday morning.
“This act of barbarity will be judged by history, and its perpetrators, it is to be hoped, also by the International Court of Justice,” reads the statement posted on Twitter this morning.
The organization goes on to condemn Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, saying that once again innocent people are being killed “purely because of insane pseudo-imperial megalomania.”
The Memorial preserves the site of the former German Nazi Auschwitz concentration and extermination camp.
8:09 a.m.: Even with the tons of weapons, ammunition and equipment delivered to Ukraine by Western allies in just the last few weeks, the Ukrainian military is outgunned by the larger, more technologically advanced Russian forces that have launched a multipronged invasion.
Back in December, the commander of Ukraine’s military intelligence service, Gen. Kyrylo O. Budanov, outlined a scenario in which a Russian invasion would begin with airstrikes and rocket attacks aimed at ammunition depots and trench-bound troops — foreshadowing the attack that came early Thursday morning.
Very quickly, he said, the Ukrainian military would be incapacitated, its leadership unable to coordinate a defense and supply the front. After that, he said, responsibility would fall to frontline commanders to carry on the fight alone.
“They will hold up as long as there are bullets,” Budanov said. “They’ll be able to use what they have in their hands. But believe me, without delivery of reserves, there’s not an army in the world that can hold out.”
Budanov spoke at a time when the Russian military had deployed about 100,000 troops to the region. By the time of the invasion, according to U.S. officials, Russia had amassed an estimated 190,000 troops in or near Ukraine, including in Crimea and in Russia-backed separatist areas in the eastern Donbas region.
7:57 a.m.: The National Bank of Ukraine has opened an account for Ukraine’s armed forces. Their statement on Thursday reads:
“The National Bank of Ukraine has decided to open a special fundraising account to support the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
The central bank’s decision comes after the Ukrainian government imposed martial law throughout Ukraine in response to armed aggression by Russia and the renewed threat to Ukraine’s independence and territorial integrity.
NBU Governor Kyrylo Shevchenko announced the opening of this special account in his 24 February video address .
The number of the special account: UA843000010000000047330992708
This account accepts multiple currencies. It has been established and opened to receive transfers from international partners and donors in both foreign currency (U.S. dollars, euros, UK pounds) and hryvnias.
Support the Armed Forces of Ukraine!”
7:36 a.m.: Ukrainian forces were in “all-out defense mode” on Thursday to repel a multipronged Russian assault by land, sea and air. The Ukrainian military claimed to have shot down several Russian military aircraft, and civilians lined up at recruitment offices to take up arms against President Vladimir Putin’s forces.
More than 40 Ukrainian soldiers were killed and dozens were wounded in fighting Thursday morning, said Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine.
The country’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said that Ukraine was facing “a full-scale attack from multiple directions” but that it “continues to defend itself” from the Russian advance.
Initial reports of the fighting suggested that Russian forces had crossed into Ukraine at multiple points, with helicopter-borne troops flying in under the cover of machine-gun fire, naval units coming ashore in the southern port city of Odessa and military vehicles crossing from Crimea, the peninsula that Russia seized in 2014.
Ukrainian forces said they had shot down several Russian fighters and a helicopter in an increasingly intense battle to maintain control over key cities, a senior Ukrainian military official said. Ukrainian troops had also repelled Russian advances on two major cities: Chernihiv in the north, near the Belarus border, and Kharkiv in the northeast, close to Russia, the official said.
6:42 a.m.: Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda on Thursday signed a decree declaring a state of emergency in the Baltic country in response to Russia’s military attack on Ukraine.
The Baltic country’s parliament was expected to approve the measure in an extraordinary session later on Thursday.
The measure, in effect until March 10, allows for a more flexible use of state reserve funds and increased border protection, giving border guards greater authorities to stop and search individuals and vehicles in border areas.
NATO member Lithuania borders Russia’s Kaliningrad region to the southwest, Belarus to the east, Latvia to the north and Poland to the south.
6:41 a.m. (Updated 7:38 a.m.):
Speaking after chairing an emergency meeting of NATO envoys, Stoltenberg said the 30-nation security alliance will continue to beef up its defenses on its eastern flank near Ukraine and Russia. He said U.S. President Joe Biden and his NATO counterparts will hold an online summit on Friday.
“Russia has attacked Ukraine. This is a brutal act of war. Our thoughts are with the brave people of Ukraine," Stoltenberg told reporters. “Peace in our continent has been shattered. We now have war in Europe, on a scale and of a type we thought belong to history."
“NATO is the strongest alliance in history, and make no mistake we will defend every ally against any attack on every inch of NATO territory,” he said at the organization's Brussels headquarters. “An attack on one ally will trigger a response from the whole alliance."
Earlier:
NATO’s secretary-general says Russia has launched war on Ukraine and shattered peace on the European continent.
Jens Stoltenberg called for a summit of NATO alliance leaders for Friday.
Russia launched a wide-ranging attack on Ukraine on Thursday, hitting cities and bases with airstrikes or shelling. Ukraine’s government said Russian tanks and troops rolled across the border and accused Moscow of unleashing a “full-scale war.”
6:40 a.m.: NATO agreed at emergency talks on Thursday to further beef up its land, sea and air forces on its eastern flank near Ukraine and Russia after President Vladimir Putin ordered a military offensive in Ukraine.
“We are deploying additional defensive land and air forces to the eastern part of the alliance, as well as additional maritime assets,” NATO ambassadors said in a statement. “We have increased the readiness of our forces to respond to all contingencies.”
Countries closest to the conflict — Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland — requested rare consultations under Article 4 of NATO’s founding treaty, which can be launched when “the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the (NATO) parties is threatened.”
“We have decided, in line with our defensive planning to protect all allies, to take additional steps to further strengthen deterrence and defence across the Alliance,” the envoys said. “Our measures are and remain preventive, proportionate and nonescalatory.”
While some of NATO’s 30 member countries are supplying arms, ammunition and other equipment to Ukraine, NATO as an organization isn’t. It won’t launch any military action in support of Ukraine, which is a close partner but has no prospect of joining.
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, however, said in a joint-statement: “We would need to urgently provide Ukrainian people with weapons, ammunition and any other kind of military support to defend itself as well as economic, financial and political assistance and support, humanitarian aid.”
“The most effective response to Russia’s aggression is unity,” Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas tweeted. “Russia’s widespread aggression is a threat to the entire world and to all NATO countries.”
6:40 a.m. (Updated 6:50 a.m.):
UEFA will no longer stage this season's Champions League final in St. Petersburg after Russia attacked Ukraine, The Associated Press has learned.
An extraordinary meeting of the UEFA executive committee will be held on Friday to discuss the geopolitical crisis and when officials are set to confirm taking the May 28 showpiece game out of Russia, a person with knowledge of the process said on Thursday. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private talks.
UEFA confirmed there is a meeting due at 0900 GMT on Friday.
“Following the evolution of the situation between Russia and Ukraine in the last 24 hours, the UEFA president has decided to call an extraordinary meeting of the executive committee .... in order to evaluate the situation and take all necessary decisions,” UEFA said in a statement.
Earlier:
UEFA has called an emergency meeting of its top decision-making body to discuss moving the Champions League final out of Russia after Moscow attacked Ukraine on Thursday.
The British government has been leading calls for the showpiece game to no longer be played in St. Petersburg on May 28.
The extraordinary meeting of the UEFA executive committee will be held on Friday “in order to evaluate the situation and take all necessary decisions,” European football’s governing body said in a statement.
The Ukrainian Premier League suspended operations on Thursday due to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s decision to impose martial law. The league has been on a two-month winter break and was due to resume on Friday. It did not give any planned date to restart.
The International Paralympic Committee said it was in talks with sports officials in Ukraine and Russia as their teams prepare to head to China for the start of the Paralympic Games next week.
6:39 a.m.: China repeated calls for talks to resolve the crisis in Ukraine on Thursday while refusing to criticize Russia’s attack and accusing the U.S. and its allies of worsening the situation.
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told reporters at a daily briefing that “the Ukraine issue is complex in its historical background ... what we are seeing today is the interplay of complex factors.”
“China is closely following the latest developments,” Hua said. “We still hope that the parties concerned will not shut the door to peace and engage instead in dialogue and consultation and prevent the situation from further escalating,”
Although China has not endorsed President Vladimir Putin’s recognition of independence of eastern Ukraine’s separatist areas or Putin’s decision to send Russian forces there, Hua said China “called on parties to respect others’ legitimate security concerns.”
“All parties should work for peace instead of escalating the tension or hyping up the possibility of war,” Hua said, repeating the language China has consistently used to criticize the West during the crisis.
“Those parties who were busy condemning others, what have they done ? Have they persuaded others?” Hua said.
6:38 a.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is urging global leaders to provide defence assistance to Ukraine and help protect its airspace from Russia.
In a statement that comes amid Russia’s wide-ranging attack on Ukraine that began early Thursday, Zelenskyy said that Russia “has unleased a war with Ukraine and the entire democratic world.”
He asked for world leaders to provide large-scale defence support and to protect Ukraine’s airspace from the “aggressor.”
6:37 a.m.: The European Union is planning the “strongest, the harshest package” of sanctions it has ever considered at an emergency Thursday, as the Russian military attacked Ukraine.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that “the target is the stability in Europe and the whole of the international peace order, and we will hold President (Vladimir) Putin accountable for that.”
“We will present a package of massive and targeted sanctions to European leaders for approval,” she said.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called it the “strongest, the harshest package” ever considered.
6:36 a.m.: The turmoil from the beginning of a long-feared act of aggression rippled from Europe to Asia. Stock markets plunged, oil prices surged, and European aviation officials warned of a high risk to civilian aircraft over Ukraine, reminding air operators that “this is now an active conflict zone.”
In New York, the U.N. Security Council held an extraordinary emergency meeting meant to dissuade Russia from sending troops into Ukraine. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ plea to “give peace a chance” came just as Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared on Russian TV to announce a military operation that he maintained was to protect civilians in Ukraine.
Putin, who said that rebels in eastern Ukraine had asked Moscow for military assistance, warned other countries that any effort to interfere with the Russian operation would lead to “consequences they have never seen.”
As leaders across Asia and Europe scrambled to condemn the attack, explosions were heard in Kyiv and other cities in Ukraine. Nations around the world this week have also imposed a raft of new sanctions on Russia.
“In these dark hours, our thoughts are with Ukraine and the innocent women, men and children as they face this unprovoked attack and fear for their lives,” European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Twitter. “We will hold the Kremlin accountable.”
6:35 a.m.: With rare but fragile alignment, the U.S. Congress is largely backing President Joe Biden’s decision to confront Russia with potentially escalating sanctions for the crisis in Ukraine as lawmakers brace for perhaps the most daunting foreign policy crisis the nation has faced in a generation.
But the next steps are highly volatile — even more so after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced early Thursday a military operation in Ukraine and explosions were heard in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odessa and other cities there.
“We must refuse to stand by and watch innocent Ukrainian men, women, and children suffer,” the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., said in a statement after Putin’s forces moved against Ukraine. He said he was “committed to ensuring that the United States upholds our responsibility to exact maximum costs on Putin, the Russian economy, and those who enabled and facilitated this trampling of Ukraine’s sovereignty.”
6:34 a.m.: The emergency U.N. Security Council meeting was meant as an eleventh hour effort to dissuade Russia from sending troops into Ukraine. But the message became moot even as it was being delivered.
While diplomats at U.N. headquarters were making pleas for Russia to back off — “Give peace a chance,” Secretary-General Antonio Guterres implored — Russian President Vladimir Putin went on television in his homeland to announce a military operation that he said was intended to protect civilians in Ukraine.
Putin warned other countries that any effort to interfere with the Russian operation would lead to “consequences they have never seen.”
6:33 a.m.: Russian troops launched their anticipated attack on Ukraine on Thursday, as President Vladimir Putin cast aside international condemnation and sanctions, warning other countries that any attempt to interfere would lead to “consequences you have never seen.”
Big explosions were heard before dawn in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa as world leaders decried the start of an Russian invasion that could cause massive casualties and topple Ukraine’s democratically elected government.
Thursday 6:32 a.m.: President Joe Biden said the world would “hold Russia accountable” as explosions were seen in Ukraine’s second-largest city minutes after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the start of a “special military operation” in the country.
“President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering,” Biden said in a statement Wednesday night. “Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. ”

CAPTION: Georgians rally in support of Ukraine after Russia began it's invasion on Feb. 24, 2022 in Tbilisi, Georgia. Overnight, Russia began a large-scale attack on Ukraine, with explosions reported in multiple cities and far outside the restive eastern regions held by Russian-backed rebels.

Full text: The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Thursday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available .
6:16 p.m. The Biden administration will significantly loosen federal mask-wearing guidelines to protect against COVID-19 transmission on Friday, according to two people familiar with the matter, meaning most Americans will no longer be advised to wear masks in indoor public settings, The Associated Press reports.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday will announce a change to the metrics it uses to determine whether to recommend face coverings, shifting from looking at COVID-19 case-counts to a more holistic view of risk from the coronavirus to a community.
Under current guidelines, masks are recommended for people residing in communities of substantial or high transmission — roughly 95 per cent of U.S. counties, according to the latest data, according to AP.
The new metrics will still consider caseloads, but also take into account hospitalizations and local hospital capacity, which have been markedly improved during the emergence of the Omicron variant.
That strain is highly transmissible, but indications are that it is less severe than earlier strains, particularly for people who are fully vaccinated and boosted.
Under the new guidelines, based on current data, the vast majority of Americans will no longer live in areas where indoor masking in public is recommended.
The new policy comes as the Biden administration moves to shift its focus to preventing serious illness and death from COVID-19, not all instances of infection, as part of a strategy adjustment for a new “phase” in the response as the virus becomes endemic.
The two people familiar with the change spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the CDC’s action before the announcement.
4:51 p.m. Mask mandates are staying in place in Ontario for now, but when they are removed for public settings they will simultaneously be lifted in schools, the province’s top doctor said Thursday, reports The Canadian Press.
Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Kieran Moore, said high-risk settings such as public transit, long-term care and hospitals will maintain masking policies even after they are no longer required in most public spaces. But consultations have started for schools, according to CP.
“We will be working with school boards, with parents, with the ministries, and make a decision together, but we do anticipate if we remove it in the public sector, we would do it simultaneously for the schools,” Moore said.
“That would seem to align, as the risk decreases to do them together.”
Moore also said he is reviewing isolation requirements, such as those for people with COVID-19 symptoms and their household members.
The chief medical officer of health had previously said he wanted to end workplace COVID-19 vaccination policies in sectors such as hospitals and post-secondary institutions on March 1, when capacity limits will lift in indoor public settings and Ontario’s vaccine certificate system is dropped.
But he said Thursday that he is working with the various sectors, and removing those policies may take longer.
For healthcare workers, though the provincial directives may soon be lifted, Moore said he still strongly recommends that anyone providing care to vulnerable people be immunized and that health-care facilities should still have policies for new hires.
“Directives from the CMOH office are meant to be time-limited and they are to (address) an immediate risk to the health of the population,” Moore said.
“So we are forced to review any directive that’s in place, given that we’re at a different phase of the pandemic, and the risk is decreasing day by day.”
Health Canada on Thursday approved a new homegrown vaccine made with plant-based technology, from Medicago, but Moore said Ontario doesn’t expect to receive doses until May or June. Novavax, another non-mRNA vaccine, which was approved last week, should be available in Ontario in mid-March, Moore said.
Public health indicators are improving, though the risk from the virus remains, he said.
“The virus is still present,” Moore said. “It’s just that the impact on the healthcare system has stabilized.”
Ontario reported 1,066 people in hospital Thursday with COVID-19 and 302 in intensive care. That’s slightly down from Wednesday, when the province reported 1,106 hospitalizations and 319 people in ICUs.
Ontario also logged 41 new deaths from the virus.
There were 2,404 new cases of COVID-19, but provincial policies limiting access to testing mean that number is likely higher.
4:01 p.m Health Canada is warning Canadians of the potential risks associated with accidentally ingesting or spilling COVID-19 rapid antigen test kit solutions on the skin after hearing about dozens of calls to poison control centres, reports The Canadian Press.
The agency issued a public advisory on the federal government’s website on Thursday, saying it is aware of approximately 50 calls related to accidental exposure, which have resulted in minor health problems, according to CP.
Health Canada said it was advising Canadians on “a precautionary basis” of the risks associated with misuse, accidental ingestion or skin exposure.
The agency said the tests are safe and effective when used properly, but many kits include liquid solutions with chemical preservatives, including sodium azide and Proclin, that may be poisonous if swallowed or absorbed through the skin.
Health Canada said small children and pets are especially vulnerable to adverse effects, even from small doses.
Health Canada advised that test kits and solutions be kept out of reach of children and pets, adding people should follow instructions for proper disposal and contact poison control centres in cases of ingestion or direct skin exposure.
Health Canada said the solution should not be swallowed and eye and skin contact should be avoided. If solution is spilled, the agency said to rinse well with water.
People can report health product-related side effects or complaints to Health Canada.
3:53 p.m. New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs today unveiled the province’s timeline to end all pandemic-related public health restrictions, reports The Canadian Press.
He says proof of vaccination will no longer be required as of Feb. 28, and all remaining measures will be lifted on March 14, according to CP.
Higgs told reporters those include mask mandates, capacity limits and isolation requirements for people who test positive for COVID-19.
Nova Scotia announced Wednesday it would lift all restrictions on March 21, while Newfoundland and Labrador is also aiming for March 14.
Officials in New Brunswick say there are 77 people hospitalized due to COVID-19, five of whom are in intensive care and two of whom are on ventilators.
The province reported 365 new cases confirmed with a PCR test and 819 new cases confirmed with rapid tests, which residents report themselves.
3:51 p.m. Ontario’s top doctor says mask mandates are staying in place for now, but when they are removed for public settings they will simultaneously be lifted in schools, reports The Canadian Press.
Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Kieran Moore, says high-risk settings such as public transit, long-term care and hospitals will maintain masking policies even after they are no longer required in most public spaces, according to CP.
Moore had previously said he wanted to end workplace COVID-19 vaccination policies in sectors such as hospitals and post-secondary institutions on March 1, when capacity limits will lift in indoor public settings and Ontario’s vaccine certificate system is dropped.
But he says today that he is working with the various sectors, and removing those policies may take longer.

2:46 p.m. Nova Scotia’s premier says the government is in talks to get public-sector workers who refused to be vaccinated under the government’s COVID-19 mandates back on the job, reports The Canadian Press.
But Tim Houston cautions there are higher risk areas on the front lines of health and long-term -care that will likely still require COVID-19 vaccinations when the mandates are eventually lifted, according to CP.
Although no final decisions have been made, Houston says it’s his belief that COVID-19 vaccines will be added to the list of vaccinations needed to work in the health field.
Colton LeBlanc, the minister responsible for the public service commission, says a total of 82 public servants from across provincial government departments are currently on administrative leave without pay because they are not vaccinated.
In early December, the province reported that more than 1,000 government and other public sector workers had been placed on unpaid leave, including 963 workers in front-line healthcare, continuing care, education and corrections.
Houston announced on Wednesday the province will lift all remaining COVID-19 restrictions on March 21.
2:24 p.m. Ontario’s long-term care minister says a mandate requiring workers in the sector to get vaccinated against COVID-19 is under review.
Paul Calandra says the rule is being looked at as the government reviews all of its sector-specific vaccination policies and other pandemic measures.
Dr. Kieran Moore, the province’s top doctor, has said that he wants to end workplace COVID-19 vaccination policies by March 1, when proof-of-vaccination rules in indoor spaces are also set to end.
Calandra didn’t say whether he was aiming for that date to end the mandate.

2:15 p.m. Ontario’s long-term care minister says a mandate requiring workers in the sector to get vaccinated against COVID-19 is under review, reports The Canadian Press.
Paul Calandra says the rule is being looked at as the government reviews all of its sector-specific vaccination policies and other pandemic measures, according to CP.
Dr. Kieran Moore, the province’s top doctor, has said that he wants to end workplace COVID-19 vaccination policies by March 1, when proof-of-vaccination rules in indoor spaces are also set to end.
Calandra didn’t say whether he was aiming for that date to end the mandate.
Workers in long-term care homes are currently required to have two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine to stay on the job and they have until March 14 to get third shots.
It’s the only sector in which Ontario has made COVID-19 vaccination a requirement for employment.
1:33 p.m. Newfoundlanders and Labradorians will be able to hit the dance floors once again beginning Monday, though they’ll still have to wear a mask.
The province’s chief medical officer of health says despite a slight increase in COVID-19 activity, hospitalizations have remained stable and it’s safe to move ahead with the easing of some restrictions Monday.
Dr. Janice Fitzgerald says beginning Monday, formal gatherings can operate at 75 per cent capacity, as can bars, lounges, bingo halls and performance spaces.
1:20 p.m. Yukon’s premier says the territory is set to move ahead with plans to ease many COVID-19 restrictions starting next week.
Sandy Silver says capacity limits on gatherings will be lifted, and bars and restaurants can return to normal service with dancing and mingling between tables on March 4.
He told a news conference Thursday that masks will still be required in indoor public places and proof of vaccination must still be shown to access certain settings.
1:15 p.m. The Manitoba government is ending its requirement for health-care staff, teachers and other front-line workers to either be vaccinated against COVID-19 or undergo frequent testing.
Chief public health officer Dr. Brent Roussin says the requirement, which took effect in October, is being lifted as of March 1.
He says all signs show the Omicron wave of the pandemic is fading, with fewer people in hospital and in intensive care.
The province had earlier announced that March 1 will mark the end of another rule — one that requires people to show proof of vaccination to enter many public venues.
1:03 p.m. The Saskatchewan Party government, which has repeatedly said people need to “learn to live with COVID-19,” is renewing its state of emergency.
Premier Scott Moe signed an order-in-council on Wednesday to extend the emergency order “to address the COVID-19 public health emergency.”
The order will renew on Monday, the same day Saskatchewan is to lift all remaining pandemic restrictions, including an indoor mask mandate and the requirement to self-isolate after testing positive for COVID-19.
Saskatchewan’s state of emergency order was re-enacted in September during the Delta wave, and gives the government power to redirect health-care workers. It also gives the government broad authority to control travel within the province, to take control of the emergency response of a local authority and to require people to comply with any health orders.
12:38 p.m. The Toronto International Film Festival says it is planning to bring back more in-person events this fall, including public screenings, an opening night party, networking opportunities and an awards gala.
TIFF organizers say the 47thedition will feature 11 days of screenings and events from Sept. 8 to 18.
They say that includes networking and celebratory gatherings that were curtailed or scrapped during the past two pandemic-constrained festivals.
Organizers touted the return of in-person film screenings, the opening night party, the industry conference, filmmaker dinners, industry networking events, press and programmers events and the TIFF Tribute Awards gala.

12:18 p.m. An Ottawa-inspired “freedom convoy” is making its way to the U.S. capital, but as of now, it has little else in common with its Canadian namesake.
Where the protests in Canada’s capital were organized, unified and bent on disruption, the D.C. endeavour appears amorphous and is still taking shape.
One contingent departed Wednesday from a staging area in California, with others expected to join up in time for President Joe Biden’s state of the union speech next Tuesday.
The Pentagon has agreed to deploy 700 unarmed members of the National Guard to help with traffic, but beyond that, authorities aren’t sure what to expect.

12:15 p.m. A subvariant of the Omicron COVID-19 strain that has been circulating across the world appears to be picking up steam in some countries just as their latest waves of viral activity subside.
BA.2 was detected in Canada as early as December, according to Health Canada data, but a report last week from the B.C. COVID-19 modelling group suggests the newer Omicron strain could be spreading faster in parts of the country than the current dominant version, BA.1.
Data is limited across Canada, however, said co-author of the report Sarah Otto. Places like Alberta, where BA.2 accounted for 35 per cent of new infections last week, could be seeing inflated numbers from samples that were pre-screened for the subvariant before they were further analyzed, she added.
Experts say it’s unclear whether a rise in BA.2 will threaten reopening plans as provinces lift restrictions and nix vaccine passports. But the timing could complicate things if the subvariant were to cause more severe disease than other Omicron strains, or if protection from vaccines and infections began to wane significantly.
Here’s what we know about the latest COVID-19 subvariant.
11:59 a.m. The secure perimeter around downtown Ottawa, guarded by police checkpoints, will remain through the weekend as the local police force tries to maintain peace and order in Canada’s capital city without the extra powers they were granted through the Emergencies Act.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Wednesday the extraordinary, time-limited powers brought in last week to respond to protests and blockades against COVID-19 restrictions and the Liberal government would be pulled back now that the immediate crisis is over.
Interim Ottawa police Chief Steve Bell said Thursday that stoked some initial concern among the upper ranks of the police force about how they would keep demonstrators out of the city.

11:50 a.m. Quebec is reporting 28 more COVID-19 related deaths as intensive care cases dropped below 100 patients in the latest data today.
The Health Department says 1,604 people are hospitalized with the disease, a decline of 68 from the previous day.
There are 96 people listed in intensive care, a drop of six patients.
10:17 a.m. (updated): Ontario is reporting 302 people in ICU due to COVID-19 and 1,066 in hospital overall testing positive for COVID-19, according to its latest report released Saturday morning.
Of the people hospitalized, 49 per cent were admitted for COVID-19 and 51 per cent were admitted for other reasons but have since tested positive. For the ICU numbers, 74 per cent were admitted for COVID-19 and 26 per cent were admitted for other reasons but have since tested positive.
The numbers represent a 5 per cent decrease in the ICU COVID-19 count and a 4 per cent decrease in hospitalizations overall. 26 per cent of the province’s 2,343 adult ICU beds remain available for new patients.

10:05 a.m. (updated) Health Canada has approved a COVID-19 vaccine made in Quebec for use in adults 18-64. Developed by Medicago , the vaccine is called Covifenz.
The two-dose, plant-based vaccine is authorized for use in people aged 18 to 64.
Health Canada says its effectiveness and safety in those under 18 and over 64 have “not yet been established.”
Clinical trials suggested the vaccine was 71 per cent effective in protecting against COVID-19 one week after the second dose. The dosing schedule is 21 days apart.
Medicago, a biotechnology company based in Quebec City, along with GlaxoSmithKline, submitted Phase 3 data to Health Canada in December.
Dr. Supriya Sharma, chief medical adviser at Health Canada, said the vaccine’s active ingredients consist of particles that “mimic the spike protein of the virus that causes COVID-19.”
That allows the body to recognize them and spark an immune response.

9:10 a.m. Queen Elizabeth II postponed her daily virtual engagements Thursday, Buckingham Palace said, the second time she has taken such a step since she tested positive for the coronavirus on Sunday .
The palace did not specify why the meetings were called off, so it was unclear whether her absence reflected lingering COVID-19 symptoms. On Tuesday, the palace said she had cancelled virtual events because she was “still experiencing mild coldlike symptoms.”
The palace said the 95-year-old queen would be “continuing with light duties,” and that she had no other engagements scheduled this week. It did not say when Thursday’s virtual engagements would be rescheduled.

9 a.m. Ontario is telling emergency services to consider having paramedic crews tend to more than one patient at a time in hospital ERs as one way to reduce delays.
Ambulance offload delays, when paramedics wait in an emergency department for a patient to be transferred to the care of a hospital, have been exacerbated by the pandemic and have at times meant some regions are left with no available ambulances.
A recent memo sent by the government’s assistant deputy minister of emergency health services to paramedic chiefs offers guidelines for ways to “alleviate pandemic-related stressors” contributing to offload delays.

7 a.m.: Last year, for the first time in history, economic growth in Quebec outpaced every other province — and in the middle of a pandemic, too, writes star columnist David Olive. With GDP growth of more than six per cent in 2021, Quebec is expected to have posted a pandemic economic recovery more powerful than that of the U.S. and the European Union (EU), as well as its Canadian peers.
Those numbers become official in coming weeks. But Quebec’s strong performance in the first three quarters of 2021 alone ensures it the crown.
“The strength of Quebec’s economic rebound from COVID-19 has been nothing short of remarkable,” said Marc Desomeaux, senior economist at Scotiabank Economics.
The question now is whether Quebec’s status as an economic outperformer is sustainable... or will Quebec slip back into its tradition of lagging other provinces in GDP growth?

6:55 a.m.: Queen Elizabeth II postponed two virtual audiences as she continued to experience cold-like symptoms from COVID-19, Buckingham Palace said Thursday.
It was the second time this week that Elizabeth, 95, had canceled virtual sessions. However, she spoke by telephone with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday in what was seen as an encouraging sign of her recovery.
The monarch’s age, COVID-19 diagnosis and a health scare last year have caused worry among officials and the public. Her positive test for the coronavirus over the weekend prompted concern and get-well wishes from across Britain’s political spectrum.
The palace said Sunday that Elizabeth, who has been fully vaccinated and had a booster shot, would continue with “light” duties at Windsor Castle.
The queen, who is the country’s longest-reigning monarch. has a series of engagements coming up as she celebrates her Platinum Jubilee, marking 70 years on the throne. She is scheduled to host a March 2 reception which would involve meeting hundreds of diplomats at Windsor.
6 a.m.: As a patient takes their last breath in a silent hospital room, Dr. Warren Lewin thinks to himself, “I really hope we did our best.”
Palliative care doctors like Lewin have spent the pandemic desperately trying to manage patients’ symptoms, control their pain and ensure their end-of-life wishes are met from a medical standpoint.
But even as the worst of COVID-19’s highly infectious Omicron wave appears to be over, critically ill COVID patients continue to fill hospital beds. And two years after the pandemic first emerged in Canada, palliative care doctors are exhausted but holding steadfast.
The Star spoke to three palliative care doctors about their experiences caring for the sickest of patients as the pandemic enters its third year. With restrictions lifting in Ontario, the proof-of-vaccination system set to be eliminated on March 1, and the province mulling an end to indoor mask mandates, Premier Doug Ford said “everyone’s done with this” and ready for things to get back to normal. But because hospitalization and death rates lag behind daily COVID case counts, hospitals are still facing the pandemic head-on.
Those who work in palliative care fear the changes could leave the vulnerable behind.

5:40 a.m.: A new student-founded campaign is calling on Manitoba officials to retain some public health restrictions until COVID-19 becomes endemic.
As far as Grade 12 student Drayton Kejick-Fair is concerned, “Now is not the time for forced normalcy.”
“I’m no big activist or advocate, but when the government does something that potentially puts the people around you and the people that you love in danger, you have to do something about it,” Drayton said.
The 17-year-old is organizing a protest at the Manitoba Legislative Building at noon on Saturday to make known his concerns about the imminent loosening of restrictions.
5:21 a.m.: Hong Kong fell to second last among the 53 places scored in Bloomberg’s COVID Resilience Ranking in February, marking a rapid decline over the past few months.
The financial hub has dropped to the lowest position ever occupied by a developed economy in the 16 editions of the measure, which tracks the best and worst places to be in the pandemic. After flying as high as ninth a year ago, in January 2021, Hong Kong’s worst ever outbreak is crippling its pursuit of COVID Zero and paralyzing the once-vibrant economy.
5 a.m.: The heightened infectiousness of a subvariant of the coronavirus — that’s BA.2, nicknamed “stealth Omicron” — means it could be on its way to overtaking BA.1 as the most dominant form of Omicron in Ontario. But early evidence suggests it causes no more serious outcomes than the original version, leaving experts expressing cautious optimism.
But they warn that with the lifting of COVID-19 public health restrictions next week, there are many unknowns about what is in store for Ontario in the coming months.
“Currently everything looks great. Cases are dropping, hospitalizations are dropping, ICUs are being decompressed, deaths are going down, and by and large in most provinces the wastewater signals are in decline,” said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases specialist at University Health Network. “On the other hand, it’s still winter. There are still a lot of people congregating in indoor settings where there will be opportunities for the virus to transmit. Plus, we’ve got the lifting of many public health measures. Plus, we’ve got BA.2 .”
He added that these factors could mean a slowing in the decline of cases, a plateau or even a bump in numbers.
“I think we should just acknowledge there is uncertainty in the road that lies ahead.”

Thursday 5:36 a.m.: Vaccines and boosters proved highly effective against serious illness from the Omicron variant of COVID-19. What is also clear is that the defence afforded by vaccines — while still robust — tends to wane over time, leaving even some vaccinated and boosted individuals more vulnerable than others.
Data released earlier this month by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention examined people who got a booster shot of a Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine after completing a two-dose primary vaccination series.
During a time when omicron was the dominant coronavirus variant, vaccine effectiveness against COVID-related emergency department or urgent care visits for people was 87% during the two months after the booster shot, but that fell to 81% during the third month and dropped to 66% for the fourth month after the booster.
“I think that’s kind of a word of caution,” said Dr. George Rutherford, a epidemiologist and infectious diseases expert at UC San Francisco.
A subsequent booster would seemingly help address the issue of waning immunity. But not everyone is convinced a second booster will be needed anytime soon.

'What emergency exists today?' Senators ask for more details on government's need for special powers

Full text: Ahead of a crucial vote in the Senate on whether to confirm the government’s decision to invoke the Emergencies Act , senators lamented that they’ve been kept in the dark about the ongoing need for the unprecedented measure.
Debate on the declaration of emergency kicked off in the upper chamber Tuesday with senators expressing concern about when a parliamentary committee will be struck to provide oversight of the declaration, and the limitations on information that would be provided.
“There’s no blockades today. What emergency exists today that convinces the government hour by hour that this has to continue?” said Sen. Scott Tannas in a question to government representative Sen. Marc Gold.
“What emergency exists today, other than some secret emergency that you can’t tell anybody about and our oversight committee won’t get to know about either?”
The federal government invoked the Emergencies Act for the first time in history last Monday to deal with the weeks-long occupation in Ottawa by so-called Freedom Convoy protesters and blockades at border crossings. The protesters, who objected to COVID-19 vaccination requirements and pandemic-related public health restrictions, have now been cleared and ports of entry are open for trade and travel.
However, the government still needs the Senate to sign off on its declaration of an emergency. If the motion to approve it fails, the declaration will be revoked immediately. A vote is expected later this week.
A motion confirming the declaration passed in the House of Commons Monday evening in a 185-151 vote with the New Democrats voting in support of the Liberal minority government.
It’s not so clear how the Senate will vote, given that most members of the upper chamber are not affiliated with a political party and the Senate groups allow free votes.
Gold found himself on his feet repeatedly Tuesday, responding to senators who argued they lacked access to information on the ongoing security situation.
“Are we not creating a dangerous precedent for the future?” asked Sen. Julie Miville-Dechêne. “Could this exceptional law be invoked again solely on the basis of secret information, which obviously would be difficult to accept in a democracy?”
Sen. Elizabeth Marshall said it seemed like the federal government went from doing nothing at the beginning of the convoy protests to taking the “big step” of invoking the act.
“We’ve received general explanations as to the thought process that went into invoking the act,” she said, pressing Gold for specifics. “This is a serious step we’re contemplating here today. What exactly happened that the government decided to invoke the act?”
Gold reiterated throughout the day that there is plenty of information on the public record as to why the government invoked the act and feels that the declaration must remain in place for now. This includes protesters remaining in the vicinity of Ottawa, the possibility of new border blockades, and ongoing police investigations.
“The government is not relying upon a ‘Trust me, I know things you don’t know’ approach,” Gold said.
But his colleagues demanded to know why there would be limitations on the sensitive information that could be shared with a joint House-Senate committee that must be created to review the exercise of powers under the declaration. The committee would be able to revoke any order or regulation made under the declaration.
Gold said the committee would not have the required clearance to review confidential security information, in response to a question from Sen. Dennis Patterson.
“There is a certain amount of ‘trust us’ in the government’s justification for these extreme measures we are debating today,” said Patterson, who recently left the Conservative Senate caucus over that party’s support for the protests.
He later added in the debate: “I’m still really concerned about how you can have serious oversight unless you have access to all the relevant information, and I’m sorry, ‘trusting us’ is not good enough for me and probably not for many Canadians.”
Sen. Jim Quinn, who worked for decades with the Coast Guard, noted that “it’s very difficult, having worked in emergency situations in another life, to not be able to have access to all that vital information to help the decision-making process.”
A motion creating the committee needs to be passed in both chambers, and the House of Commons is off until next week. Government House Leader Mark Holland tweeted Monday that he’s had “productive discussions” on the committee’s membership, but offered no timeline for when it would be in place.
“This is extraordinarily important and we are a week or more into the application of the declaration of emergency and we do not have a committee in place,” said Sen. Frances Lankin. “I would have thought it would be up and running now.”
Lankin said she hoped the committee would be created and ready to get to work immediately by the time the Senate votes on the declaration of emergency.

Horwath's in same lane as Ford? What?

Full text: Four years ago Doug Ford promised us buck-a-beer.
Now, he is back to buying ballots with baubles. The bottles of beer are long forgotten - cheap suds in corner stores was a memorable slogan but an undeliverable promise.
Look instead to new pocketbook pitches and press lines from the premier on the campaign trail:
Road tolls? Removed.
Licence renewals? Rebated.
It's all about the appeal of affordability.
If that sounds like the familiar Progressive Conservative playbook, you're right. Now, the New Democratic Party has learned the lesson of Ford's 2018 election victory:
If political leftists can't beat the right-wing premier at his own game, they might as well join him in cutting government revenues. Which is why the loudest victory lap, after Ford's Tories rescinded tolls in Durham, came from NDP Leader Andrea Horwath.
"Today is a victory," Horwath exulted after Ford's announcement, congratulating her Oshawa MPP Jennifer French, a New Democrat facing a tough re-election battle against the Tories, and the local activists she teamed up with to "free the 412 and 418" highways. Never mind that Bob Rae's NDP government pioneered toll roads with Highway 407 in the 1990s, today's New Democrats are firmly opposed.
Next, Horwath announced she was going along with Ford's campaign-style announcement Tuesday to remove the annual licence plate renewal fee. It wasn't an NDP priority, she pointed out - small beer, perhaps - yet Horwath pointedly refused to say how she would make up the money to pay for her party's other priorities.
While many will surely be pleased that the pesky payments are now history, Ford's decision will cost the treasury an estimated $1 billion yearly. It's hardly surprising that the tax-fighting Tories are keen to reduce revenues (and then squeeze services when an inevitable cash crunch arises).
But why would the second-place NDP, which is campaigning hard to form Ontario's next government, be auditioning for the role of tax fighters?
"When it comes to the amount of money that's being refunded, all of those pieces, I'm not particularly opposed to it," Horwath told reporters.
Yet in the same breath, she restated NDP priorities to spend more on education, housing, health care, long-term care and child care. Where would that money come from?
If Horwath doesn't have a ready answer - like, for example, that the pandemic reminded Ontarians of the vital importance of funding health care and other essential public services - Ford surely does: "We believe hardworking Ontarians know the value of a dollar, and the best place for your money is in your pocket, not the government's pocket," the premier proclaimed Tuesday.
At a 9 a.m. photo-op in vote-rich Richmond Hill, during which he snubbed the first sitting of the legislature since the onset of the Omicron wave more than two months ago, Ford mused about the economics of pocketbook politics. The premier didn't just waive future license fees, he promised rebate cheques for those who have paid for renewals over the past two years - which means envelopes will land on your doorstep, conveniently, just a few weeks before the June 2 vote:
"It's actually your money, it's everyone's money out there, it's not the government's money - we're just putting that back into your pocket. And it's about affordability."
Ah, affordability. Ford boasted that reducing renewals will save the average driver $120 a year (northerners pay half that).
Admittedly, the annual fee might be a nuisance that could easily be made up elsewhere - higher gas taxes, for example. But a hardship for hardworking voters?
In fact, the $120 annual renewal fee amounts to a mere 0.24 per cent of the total outlay for the average new car, which now exceeds $50,000. Of course, if your family own two cars, you'll save up to $240 a year - but that means you can also afford to own and operate two vehicles.
Why then is Horwath's NDP now on the same page as Ford's Tories on user fees? For one thing, it's a good way for the two rival parties to team up against the hated Liberals led by Steven Del Duca, who was transportation minister when that toll road was opened in Durham.
"We're getting rid of tolls that were brought in by the last Liberal government on Highways 412 and 418," Ford stressed (while dodging questions about why his government has publicly defended those tolls until now).
As for Del Duca's Liberals, they have been lying low, lest they get caught out for imposing tolls and fees in power only to have second thoughts now that they're in opposition. That hasn't stopped the Liberals from lapsing into the same "affordability" lines used by the NDP and Tories.
Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner, however, was having none of it. After listening to Horwath evade reporters' questions on where she would make up the money, Tuesday, he marched up to the microphone to call out Ford - and the other leaders:
Schreiner condemned the fee cut as a "billion-dollar election boondoggle that means less money for health care, less money for education, less money for affordable housing. I absolutely oppose what the premier is doing."
The problem, Schreiner added, is that his rivals are dancing around the cost implications by "playing footsie with this election gimmick."
Footsie indeed. The flip side of affordability is authenticity. It's hard to promise cuts while also pledging to maintain services and still keep a straight face.

Full text: Ottawa police are looking into controversial Twitter activity from Independent MPP Randy Hillier, who urged supporters of the so-called "Freedom Convoy" to "keep calling" emergency phone lines in the nation's capital as the protest was being dispersed.
The revelation follows a move by Ontario's legislature to again censure the former Progressive Conservative for "conduct that is inappropriate and unbecoming of a member."
"We are aware of the claims and Ottawa police is reviewing the social media posts," Const. Paramjit Singh said Wednesday in a statement to the Star.
At Queen's Park, Government House Leader Paul Calandra said the latest censure of Hillier (Lanark-Frontenac-Kingston) means he will not be allowed to rise and make remarks in the legislature unless he apologizes.
"In the very, very near future he'll have the opportunity to have the attention of the legislature for a bill of his choosing and we want to make sure that he understands that the speaker has the authority to not recognize him," Calandra said.
"We as a legislature condemn unanimously ... what he has written. We condemn his behaviour," added Calandra. "We're not going to give him a legislative platform to express opinions that are completely off-step."
It was not immediately clear if Hillier intends to use his pending time slot to propose a private member's bill, or what it might be. Hillier did not reply to a request for comment from the Star on Wednesday.
A Saturday evening Twitter post from the eastern Ontario MPP commented on an Ottawa police tweet asking people to "stop calling critical emergency and operational phone lines to express displeasure about the police action" as officers were clearing out trucks and protesters from the downtown area near Parliament Hill.
Hillier retweeted it, telling his 56,000 followers: "Keep calling in a democracy expressing yourself is a fundamental freedom #FreedomConvoy2022."
It was the latest in a series of social media posts that have put Hillier - who Premier Doug Ford ejected from the PC caucus in 2019 - under close scrutiny. They include calling federal Transport Minister Omar Alghabra, who is Muslim, a "terrorist" in January and posting information about Ontarians whom he wrongly claimed had died from COVID-19 vaccinations. He was censured for that in October.
Hillier told the Star on Tuesday that "there was no mention of 911" in his weekend tweet, adding, "I don't generally apologize for other people's mistakes or wrongful attributions."
Calandra said Hillier remains entitled to vote in the legislature and noted members can be expelled if they are charged and convicted with criminal offences.

PCs propose moving budget deadline to April: Critics accuse Ford government of changing timing as campaign tactic

Full text: The Ford government is proposing the Ontario budget deadline be pushed back until the end of April - a move opposition critics are calling a campaign tactic given the provincial election is on June 2.
Moving the budget deadline to April 30 is "just so we can have a real feel, to know where our finances are after March 31," which is the end of the current fiscal year, said Nina Tangri, associate minister of small business and red tape reduction.
"We're at the point now where we are starting to withdraw or move out of the COVID restrictions, the economy is starting to open up again, the supports that had been coming from the federal government are ending and some of those other COVID supports that we had in place are also coming to an end," said Government House Leader Paul Calandra.
"I think a little bit more time to ensure that we have an accurate reflection of where we are and where we're going is really the impetus behind it."
But critics said the change will leave municipalities and community organizations in limbo for up to a month. Tangri said the province is already working with them.
NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said Premier Doug Ford should instead be presenting the budget early "to start solving the problems that people are facing. Instead, he's paying attention to his own political benefit."
She called the government's explanation for the move "balderdash ... the games the government is playing around budget timing and budget numbers is shameful."
Tangri's omnibus bill, the Fewer Fees, Better Services Act, introduced Tuesday, would also eliminate licence plate sticker renewal fees - which run as high as $120 in parts of the province - and reimburse Ontario drivers for any they have paid since March 2020, remove tolls from highways 412 and 418 in Durham Region as well as cut the size of the board of governors at the financially troubled Laurentian University in Sudbury by more than a third.
It would also amend the Ford government's own 2019 legislation that set a March 31 due date for the yearly budget - an act that also imposes a financial penalty on the premier and finance minister for missing that deadline.
In 2020, because of the pandemic, a full budget was not delivered in time and both Premier Doug Ford and then-finance minister Rod Phillips paid fines equal to 10 per cent of their cabinet top-up pay, or $9,200 and $4,900 respectively.
Liberal MPP Mitzie Hunter, a member of the standing committee on finance and economic affairs, said the government was asked for more consultation on the budget "and we were shut down."
Now, she added, "the government is going to punt the date four weeks later because it's convenient to Doug Ford and his electioneering. I don't see how this helps business, how it helps the economy."
Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner said the delay will only upset "municipalities, social service agencies, non-profits and other community organizations that rely on government funding that now have to wait an additional month to understand what the provincial budget is going to be."
The government, he added, "is going to use it as an election document to launch their election and that's why they want to delay as long as possible."
He also said the premier and Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy "should uphold the spirit of the law they brought in" and pay a fine.
Liberal MPP John Fraser, former interim leader of the party, said "putting it up to April 30 is literally right on top of writ day" and there may not be time to properly debate or even pass it.

Can Del Duca pull off a miracle?

Full text: The Ontario Liberals have never been here before - only seven seats in the legislature, short on cash, constantly trailing in the polls, and led by a guy who most people couldn't pick out in a grocery-store lineup.
To top it off, their former leader, Kathleen Wynne, admits she "wrecked the Liberal party" when the party suffered its worst defeat ever in 2018.
With fewer than 100 days to go before the June 2 provincial election, the outlook for party leader Steven Del Duca and the struggling Liberals looks grim.
Indeed, party insiders concede their best-case scenario, at least at this moment, is to hold Doug Ford to a minority government and have the Liberals finish ahead of the New Democrats.
While the election won't officially start until late April, the campaigns are already well underway. Duelling ad campaigns will start in earnest in the coming days and the parties have already started to trickle out campaign promises, such as Ford's billion-dollar pledge this week to give rebates for vehicle licence renewal fees and to drop tolls on highways 412 and 418 in Durham Region.
But can Del Duca pull off a miracle? Can he lead the Liberals from third place to first in a single election? More importantly, how can he step up his game?
Long-time Liberal strategists and campaign organizers interviewed in recent days provide a few starting ideas:
Show energy Del Duca concedes he lacks charisma, but he needs to be dynamic, especially in the critical first 10 days of the campaign when he can make an impression on voters and get them to say to themselves, "Gee, this guy is not as bad as I thought."
Hire an image consultant One veteran organizer says Del Duca is seen as "just a guy, not a leader." To counter that, it's time the party brought in an image consultant, ditch the thick-framed glasses, be seen exercising and getting fit. Both Stephen Harper and Dalton McGuinty got some expert advice years ago and it worked to a good measure for both.
Highlight the team Del Duca needs to show off his top new candidates, those who could be ministers of finance, education and health. In short, the Liberals need to be seen as having a competent team ready to govern, ready to win - not seen as a party willing to settle for a two-election path.
Go big on three issues Make keeping schools open and properly funded, increasing hospital capacities and improving long-term care the centrepiece of the campaign.
Inspire voters The people of Ontario are exhausted, they're depressed and they're worried. They want to get to the other side of this COVID nightmare, as quickly and safely as possible. Be real. Be honest. Let voters know there are better days ahead.
Respect all voters, not just urban progressives Del Duca needs to convince all voters that the Liberal have their backs, not just those who live in major cities or who hold decent jobs or went to university, but also those who work at low-wage jobs or who live in rural and small-town Ontario. Being told, for example, that climate change is one of your top issues doesn't count much when you're trying to pay the rent or buy groceries at the end of each month.
Be wary of tilting too far to the left Like it or not, there's a growing backlash - not just among right-wingers - to many "politically correct" initiatives, such as mandatory diversity awareness training and changing names of public institutions, such as Ryerson University, because of perceived ties to colonialism and racism.
It's a lot for Del Duca to do, but occasionally miracles do happen.

Full text: TORONTO - Ontario intends to offer financial support for businesses affected by recent protests against COVID-19 measures, the province's finance minister said Tuesday as legislators debated the government's handling of the lengthy demonstrations.
Peter Bethlenfalvy didn't share specifics on targeted aid from the province, but said more details would be coming soon on help for those affected.
"We recognize these are very unique circumstances and that's why I will have more to say in the very near future about supporting those businesses," he said.
Bethlenfalvy made the comments as elected members returned to the provincial legislature for the last session before June's election. It was also the first time representatives formally held a debate since the protests began rocking Ontario communities weeks ago.
Opposition politicians demanded that the Progressive Conservative government commit funding supports for businesses and workers whose jobs were disrupted over the last several weeks. Demonstrators initially rallied against a COVID-19 vaccination mandate for cross-border truckers but the protests turned into a broader movement calling for an end to government pandemic measures.
The federal government has pledged up to $20 million to help cover operational costs for businesses affected by the blockades, in payments of up to $10,000 per business.
Provincial Liberal Lucille Collard, who represents an Ottawa riding, said Tuesday that the province should match that, and called for more details on the incoming supports.
"The province needs to step up, to at least match the federal $20-million fund that is being offered, provide hydro bill forgiveness, a moratorium on evictions, because businesses are worried," she said.
Legislators also criticized the government and Premier Doug Ford for not acting sooner to help end the protests, which lasted three weeks in Ottawa and several days at a key border crossing between Windsor, Ont., and Detroit.
Ford declared a state of emergency on Feb. 11, nearly two weeks after the Ottawa protest began, pledging to enact orders that would fine people up to $100,000 for blocking critical infrastructure and authorizing the removal of licences if people don't comply.
Ford has said that he intends to make permanent some of the temporary measures he enacted to end the blockades.
Major demonstrations had largely been cleared and several key protest leaders had been arrested as of Tuesday. But law enforcement and governments were still bracing for possible follow-up actions.
Toronto Police had closed roads around the provincial legislature, as they have on-and-off for weeks, in preparation for possible attempts to set up blockades of vehicles like the one that clogged up downtown Ottawa. The closures around Queen's Park were starting to lift Tuesday afternoon, with plans to relax them over the course of the next day or so.
Meanwhile, New Democrat Leader Andrea Horwath asked Tuesday if the government would "acknowledge their role in letting that hate fester for three and a half weeks in the city of Ottawa and dividing this province." She also specifically asked Ford to apologize to residents in Ottawa and Windsor.
Liberal House Leader John Fraser also questioned Ford's leadership throughout the crisis.
"How can any community in Ontario have confidence that this Premier will be there for them and not abandon them the way that he did the people of Ottawa and Windsor in this situation," he said.
Solicitor General Sylvia Jones responded to criticism by saying that the province couldn't direct police to act but did provide resources to help. She said it was a challenging time but collaboration between police forces that eventually cleared the demonstrations showed the value of working together.
"I'm proud of the work that they have done and I am proud of the work that has happened as a result: safely being able to deal with these illegal operations," Jones said.
Ford was not present in the legislature for the first question period debate of the sitting.
Earlier in the morning, he was at a car dealership in Richmond Hill, Ont., just north of Toronto to make a campaign-style announcement about a plan to eliminate licence plate renewal fees.
The premier was non-committal, however, on a pledge from the 2018 election to cut gas prices, and said he would "look into" it.
The gas tax is one of several question marks remaining ahead of the June 2 election. It's expected that the government's annual budget will lay out much of the Progressive Conservative election platform.
That spending plan was expected by the end of March, but on Tuesday the government introduced an amendment that would push the deadline back to April 30, "to allow the government to introduce the 2022 budget at a time when it can better assess the effects of the reopening of the economy and introduce a plan for recovery."
This report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 22, 2022.

Full text: OTTAWA — As the political fires generated by weeks of cross-Canada protests and the Liberal government’s subsequent emergency declaration start to subside, the Conservative party’s leadership race is heating up.
The only official candidate, Pierre Poilievre, is fundraising off the controversy, and conservative polling firms that have helped past leadership candidates are in the field to see where the base stands on it all.
Meanwhile, the base of support is expanding for a potential candidacy by former Quebec premier Jean Charest, while supporters of social conservative and former candidate Leslyn Lewis are actively asking members if they’d back another leadership bid by the rookie MP.
The flurry of movement comes even though there are no official rules set for the contest, nor a voting date for party members to elect a replacement for Erin O’Toole.
That’s not stopping Team Poilievre, which sent a letter Monday afternoon seeking donations for his campaign, along with a link to his speech in the House of Commons opposing the emergency declaration.
The letter notes the race hasn’t started yet, and donors won’t be able to get tax receipts, but hopes they can kick in some cash anyway for the first stages of the campaign.
“Pierre is a fighter,” reads the letter from longtime Poilievre supporter Jenni Byrne.
“He’s fought for his constituents and he’s fought for Canadians across the country.”
On Tuesday, Poilievre was formally relieved of his duties as the party’s finance critic, a move many insiders complained had taken too long — convention holds that leadership candidates don’t hold high-profile critic jobs that can provide them with additional profile in the House of Commons.
The seven-term MP entered the race just four days after the Conservative caucus ejected O’Toole as leader.
Poilievre has a stockpile of MP endorsements, but there are factions within the party that are less enthused.
One is Campaign Life Coalition, which has made it clear that it can’t endorse Poilievre because of his progressive social views, which it says even his supporters must be cautious about.
“The fiscal conservative, democratic conservative and libertarian factions of the party’s base need to recognize that this inherent danger exists with Poilievre’s social liberalism. Why?” the socially conservative group wrote in an email blast last week.
“A man who compromises on moral values can be too easily pushed to compromise on economic and freedom principles, also.”
Campaign Life has its eye on Lewis to potentially carry the torch again in this campaign.
Lewis finished third in the party’s 2020 leadership race, thanks in part to her strong socially conservative credentials.
On the weekend, an email from “Team Leslyn” went out to party members and others asking if they’d back her this time around as well, and asking for their contact information.
Then there are those from the other end of the political spectrum.
Alain Rayes stepped down as the party’s deputy leader earlier this month, citing his desire to support a candidate in the leadership race who represents progressive values and centre-right economic ideas.
Rayes is among the Conservative MPs who put their names on an open letter to Charest on Tuesday, telling the former Progressive Conservative leader and Mulroney-era cabinet minister that Canada needs him to run.
“There is no doubt that Jean Charest would be the best person to lead our party and our country,” Rayes said on social media, referring to Charest as an “an experienced and qualified statesman.”
Crucial for Charest’s nascent campaign is showcasing his appeal outside Quebec; among others, the letter is signed by Rick Perkins, a Nova Scotia MP who defeated the Liberals’ fisheries minister in the last election; John Nater, an Ontario MP; and Percy Mockler, a New Brunswick senator.
In the 2020 leadership race, Perkins helped run Peter MacKay’s campaign, a bid Mockler also endorsed.
MacKay is rumoured to be considering another leadership bid, but still has around $400,000 of debt from the last contest.
Late last week, a polling firm that worked with his 2020 campaign was making calls asking respondents if they’d support MacKay, Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown, Poilievre or Charest.
Pollsters were in the field just after the Liberals announced they were using the Emergencies Act to give police and others new powers in a bid to end nearly three weeks of protests in downtown Ottawa and to stave off renewed blockades at the nation’s borders.
The polling company asked respondents whether they agreed with the viewpoints espoused by the protesters, and whether they thought their tactics went too far.
This week, Conservatives voted against the emergency declaration, but the debate showcased a range of positions on the issue.
Some Conservative MPs continue to insist that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ought to have met with the protesters, and described the demonstrations in Ottawa as little more than a nuisance, while others said all politicians need to do some soul searching about how and why the protests began.
“I am left to consider whether I could have been quicker to call out abhorrent behaviour, or how I could have shown greater empathy to my neighbours,” said Tory MP Adam Chambers (Simcoe North).
“What can I do now to be a positive actor inside and outside of the House?”

Full text: TORONTO - An Opposition bill aimed at fighting Islamophobia and other hate crimes was tabled in Ontario's legislature Wednesday, but it was unclear if it would receive the support of the majority Progressive Conservative government.
The bill from the New Democrats, if passed, would establish a provincial review of hate crimes and hate-motivated incidents that happen in Ontario.
It would also designate safe zones around houses of worship, prevent white supremacist groups from registering as societies and establish an anti-racism council that would provide input on government policies.
The bill, which was created with the National Council of Canadian Muslims and follows similar recommendations put forward by that organization, would also present new tools for schools to combat racism. Additionally, it would empower the Speaker to ban protests at the legislature that promote hate.
Faisal Hassan, an NDP legislator who represents a Toronto riding, introduced the bill on Wednesday afternoon, saying "it is time for bold, concrete action to tackle Islamophobia and hate in Ontario." The bill, called the "Our London Family Act," was named for the Afzaal family, victims of a deadly truck attack in London, Ont., last year.
"This is not a partisan issue, it is a moral one," Hassan told the legislature. "I hope and trust that all members of the house will support Our London Family Act and we are able to pass this very important legislation as soon as possible."
Other Opposition parties have said they will support the bill. But the governing Progressive Conservatives - who hold a majority of seats and have the power to determine the fate of legislation - have not yet said how their members will vote.
House leader Paul Calandra said early on Wednesday that the government would take a look at the details once the legislation had been tabled.
Liberal House Leader John Fraser said the bill was a very important piece of legislation. "If you look around at what's happening in Canada right now, it's even more important," he said.
NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said she was happy the Liberals and the legislature's Green member agreed to support the bill after outreach to all parties.
"We're hoping that the government does the same. Why? because this is exactly what the community asked for," she said.
Salman Afzaal, his wife Madiha Salman, their 15-year-old daughter Yumna and her 74-year-old grandmother, Talat Afzaal, died after they were struck by a vehicle during an evening walk on June 6, 2021. Nine-year-old Fayez Afzaal was seriously hurt but survived.
Police have alleged the attack was motivated by hate and prosecutors argue the man charged with four counts of murder and one of attempted murder committed an act of terrorism.
Another man, Mohamed-Aslim Zafis, was stabbed and killed outside a Toronto mosque in 2020. A man has been charged with murder in Zafis' death and police have said that they cannot discount that the random attack was motivated by hate.
Sabena Islam, the cousin of one of those killed in the London attack, spoke at an NDP news conference on Wednesday about her own experiences with Islamophobia. She called the legislation "a chance to do something meaningful and long-lasting" to honour the memories of those who died in London.
Islam urged government members - and Premier Doug Ford in particular - to support the legislation as "the first step in this journey towards an Ontario free of Islamophobia and hate."
"It is your job to keep us safe, and we are counting on you to do so," Islam said.
The bill is due to be debated on March 10, the NDP said.
This report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 23, 2022.

Full text: What purportedly began as a convoy of protesters saying they were opposed to a vaccination mandate for cross-border truckers became an illegal occupation as hundreds of semi trucks parked end-to-end in downtown Ottawa, paralyzing Parliament Hill.
Jan. 14 — Alberta woman Tamara Lich launched a fundraiser on GoFundMe for “Freedom Convoy 2022.”
Jan. 26 — Jason LaFace, one of the organizers of the convoy said during an interview on Kitchener Today, “This is no longer about the mandate anymore. This is about Canada, this is about our rights and how the government’s been manipulating the population and oppressing us all the time.”
“We’re getting the rest of our signatures and we’re having them compel the government to dissolve.” “[Justin] Trudeau is a criminal in this country, he needs to go.”
Jan. 27 — GoFundMe released $1 million in donations to truckers as trucks massed outside Ottawa.
Jan. 28 — Hundreds of trucks arrived in downtown Ottawa as the first wave of the protest.
Jan. 29 — About 3,000 big rigs and other trucks, as well as more than 15,000 protesters converged in downtown Ottawa. Protesters were seen drinking and dancing on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the National War Memorial, and others in the crowd draped flags and anti-vaccine signs on the Terry Fox statue. Some people openly display racist symbols such as swastikas and Confederate flags.
Jan. 30 — Ottawa police launched a criminal investigation into the desecration of the National War Memorial and statue of Terry Fox. They said they would also be investigating threatening behaviour shown toward police officers, workers and other private citizens.
Feb. 2 — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in French in the House of Commons that the federal government is working with the Ottawa police to put an end to the ongoing trucker protest, “which is now becoming illegal.”
Feb. 2 — GoFundMe paused the “Freedom Convoy 2022” campaign for the convoy protest, saying it wants to ensure that the fundraiser complies with its terms of service.
Feb. 2 — A new fundraiser “Freedom Convoy 2022,” created by Tamara Lich on Christian fundraising site GiveSendGo, became active.
Feb. 4 — GoFundMe pulled the plug on the Freedom Convoy 2022 campaign, which had collected more than $10 million. The site said it initially believed the demonstration was going to be peaceful but withdrew its support after police and local leaders raised concerns it had become an “occupation” with police reports of violence and other unlawful activity.
Feb. 6 — Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson declared a state of emergency in the city over ongoing protests. In a news release, the city said the decision “reflects the serious danger and threat to the safety and security of residents posed by the ongoing demonstrations.”
Feb. 10 — The Ontario government successfully petitioned a court to freeze access to millions of dollars donated through online fundraising platform GiveSendGo.
Feb. 11 — Ontario Premier Doug Ford declared a state of emergency in an effort to put an end to the “siege” in Ottawa and Windsor, where truck convoy protests continued to disrupt traffic and prevent the transport of goods across the Canadian border. He called the Ottawa protest “an illegal occupation.”
“​​We’re now two weeks into the siege of the city of Ottawa. I call it a siege because that’s what it is. It’s an illegal occupation. This is no longer a protest,” Ford said.
Feb. 14 — Trudeau said he invoked the Emergencies Act to bring to an end the anti-government blockades he described as illegal and not about peaceful protest.
Feb. 15 — Ottawa Police Chief Peter Sloly resigned after weeks of criticism aimed at his handling of the protests.
Feb. 17 — Organizers Chris Barber and Tamara Lich were arrested. Lich’s bank account had already been frozen.
Feb. 18 — A massive police operation unfolded in downtown Ottawa to remove the three-week old phalanx of trucks and protesters from city streets.
Feb. 20 — Ottawa authorities cleared much of the city’s downtown area of the Freedom Convoy vehicles.

More details sought on new powers: As debate begins, senators say they've been left in dark on why Emergencies Act was invoked

Full text: Ahead of a crucial vote in the Senate on whether to confirm the government's decision to invoke the Emergencies Act, senators lamented that they've been kept in the dark about the ongoing need for the unprecedented measure.
Debate on the declaration of emergency kicked off in the upper chamber Tuesday with senators expressing concern about when a parliamentary committee will be struck to provide oversight of the declaration, and the limitations on information that would be provided.
"There's no blockades today. What emergency exists today that convinces the government hour by hour that this has to continue?" said Sen. Scott Tannas in a question to government representative Sen. Marc Gold.
"What emergency exists today, other than some secret emergency that you can't tell anybody about and our oversight committee won't get to know about either?"
The federal government invoked the Emergencies Act for the first time in history Feb. 14 to deal with the weeks-long occupation in Ottawa by so-called "Freedom Convoy" protesters and blockades at border crossings.
The protesters, who objected to COVID-19 vaccination requirements and pandemic-related public health restrictions, have now been cleared and ports of entry are open for trade and travel.
However, the government still needs the Senate to sign off on its declaration of an emergency. If the motion to approve it fails, the declaration will be revoked immediately. A vote is expected this week.
A motion confirming the declaration passed in the House of Commons Monday evening in a 185-151 vote with the New Democrats voting in support of the Liberal minority government.
It's not so clear how the Senate will vote, given that most members of the upper chamber are not affiliated with a political party and the Senate groups allow free votes.
Gold found himself on his feet repeatedly Tuesday, responding to senators who argued they lacked access to information on the ongoing security situation.
"Are we not creating a dangerous precedent for the future?" asked Sen. Julie Miville-Dechêne. "Could this exceptional law be invoked again solely on the basis of secret information, which obviously would be difficult to accept in a democracy?"
Sen. Elizabeth Marshall said it seemed like the federal government went from doing nothing at the beginning of the convoy protests to taking the "big step" of invoking the act.
"We've received general explanations as to the thought process that went into invoking the act," she said, pressing Gold for specifics. "This is a serious step we're contemplating here today. What exactly happened that the government decided to invoke the act?"
Gold reiterated throughout the day that there is plenty of information on the public record as to why the government invoked the act and feels that the declaration must remain in place for now. This includes protesters remaining in the vicinity of Ottawa, the possibility of new border blockades, and ongoing police investigations.
"The government is not relying upon a 'Trust me, I know things you don't know' approach," Gold said.
But his colleagues demanded to know why there would be limitations on the sensitive information that could be shared with a joint House-Senate committee that must be created to review the exercise of powers under the declaration.
The committee would be able to revoke any order or regulation made under the declaration.
Gold said the committee would not have the required clearance to review confidential security information, in response to a question from Sen. Dennis Patterson.
"There is a certain amount of 'trust us' in the government's justification for these extreme measures we are debating today," said Patterson, who recently left the Conservative Senate caucus over that party's support for the protests.
He later added in the debate: "I'm still really concerned about how you can have serious oversight unless you have access to all the relevant information, and I'm sorry, 'trusting us' is not good enough for me and probably not for many Canadians."
Sen. Jim Quinn, who worked for decades with the Coast Guard, noted that "it's very difficult, having worked in emergency situations in another life, to not be able to have access to all that vital information to help the decision-making process."
A motion creating the committee needs to be passed in both chambers, and the House of Commons is off until next week. Government House Leader Mark Holland tweeted Monday that he's had "productive discussions" on the committee's membership, but offered no timeline for when it would be in place.
"This is extraordinarily important and we are a week or more into the application of the declaration of emergency and we do not have a committee in place," said Sen. Frances Lankin. "I would have thought it would be up and running now."
Lankin said she hoped the committee would be created and ready to get to work immediately by the time the Senate votes on the declaration of emergency.

Ford promises rebates for plate renewals: Billion-dollar plan criticized as drain on coffers

Full text: The cheque is in the mail - almost.
Premier Doug Ford is promising rebates to millions of Ontario vehicle owners for the licence renewal fees they paid during the pandemic, and will scrap the fees and renewal stickers going forward.
As first reported by the Star early this month, the billion-dollar plan comes with the June 2 election just weeks away.
Rebates should be sent out beginning in late March and through April to almost eight million owners of passenger cars, light trucks, motorcycles and mopeds.
"After two years of the pandemic, people don't need any more hurdles getting back on their feet and back to normal," Ford said Tuesday in Richmond Hill, touting the end of long-standing licence renewal fees as an affordability measure.
"People have been hurt so much over this pandemic and that's a billion dollars back into the economy," added Ford, who was not in question period to face opposition parties as the legislature resumed sitting for the first time since early December.
"It's actually your money ... the worst place to give your money is to the government."
The fees range from $120 a year for passenger cars in southern Ontario to $12 for mopeds.
New Democrat Leader Andrea Horwath said the relief is "gimmicky" and joined the Liberals and Greens warning it could mean less money in provincial coffers to, for example, reduce surgery backlogs caused by COVID-19.
Green Leader Mike Schreiner called it "a billion-dollar election boondoggle that means less money for health care, less money for education, loss money for affordable housing" with the election campaign set to officially begin in early May.
The plan, which takes effect March 13, comes as the province is recording multibillion-dollar deficits because of the expensive fight against COVID-19, and as gasoline prices are soaring.
Ford has not yet fulfilled the second half of his 2018 election promise to cut the price of gasoline by 10 cents a litre. He said he would do that by cancelling the previous Liberal government's 4.3 cent a litre carbon levy - which he did - and by cutting the provincial gas tax by 5.7 cents, which has not yet happened.
Legislation was to be introduced Tuesday to enable the refunds of fees paid since March 2020.
Motorists will be mailed refunds provided they have paid outstanding traffic or parking fines, fees and road tolls. There are no changes to renewal fees and requirements for licence plate stickers on heavy commercial vehicles and snowmobiles. Drivers will be required to pay $90 to renew driver's licences every five years.

Full text: Police gave a master class over the weekend in how to end a mass protest that had developed into an illegal occupation of downtown Ottawa.
Local police were supported by officers from many forces across Ontario and Quebec. They developed a comprehensive plan to end the occupation, and they executed it with minimum force.
They showed determination combined with patience. It took two full days and nights to move out the demonstrators, clear away the trucks, and restore order to the streets of Ottawa. It was an impressive display of both force and restraint.
Now we’re left to deal with the mess left behind — both the detritus on the streets of Ottawa and the political legacy of anger, distrust and open hatred on open display over the past month.
To begin with, the House of Commons was preparing on Monday to vote in favour of the Emergencies Act, with New Democrats joining Liberals in approving use of this extraordinary measure.
We were skeptical when the government invoked the act on Feb. 14. Border blockades were already being ended without use of the act, and the government did not make a convincing case that those disruptions and the Ottawa occupation amounted to a national emergency in the sense of the law.
In fact, the federal government was reaching for the sledgehammer of the Emergencies Act because of the abject failure of other levels of government.
The City of Ottawa and its local police force were helpless. And the government that should have stepped forward to make sure police had the resources they needed — the provincial government of Doug Ford — went AWOL. It acted as though Ottawa was in some other jurisdiction entirely, instead of being Ontario’s second largest city.
So in came the feds, declaring a national emergency and finally giving police the political encouragement they obviously needed to take action.
It’s still not clear whether the powers of the federal Emergencies Act were needed to clear the streets of Ottawa.
The government says it gave police the power to set up “secure areas,” including much of central Ottawa and ban people from entering without good reason, thereby reducing the number of people joining the protesters.
And it says the act gave it the power to freeze bank accounts and credit cards of leaders of the protest, and to stop foreign funds from being directed to the so-called Freedom Convoy.
Those are strong powers, and they should not be used lightly. It’s possible to oppose the goals and conduct of the convoy protesters strongly, and still worry that reaching for the most extreme federal emergency power sets a worrisome precedent.
But that precedent has now been set, with Parliament’s approval. It’s less important to hash over what might have been than to make sure any risk of government overreach is minimized in the coming days.
In that regard it was encouraging on Monday to hear Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stating that the government does not intend to use the Emergencies Act a day longer than necessary.
The law is certainly nothing like the threat to civil liberties posed by the War Measures Act it replaced. But the whole point is that it gives the government extraordinary powers to deal with a real emergency, and to the extent that the emergency has been dealt with, the justification for special powers vanishes.
There’s a good case to be made for giving government new powers to deal with occupation-style protests and blockades. In particular, the money behind such movements must be controlled.
It’s now time for the government to make that case and seek approval from Parliament for such powers. They should not be rushed in under the cover of an emergency whose urgency is rapidly ebbing.

Full text: As the political fires generated by weeks of cross-Canada protests and the Liberal government's subsequent emergency declaration start to subside, the Conservative party's leadership race is heating up.
The only official candidate, Pierre Poilievre, is fundraising off the controversy, and conservative polling firms that have helped past leadership candidates are in the field to see where the base stands on it all.
Meanwhile, the base of support is expanding for a potential candidacy by former Quebec premier Jean Charest, while supporters of social conservative and former candidate Leslyn Lewis are actively asking members if they'd back another leadership bid by the rookie MP.
The flurry of movement comes even though there are no official rules set for the contest nor a voting date for party members to elect a replacement for Erin O'Toole.
That's not stopping Team Poilievre, which sent a letter Monday seeking donations for his campaign, along with a link to his speech in the House of Commons opposing the emergency declaration.
The letter notes the race hasn't started yet, and donors won't be able to get tax receipts, but hopes they can kick in some cash anyway for the first stages of the campaign.
"Pierre is a fighter," reads the letter from longtime Poilievre supporter Jenni Byrne. "He's fought for his constituents and he's fought for Canadians across the country."
On Tuesday, Poilievre was formally relieved of his duties as finance critic, a move many insiders complained had taken too long - convention holds that leadership candidates don't hold high-profile critic jobs that can provide them with additional profile in the House of Commons.
The seven-term MP entered the race just four days after the Conservative caucus ejected O'Toole as leader.
Poilievre has a stockpile of MP endorsements, but there are factions within the party that are less enthused.
One is Campaign Life Coalition, which has made it clear that it can't endorse Poilievre because of his progressive social views, which it says even his supporters must be cautious about. Instead, Campaign Life has its eye on Lewis to potentially carry the torch again in this campaign.
Lewis finished third in the party's 2020 leadership race, thanks in part to her strong socially conservative credentials.
On the weekend, an email from "Team Leslyn" went out to party members and others asking if they'd back her this time around as well, and asking for their contact information.
Then there are those from the other end of the political spectrum.
Alain Rayes stepped down as the party's deputy leader this month, citing his desire to support a candidate in the leadership race who represents progressive values and centre-right economic ideas.
Rayes is among the Conservative MPs who put their names on an open letter to Charest on Tuesday, telling the former Progressive Conservative leader and Mulroney-era cabinet minister that Canada needs him to run.
Crucial for Charest's nascent campaign is showcasing his appeal outside Quebec; among others, the letter is signed by Rick Perkins, a Nova Scotia MP who defeated the Liberals' fisheries minister in the last election; John Nater, an Ontario MP; and Percy Mockler, a New Brunswick senator.
Peter MacKay is rumoured to be considering another bid, but still has around $400,000 of debt from the last contest.
Pollsters were in the field just after the Liberals announced they were using the Emergencies Act to give police and others new powers in a bid to end nearly three weeks of protests in downtown Ottawa and to stave off renewed blockades at the nation's borders.
The polling company asked respondents whether they agreed with the viewpoints espoused by the protesters or whether they thought their tactics went too far. This week, Conservatives voted against the emergency declaration, but the debate showcased a range of positions on the issue.

Full text: What is inflation really, and how is it best reduced?
BoC under pressure as inflation jumps to 5.1 per cent, Feb. 17
Why is every increase in the cost of living inflation?
If there is a perfectly good explanation for a price to increase due to operation of the market system, how is that inflation?
If the Bank of Canada raises interest rates, why is that not inflation?
Prices rise when the cost of money rises. Raising interest rates spreads the misery, but how much pain is inflicted, compared to any real benefit in stopping true inflation?
If governments were serious about knocking inflation down, wouldn't tax policy work best? Raising the HST by 0.25 per cent would be far more effective than the trickle down result of a quarter point rise in the bank rate.
John Wilkins, Toronto
Remember lack of leadership in June's election
The Star reported that Alberta Premier Jason Kenney will challenge the federal government's use of the Emergencies Act and stated "Alberta has all the necessary statutory powers and operational capacity for enforcement."
If true, Ontario has these same powers and capacity for enforcement and begs the question, why didn't Premier Doug Ford use his authority?
Instead, Ford let the situation get out of control, particularly in Ottawa, for far too long, thus forcing the federal government to act. I reckon Ford was looking for someone else to provide the needed leadership.
I'll remember this on June 2.

What's in a number? Not that much
Why is Tuesday so special? In numerology, 2/22/2022 marks a 'moment of alignment,' Feb. 22
We are living in a world where we ignore science and rationality at our peril. This has become increasingly clear in view of the continuing global pandemic, not to mention the looming threat of climate catastrophe.
One of the reasons that humans have got where we are is that we have a highly developed ability to recognize patterns and assign agency.
This has been, on balance, beneficial; if you are out in the wild and hear a rustling in the bushes, it's prudent to assume there could be an animal around, and not just the wind.
The disadvantage is that humans are also very good at assigning patterns a significance that is completely unjustified by evidence.
The date 22/02/2022 is certainly a delightful configuration of numbers, and it's easy to further imagine that something really special happens at 2:22.
But how are we supposed to take a publication seriously with an article about the cosmic significance of a string of numbers, which also unselfconsciously includes a request for the numerological expert to "pull some Tarot cards to help illuminate what Feb. 22 has in store?"

Full text: Ford failed Ottawans by passing the buck
The unprecedented, street-wide protest did not have to drag on for three weeks resulting in daily misery to Ottawa citizens if Ontario Premier Doug Ford had simply stepped up and acted responsibly.
When the Ottawa police chief requested provincial police to assist in quelling the protesters, the premier treated Ottawa like the city belonged to another province.
The premier had the responsibility to take charge of the situation, muster provincial policing, declare a city emergency in Ottawa and remove the protesters and their vehicles. Instead, the premier vacillated and let the prime minister take the heat for invoking the Emergencies Act.
It is a failure of the premier's responsibility to the city of Ottawa and its citizens.

Kudos to Menon for thoughtful, insightful column
The misguided 'Freedom Convoy' has thrown Canada under the bus and turned us into America, Feb. 18
These days, when it is so easy to get riled up about anything and everything, I take some old advice to compose an emotional email - wait a few hours before you actually send it.
It gives you a chance to make sure the words and sentiment are correct before you either shine or come across as a blithering idiot.
Thank goodness for Vinay Menon, who not only says exactly what I feel should be said, but says it in a manner which is to the point and echoes common sense.
I have always enjoyed his columns and appreciated his brand of humour, but he has condensed in this article as much of the arguments posed in most of the mainstream journalism.
And yes, I'm awaiting the removal of restrictions just as much as any protester.

Coyote hunting
is just senseless slaughter
The Saturday Debate: Should we allow coyote hunting? Feb. 19
Shooting a totally defenceless, living, breathing and feeling being might have been common many unenlightened decades ago, but killing and possibly maiming a healthy animal for no good reason is no longer acceptable in these far more aware times.
In order for humans to survive on this beleaguered planet, we desperately need to preserve what's left of our environment and everything that shares it with us.
Such mindless and cruel slaughter is offensive and should never be allowed.

Ontario vehicle owners will get rebates for licence plate renewal fees, Doug Ford says

Full text: The cheque is in the mail — almost.
Premier Doug Ford is promising rebates to millions of Ontario vehicle owners for the licence renewal fees they paid during the pandemic, and will scrap the fees and renewal stickers going forward.
As first reported by the Star early this month, the billion-dollar plan comes with the June 2 election just weeks away.
Rebates should be sent out beginning in late March and through April to almost eight million owners of passenger cars, light trucks, motorcycles and mopeds.
“After two years of the pandemic, people don’t need any more hurdles getting back on their feet and back to normal,” Ford said Tuesday in Richmond Hill, touting the end of long-standing licence renewal fees as an affordability measure.
“People have been hurt so much over this pandemic and that’s a billion dollars back into the economy,” added Ford, who was not in question period to face opposition parties as the legislature resumed sitting for the first time since early December.
“It’s actually your money … the worst place to give your money is to the government.”
The fees range from $120 a year for passenger cars in southern Ontario to $12 for mopeds.
New Democrat Leader Andrea Horwath said the relief is “gimmicky” and joined the Liberals and Greens warning it could mean less money in provincial coffers to, for example, reduce surgery backlogs caused by COVID-19.
Green Leader Mike Schreiner called it “a billion-dollar election boondoggle that means less money for health care, less money for education, loss money for affordable housing” with the election campaign set to officially begin in early May.
The plan, which takes effect March 13, comes as the province is recording multibillion-dollar deficits because of the expensive fight against COVID-19, and as gasoline prices are soaring .
Ford has not yet fulfilled the second half of his 2018 election promise to cut the price of gasoline by 10 cents a litre. He said he would do that by cancelling the previous Liberal government’s 4.3-cent-a-litre carbon levy — which he did — and by cutting the provincial gas tax by 5.7 cents, which has not yet happened.
“We’re going to look into that,” the premier told reporters.
Legislation was to be introduced Tuesday to enable the refunds of fees paid since March 2020.
Motorists will be mailed refund cheques providing they have paid any outstanding traffic or parking fines, fees and road tolls.
In other pre-election measures aimed at motorists, Ford is also ending tolls on Highways 412 and 418 east of Toronto starting April 5.
While renewal fees are also being eliminated for most passenger, light duty commercial vehicles, motorcycles and mopeds owned by a company or business, they will not be eligible for the refunds.
Motorists will still have to renew their licence plates at one- or two-year intervals to confirm they have valid insurance and that outstanding fines, fees and tolls are paid.
Without stickers indicating that licences have been renewed, the government will rely on automated licence plate recognition technology to help police, saying such systems can read thousands of plates per minute and flag vehicles of interest such as drivers with suspended licences, stolen vehicles and those named in amber alerts.
Several police forces are already using the technology. Quebec, Saskatchewan, Northwest Territories, Manitoba and Alberta have previously eliminated renewal stickers.
There are no changes to renewal fees and requirements for licence plate stickers on heavy commercial vehicles and snowmobiles.
Drivers will still be required to pay $90 to renew their driver’s licences every five years.

Full text: TORONTO - Pandemic recovery, housing and affordability will be top of mind for Ontario's party leaders as the legislature resumes sitting Tuesday for the last few weeks of the session ahead of a June election.
Premier Doug Ford's Progressive Conservative government has at least one more major piece of legislation - its annual budget - to table before voters head to the polls. The spending plan that's due before the end of March will likely give an early look at the Ford government's re-election platform.
It could include promised cuts to the provincial gas tax, which Ford has said will come before the next budget, or an income-tax cut that was promised in the 2018 election platform. Another unknown in the mix is the pending deal with Ottawa on its $10-a-day child-care plan, which remains in the negotiation stage despite all other provinces and territories signing on.
Measures to tackle skyrocketing home prices in the province - which have nearly tripled in the last decade despite slower income growth - appears to be another area of focus for Ford's government before the session concludes.
A task force focused on housing affordability convened by the provincial government last year recommended in its final report that the province increase density and limit consultations in order to quickly build more homes, among other recommendations. It named a goal of building 1.5 million homes in 10 years.
Housing Minister Steve Clark told The Canadian Press this month that he intends to enact some of the solutions through legislation or regulation at some point before the election.
The housing affordability crisis was also a top issue for the opposition parties that laid out their priorities ahead of the week's session.
New Democrat Leader Andrea Horwath said "brutal" housing costs that have left people unable to afford homes or keep up with skyrocketing rents need to be addressed
Recovery from the pandemic should also be a priority, the Opposition leader said, naming financial supports for businesses, workers and the health system. Her party also intends to table legislation written with the National Council of Canadian Muslims to tackle Islamophobia and racism.
"We know that the election is coming, but we can actually use this session to put forward solutions that will actually help people get through, not only the next couple of months, but recovering from this pandemic," Horwath told reporters on Friday.
She said the government should focus on helping people and not the June election date.
"I hope they prioritize supporting everyday people," she said. "I don't want to see Doug Ford out campaigning for the next three months."
Mike Schreiner of the Ontario Greens, who currently holds his party's only seat in the legislature - with a goal to grow the caucus on June 2 - said addressing housing affordability is also a top priority, along with climate crisis solutions that take affordability concerns into account.
"Greens have solutions to these problems, but it requires the Ford government to work across party and jurisdictional lines and focus (on) what's best for the people of Ontario, not partisan politics," he said.
The Liberals, who will be fighting to regain seats lost after their 2018 defeat to Ford's Tories, also intend to focus on affordability and pandemic response.
The party led by Steven Del Duca intends to call for a finalized child-care deal, expanded access to COVID-19 rapid tests and introduce legislation adding COVID-19 vaccines to a list of immunizations in schools.
This report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 21, 2022.

Althia Raj: Debate rages over government's use of Emergencies Act in convoy crackdown

Full text: It was a ghost town in Ottawa Sunday as the cops cleared the last remaining vestiges of the so-called “Freedom Convoy’s” occupation as a soft dusting of snow seemed to poetically want to cool all the heated rhetoric of the past three weeks.
Inside the House of Commons, however, where debate continued on the government’s use of the Emergencies Act, MPs ratcheted up the temperature.
“I confess I do have trouble seeing how parked trucks, bouncy castles, a big daily barbecue and ball hockey, Canadian flags and singing, and donations for the homeless in front of Parliament meet these [emergency] criteria,” said Lakeland, Alta., MP Shannon Stubbs, one of several Conservative members to downplay the seriousness of the blockades.
“It was like a Canada Day times a thousand. Bigger than any Canada Day that I have ever seen in this country,” said Lianne Rood, Ontario MP for Lambton—Kent—Middlesex, who dismissed the blockade’s extremist elements and described the occupation as joyful.
“There is no al-Qaeda. There is no Taliban. There are no North Korean special forces looking to take over the government,” said Michael Kram, MP for Regina—Wascana. “This is a matter for local law enforcement officials and it is wrong for the government to try to make it out to be anything more than that.”
The Ottawa Police Service, of course, said early on it was unable to bring an end to the protest and requested political assistance. Its interim police chief, Steve Bell, said the measures enacted under the Emergencies Act were key to bringing about an end to the protest.
Ed Fast, MP for Abbotsford, B.C., described the blockades as “peaceful, civil disobedience.” He accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of doing “what his father had done in 1970” of triggering “Canada’s war measures regime.”
While Fast is right that the circumstances in 2022 are different than those of 1970, where the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) bombed mailboxes, kidnapped two officials, and murdered the deputy premier, the Emergencies Act is nowhere near as sweeping as the War Measures Act. There are no soldiers in the street, the measures must be Charter compliant and reviewed by elected officials.
The debate, which should have been a sombre event, was hard to hear at times as Conservatives engaged in small talk rather than listen to the speakers. It degenerated with MPs calling each other names. Michael Cooper, Conservative MP for St. Albert—Edmonton, said Liberal MP for Kingston and the Islands Mark Garretsen was “a despicable human being.” Winnipeg Centre NDP MP Leah Gazan said someone told her: “Why don’t you f--- off.”
Despite lots of what Green Party parliamentary leader Elizabeth May called “toxic” air, valid points were raised during the debate. The use of the Emergencies Act is unprecedented and should not be normalized. It should not be used or be seen to be used to squash dissent.
I heard no MP, however, suggest realistic measures the prime minister could have taken to resolve the blockades. Faced with a similar situation — for example, environmentalists parking hundreds of electric vehicles and building log cabins in the streets of Ottawa — I’m not convinced a Conservative government would have acted differently.
Experts have noted that several of the reasons stated by the government for why the act was necessary — from designating a security perimeter, to outlawing access to minors, to forcing tow-trucks companies to help the police — could have been enacted by the province of Ontario. Other reasons, such as giving confidence to U.S. partners that the borders will remain open, or providing operational efficiency, perhaps could have been dealt with differently.
The sweeping financial measures the Liberals enacted have rightly raised alarm. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland stated last week that people who simply donated to the convoy could have their accounts frozen. On CTV , Justice Minister David Lametti said: “if you are a member of a pro-Trump movement who is donating hundreds of thousands of dollars, and millions of dollars to this kind of thing, then you ought to be worried.”
Conservative MPs reported several people have had their accounts frozen for small donations, in one example for buying a convoy T-shirt. A government official told me Sunday that the intent of the measure is to catch individuals who are involved in an “active” role financing or organizing the convoy, but that law enforcement determines whose accounts get frozen.
It’s imperative the use of the Emergencies Act is followed with transparency and accountability. Though MPs get to debate and vote on the use of the act, and any measures involving national security is reviewed behind closed doors by elected officials, MPs would be wise to ensure that the inquiry mandated by the act is public. This will help ensure confidence in the process and hopefully serve as a deterrent to future governments.
It may also help de-escalate the rhetoric and ensure Canadians believe, as Kanata—Carleton Liberal MP Jenna Sudds stated in the House, that the response the blockades is non-partisan and focused on the safety and security of all.

Full text: Police gave a master class over the weekend in how to end a mass protest that had developed into an illegal occupation of downtown Ottawa.
Local police were supported by officers from many forces across Ontario and Quebec. They developed a comprehensive plan to end the occupation, and they executed it with minimum force.
They showed determination combined with patience. It took two full days and nights to move out the demonstrators, clear away the trucks and restore order to the streets of Ottawa. It was an impressive display of both force and restraint.
Now we're left to deal with the mess left behind - both the detritus on the streets of Ottawa and the political legacy of anger, distrust and open hatred on open display over the past month.
To begin with, the House of Commons was preparing on Monday to vote in favour of the Emergencies Act, with New Democrats joining Liberals in approving use of this extraordinary measure.
We were skeptical when the government invoked the act on Feb. 14. Border blockades were already being ended without use of the act, and the government did not make a convincing case that those disruptions and the Ottawa occupation amounted to a national emergency in the sense of the law.
In fact, the federal government was reaching for the sledgehammer of the Emergencies Act because of the abject failure of other levels of government.
The City of Ottawa and its local police force were helpless. And the government that should have stepped forward to make sure police had the resources they needed - the provincial government of Doug Ford - went AWOL. It acted as though Ottawa was in some other jurisdiction entirely, instead of being Ontario's second largest city.
So in came the feds, declaring a national emergency and finally giving police the political encouragement they obviously needed to take action.
It's still not clear whether the powers of the federal Emergencies Act were needed to clear the streets of Ottawa.
The government says it gave police the power to set up "secure areas," including much of central Ottawa and ban people from entering without good reason, thereby reducing the number of people joining the protesters.
And it says the act gave it the power to freeze bank accounts and credit cards of leaders of the protest, and to stop foreign funds from being directed to the so-called "Freedom Convoy."
Those are strong powers, and they should not be used lightly. It's possible to oppose the goals and conduct of the convoy protesters strongly, and still worry that reaching for the most extreme federal emergency power sets a worrisome precedent.
But that precedent has now been set, with Parliament's approval. It's less important to hash over what might have been than to make sure any risk of government overreach is minimized in the coming days.
In that regard it was encouraging on Monday to hear Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stating that the government does not intend to use the Emergencies Act a day longer than necessary.
The law is certainly nothing like the threat to civil liberties of the War Measures Act it replaced. But the whole point is that it gives the government extraordinary powers to deal with a real emergency, and to the extent that the emergency has been dealt with, the justification for special powers vanishes.
There's a good case to be made for giving government new powers to deal with occupation-style protests and blockades. In particular, the money behind such movements must be controlled.
It's now time for the government to make that case and seek approval from Parliament for such powers. They should not be rushed in under the cover of an emergency whose urgency is rapidly ebbing.

With Toronto's election season soon to start, an open race downtown draws a familiar name

Full text: With barely more than two months until the municipal election campaign begins, many questions still hang in the balance.
Will Mayor John Tory, coming up on eight years in the big chair, return as an incumbent candidate during an ongoing pandemic that has consumed much of his second term?
Will a progressive challenger try to upend his control over city council, after an unsuccessful run from last-minute entry and former city planner Jennifer Keesmaat in 2018?
And who will put their hand up to vie for a council chair after Premier Doug Ford upended the last election and cut the number of wards in half?
After the city lost its legal bid to overturn provincial legislation that altered the city’s election, Toronto will once again see a 25-mega-ward election that benefits longstanding councillors looking to keep a grip on their ward seats. Meanwhile health crises consume officials’ time and city finances, while debates about police spending, climate action and gun violence loom large over the next four years.
In at least one key ward, there will be a vacancy.
With Coun. Joe Cressy tapping out after two terms as a downtown councillor, the Star earlier reported , the Spadina-Fort York ward in the heart of the city is anyone’s to claim.
There is already one name being put forward.
Former Toronto District School Board trustee Ausma Malik ran a campaign of mutual support with Cressy in 2018 to represent what was then a split ward in the core before Ford intervened. She dropped off the ballot after the ward she planned to run in was eliminated.
Now, she’s ready to declare herself in for another round.
“The place where it begins for me always is my love of Toronto and most of all my love for the people who make up our communities, our neighbourhoods,” she said in an exclusive interview about her intentions to run.
She said she’s seen opportunity for positive change in neighbourhoods and also growing needs. She still firmly believes “progressive change” is needed on council. She said caring for her own mother during the pandemic has reminded her how “urgent and important” it is to build caring communities centred on housing, equality and safety.
“Who is elected, who is making decisions actually really does matter.”
Malik’s renewed bid for council also resumes the conversation about the diversity of a council that is largely white, largely made up of homeowners, and mostly male.
Malik, 37, the director of advocacy and organizing at the Atkinson Foundation, is a staunch progressive who has been unapologetic about her push for city-building.
(The foundation is a separate charity born from the legacy of former Toronto Star publisher Joseph Atkinson and has partnered with the Star on fellowships and journalism beats.)
As a trustee, Malik said she was most proud of seeing the groundbreaking of the first new downtown school in 20 years at CityPlace.
She said she’s passionate about speaking to the experiences that aren’t currently reflected on council.
“I feel strongly about finishing what I started in terms of being able to bring that experience to city hall,” and having constituents see themselves in their elected officials, said Malik, a woman of colour who wears hijab.
But she said coming to the decision to run “was not an easy one,” after she and other candidates experienced hate during the last campaign.
Hers could be an uphill battle if Tory successfully seeks a third term, with the influence of the left-leaning group of councillors appearing to wane at city hall.
“There’s still so much work to be done … to make our communities more affordable, to make sure people can stay and thrive in our city and to make our institutions more just and responsive,” she said. She added that she is committed to collaboration when asked about the possibility of working within a Tory administration.
It’s not yet clear if other wards will be up for grabs and the overall makeup of council open to shifting if other incumbent councillors step aside. Many have been publicly tight-lipped about their plans with Tory not yet declared. The mayor’s office has said he is focusing on the pandemic and recovery.
Nomination day, when anyone can sign up to run in the election, is May 2.
But nominations don’t close until August, after a June provincial election, giving politicians time to jump into the provincial ring and return to the municipal race if they are unsuccessful getting into Queen’s Park.
Election day in Toronto is Oct. 24.

Doug Ford's government blocked a modular housing project in Willowdale. The city says it's forging ahead despite the pushback

Full text: Toronto is forging ahead with plans to build supportive housing units for formerly homeless people on a Willowdale site, despite opposition from the Ontario government and local MPP Stan Cho.
But the province’s refusal to fast-track zoning for the modular housing will mean a needless extra winter out in bitter cold for Torontonians who deserve a warm, safe space, says Willowdale city councillor John Filion.
“What makes this site different? Politics, it would seem, and politics in the worst sense of the word,” Filion said outside city hall earlier this week, accompanied by local residents who support the supportive housing plans for 175 Cummer Avenue.
“Try explaining that kind of politics to 59 people who could have homes … on this cold day, whose future homes are stored in a TTC parking lot not far from the site where they will be assembled.”
Last spring the city asked Municipal Affairs Minister Steve Clark to issue a ministerial zoning order, or MZO, to allow quick construction of a three-storey building with 59 studio apartments for people on the streets or underhoused.
Clark accepted several other requests but denied one for Cummer, saying he was unsatisfied with community consultation on the project to be built on green space in front of Willowdale Manor, a Toronto Community Housing-operated seniors complex.
Cho, Willowdale’s PC MPP, urged denial of the MZO, saying many residents feel the site, north of Finch Avenue East and Willowdale Avenue, is unsuitable. He is vowing to help find a better location in the area.
“I’m receiving hundreds of calls and emails telling me the majority of my constituents support helping those suffering from homelessness, but they believe we can do better in our neighbourhood,” he said.
City officials, however, including Filion, Mayor John Tory and Coun. Ana Bailão, city council’s housing advocate, insist new homes for marginalized Torontonians will be built on Cummer, citing urgent need and strong community support.
At their urging, the planning and housing committee this week launched a rezoning process for the site, the slower, traditional alternative to fast-track MZOs, with appeal options that will likely see it argued at the Ontario Land Tribunal.
The housing components, meanwhile, sit covered in snow in a nearby TTC lot.
Tory, who went to war with Cho and his government in 2019 over deep cuts to public health funding, later rescinded, has otherwise stressed the need to work with Premier Doug Ford. He sounded exasperated when asked about Cummer.
Tory said he has told Ford and Cho directly that he has gone across the city allaying residents’ fears about housing with extra supports for formerly homeless Torontonians, and the Willowdale project is no different than the others.
“I’ve indicated our firm resolve to move it forward one way or another,” Tory said. “I have said I will meet with Mr. Cho but, in agreeing to meet him, I made it very clear that we were proceeding with this because we think it is the right thing to do for the city and that we’ve done it in a careful and thoughtful manner.”
Asked about Cho’s opposition, Filion, who has represented the area for three decades said that, with a June provincial election looming, “I think (Cho) has miscalculated that a very loud, angry group speaks for Willowdale and that there is more votes in opposing than in supporting it. I think that’s a huge miscalculation.”
Cho, first elected in 2018, rejects that, saying a majority of residents firmly oppose the building on that site for very good reasons. He cites distance to grocery stores, pharmacies and transit, saying he is looking at alternative sites he can’t yet disclose and is eager to work with city officials to build on the best spot.
Homeless people are going through “dark” times, he said, and “maybe they're going through an addictions issue or a mental health issue, maybe they don't have access to a car or their mobility is restricted, perhaps they are in a wheelchair — these are considerations my residents are talking about so if we have those (alternative) sites, if we can do better, then why aren't we trying to?”
Voices of Willowdale , a residents’ group formed to oppose supportive housing at that site, issued a statement criticizing the city for moving ahead with Cummer plans that would “steal these cherished parklands.”
In an email to the Star, group member Aldo Di Felice called the adjacent seniors’ building “a vulnerable community of mostly ethnic non English speaking elderly persons” concerned about the loss of their quiet community.
“The derogatory comments directed at community members and the continuing unwillingness of pubic officials to face hard facts which have been repeatedly tabled, is improper,” Di Felice wrote. “Weaponizing a clear cut seniors rights issue to fight a political battle with the province is highly irresponsible.”
James Brown, a 71-year-old Willowdale Manor resident who spoke in favour of the project with Filion, said his neighbours are being fed “misinformation.”
“There’s not one reason I can think of why this is not a good location,” Brown said, noting the site in front of his building is not a park, that he can walk to his choice of bus stops, and travelled from home to city hall in just over a half-hour.
“I cannot leave my building without tripping over a supermarket,” he said, adding that he could be homeless if he did not live in a rent-geared-to-income unit in the TCH seniors complex so his neighbours should welcome others in need.

Full text: Politics is often lampooned as "Hollywood, but for ugly people." That may true, given the propensity actors in both have for fame, scandal and an occasional outsized sense of self-importance, but there's a better comparison available.
Politics is sports, but for the unathletic. Politics has teams, fans and at its core, success is defined by winning or losing. That doesn't mean it should be treated like a game.
In sports, it's OK to oppose the other team simply for being the other team, because it is just a game. In politics, vilifying your opponents simply for being your opponents is a dangerous path to a place where ideological divisions impede progress and fracture society.
Caveats aside, professional sports holds lessons that political parties would do well to learn. Specifically, the Conservative Party of Canada should consider lessons on winning and losing as they search for a new party leader.
For the third consecutive election, the party leader during the campaign is out only a few months after their defeat. The Conservative Party of Canada will go through its third leadership campaign in five years. Such turnover in the sports world is never the sign of a franchise on the road to success.
In sports, there are teams that do well in the regular season, but never seem to win in the playoffs. Beyond our decades of disappointment, Maple Leafs fans bear the emotional scars of finishing near the top of the standings the last few seasons, only to prematurely exit the Stanley Cup playoffs with a first-round loss.
If you consider the leadership campaign the regular season and a general election the playoffs, the parallels for Conservatives start to become evident.
A successful leadership race should result in new memberships across the country, an increase in fundraising, ongoing attention from the media, and culminate in the election of a leader that caucus and the members are excited to follow into an election.
The party has checked those boxes during its last leadership campaigns. The party and the leader looked ready to compete in the playoffs of a federal election campaign.
Then they lost.
If the Conservative party wants to form government again, perhaps they should consider how they are building their team. Instead of choosing a leader who can get their base excited, shouldn't they be looking for someone who can get the country excited?
Highly skilled teams come to understand that the intensity of the playoffs needs a different skill set than the regular season.
A candidate must win a leadership campaign to be able to lead the party in an election, but if winning the leadership scuttles their chances with vast swaths of the electorate in a general election, was their leadership campaign really a success?
Andrew Scheer and Erin O'Toole both won leadership campaigns largely with the support of social conservatives, and maybe that is the only way remaining for any candidate to win the party's leadership. However, in a country where most voters are closer to the centre of the political spectrum, it wasn't hard to predict apprehension from the general electorate who do not share social conservative views.
Sports offers another lesson for Conservatives in the difference between coaches and players. A team that doesn't win, will eventually fire its coach - the theory being that you can't fire all the players. If a new person at the helm doesn't bring about a change in fortune, eventually, the team does effectively fire all the players and enter a rebuilding stage.
The Conservative team has had a different coach - Harper, Scheer, and O'Toole - for each of the last three elections, and lost all three. It might be time to consider looking at the players - the coalition of Conservative voters - and ask if winning again means this is the moment to rebuild their roster.

Council race draws a familiar name: Former TDSB trustee Ausma Malik has her sights set on Spadina-Fort York in October

Full text: With barely more than two months until the municipal election campaign begins, many questions still hang in the balance.
Will Mayor John Tory, coming up on eight years in the big chair, return as an incumbent candidate during an ongoing pandemic that has consumed much of his second term?
Will a progressive challenger try to upend his control over city council, after an unsuccessful run from last-minute entry and former city planner Jennifer Keesmaat in 2018?
And who will put their hand up to vie for a council chair after Premier Doug Ford upended the last election and cut the number of wards in half?
After the city lost its legal bid to overturn provincial legislation that altered the city's election, Toronto will once again see a 25-mega-ward election that benefits long-standing councillors looking to keep a grip on their ward seats. Meanwhile health crises consume officials' time and city finances, while debates about police spending, climate action and gun violence loom large over the next four years.
In at least one key ward, there will be a vacancy.
With Coun. Joe Cressy tapping out after two terms as a downtown councillor, the Star earlier reported, the Spadina-Fort York ward in the heart of the city is anyone's to claim.
There is already one name being put forward.
Former Toronto District School Board trustee Ausma Malik ran a campaign of mutual support with Cressy in 2018 to represent what was then a split ward in the core before Ford intervened. She dropped off the ballot after the ward she planned to run in was eliminated.
Now, she's ready to declare herself in for another round.
"The place where it begins for me always is my love of Toronto and most of all my love for the people who make up our communities, our neighbourhoods," she said in an exclusive interview about her intentions to run.
She said she's seen opportunity for positive change in neighbourhoods and also growing needs. She still firmly believes "progressive change" is needed on council. She said caring for her own mother during the pandemic has reminded her how "urgent and important" it is to build caring communities centred on housing, equality and safety.
"Who is elected, who is making decisions actually really does matter."
Malik's renewed bid for council also resumes the conversation about the diversity of a council that is largely white, largely made up of homeowners, and mostly male.
Malik, 37, the director of advocacy and organizing at the Atkinson Foundation, is a staunch progressive who has been unapologetic about her push for city-building.
(The foundation is a separate charity born from the legacy of former Toronto Star publisher Joseph Atkinson and has partnered with the Star on fellowships and journalism beats.)
As a trustee, Malik said she was most proud of seeing the groundbreaking of the first new downtown school in 20 years at CityPlace.
She said she's passionate about speaking to the experiences that aren't currently reflected on council.
"I feel strongly about finishing what I started in terms of being able to bring that experience to city hall," and having constituents see themselves in their elected officials, said Malik, a woman of colour who wears hijab.
But she said coming to the decision to run "was not an easy one," after she and other candidates experienced hate during the last campaign.
Hers could be an uphill battle if Tory successfully seeks a third term, with the influence of the left-leaning group of councillors appearing to wane at city hall.
"There's still so much work to be done ... to make our communities more affordable, to make sure people can stay and thrive in our city and to make our institutions more just and responsive," she said. She added that she is committed to collaboration when asked about the possibility of working within a Tory administration.
It's not yet clear if other wards will be up for grabs and the overall makeup of council open to shifting if other incumbent councillors step aside. Many have been publicly tight-lipped about their plans with Tory not yet declared. The mayor's office has said he is focusing on the pandemic and recovery.
Nomination day, when anyone can sign up to run in the election, is May 2.
But nominations don't close until August, after a June provincial election, giving politicians time to jump into the provincial ring and return to the municipal race if they are unsuccessful getting into Queen's Park.
Election day in Toronto is Oct. 24.

Emergencies Act takes Ottawa spotlight

Full text: It was a ghost town in Ottawa on Sunday as the cops cleared the last remaining vestiges of the so-called "Freedom Convoy's" occupation as a soft dusting of snow seemed to poetically want to cool all the heated rhetoric of the past three weeks.
Inside the House of Commons, however, where debate continued on the government's use of the Emergencies Act, MPs ratcheted up the temperature.
"I confess I do have trouble seeing how parked trucks, bouncy castles, a big daily barbecue and ball hockey, Canadian flags and singing, and donations for the homeless in front of Parliament meet these (emergency) criteria," said Lakeland, Alta., MP Shannon Stubbs, one of several Conservative members to downplay the seriousness of the blockades.
"It was like a Canada Day times a thousand. Bigger than any Canada Day that I have ever seen in this country," said Lianne Rood, Ontario MP for Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, who dismissed the blockade's extremist elements and described the occupation as joyful.
"There is no al-Qaida. There is no Taliban. There are no North Korean special forces looking to take over the government," said Michael Kram, MP for Regina-Wascana. "This is a matter for local law enforcement officials and it is wrong for the government to try to make it out to be anything more than that."
The Ottawa Police Service, of course, said early on it was unable to bring an end to the protest and requested political assistance.
Its interim police chief, Steve Bell, said the measures enacted under the Emergencies Act were key to bringing about an end to the protest.
Ed Fast, MP for Abbotsford, B.C., described the blockades as "peaceful, civil disobedience." He accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of doing "what his father had done in 1970" of triggering "Canada's war measures regime."
While Fast is right that the circumstances in 2022 are different than those of 1970, where the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) bombed mailboxes, kidnapped two officials, and murdered the deputy premier, the Emergencies Act is nowhere near as sweeping as the War Measures Act.
There are no soldiers in the street and the measures must be charter compliant and reviewed by elected officials.
The debate, which should have been a sombre event, was hard to hear at times as Conservatives engaged in small talk rather than listen to the speakers. It degenerated with MPs calling each other names. Michael Cooper, Conservative MP for St. Albert-Edmonton, said Liberal MP for Kingston and the Islands Mark Gerretsen was "a despicable human being." Winnipeg Centre NDP MP Leah Gazan said someone told her: "Why don't you f--- off."
Despite lots of what Green Party parliamentary leader Elizabeth May called "toxic" air, valid points were raised during the debate.
The use of the Emergencies Act is unprecedented and should not be normalized. It should not be used or be seen to be used to squash dissent.
I heard no MP, however, suggest realistic measures the prime minister could have taken to resolve the blockades. Faced with a similar situation - for example, environmentalists parking hundreds of electric vehicles and building log cabins in the streets of Ottawa - I'm not convinced a Conservative government would have acted differently.
Experts have noted that several of the reasons stated by the government for why the act was necessary - from designating a security perimeter, to outlawing access to minors, to forcing tow-truck companies to help the police - could have been enacted by the province of Ontario. Other reasons, such as giving confidence to U.S. partners that the borders will remain open, or providing operational efficiency, perhaps could have been dealt with differently.
The sweeping financial measures the Liberals enacted have rightly raised alarm. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland stated last week that people who simply donated to the convoy could have their accounts frozen. On CTV, Justice Minister David Lametti said: "if you are a member of a pro-Trump movement who is donating hundreds of thousands of dollars, and millions of dollars to this kind of thing, then you ought to be worried."
Conservative MPs reported several people have had their accounts frozen for small donations, in one example for buying a convoy T-shirt. A government official told me Sunday that the intent of the measure is to catch individuals who are involved in an "active" role financing or organizing the convoy, but that law enforcement determines whose accounts get frozen.
It's imperative the use of the Emergencies Act is followed with transparency and accountability. Though MPs get to debate and vote on the use of the act, and any measures involving national security is reviewed behind closed doors by elected officials, MPs would be wise to ensure that the inquiry mandated by the act is public. This will help ensure confidence in the process and hopefully serve as a deterrent to future governments.
It may also help de-escalate the rhetoric and ensure Canadians believe, as Kanata-Carleton Liberal MP Jenna Sudds stated in the House, that the response to the blockades is non-partisan and focused on the safety and security of all.

'This occupation is over': Officers sweep through downtown Ottawa, moving out trucks, tents and other equipment

Full text: Police aggressively retook large areas of downtown Ottawa Saturday clearing hundreds of protesters, towing trucks and dismantling encampments in an operation the city's police chief said remains far from over.
But as the so-called Freedom Convoy marked its third full week in the nation's capital, the line its organizers have been urging supporters to hold was replaced by police fencing, officers in tactical gear wielding batons and with high-profile protest mobilizers in police custody awaiting bail.
Interim Ottawa police Chief Steve Bell said Saturday there have now been 170 arrests in total, and police have made "very important progress."
"This occupation is now over. We will continue with our mission until it is complete," he said during an afternoon briefing.
Emotions had been running high on the frigid streets of the nation's capital earlier Saturday as the slow and methodical pace of police, that characterized much of the operations Friday, evaporated after numerous warnings from Ottawa police that things were going to change.
"Protesters: We told you to leave. We gave you time to leave. We were slow and methodical, yet you were assaultive and aggressive with officers and the horses. Based on your behaviour, we are responding by including helmets and batons for our safety," the force posted on social media.
Officers swept through the downtown core, moving from east to west as they pushed back protesters, and then once an area was clear, began moving out trucks, tents and other physical elements of the protest.
Police said 46 vehicles had been removed from the secure zone since Friday, with 53 total vehicles towed and 22 licence plates seized.
"It is, to this point, going exactly as we had anticipated," Bell said.
Despite it now being illegal for children to be in a secure zone downtown, some were spotted playing in snowbanks just around the corner from where police had earlier used what they called "chemical irritants" to disperse elements of the crowd massing at the foot of the Parliament buildings.
During the briefing, Bell declined to specify which other tactics were being used by police.
Police did say that smoke seen was caused by protesters, not officers.
A social media account associated with the "Freedom Convoy" had posted a message around noon Saturday that they ordered truckers to move to avoid further confrontation with police.
That message was repeated but with a caveat by one organizer, Tom Marazzo, during an emotional press conference.
"We are not going to behave like the government and tell you what to do," he said, urging attendees to "dig deep" and decide what's best for them.
None of the demonstrators the Star spoke with were aware of Marazzo's call to disperse but by early afternoon, as lines of police continued to move, the tension between the two sides began to ease.
Key mobilization points for the demonstrators were secured by police, including the National War Monument, and a sound stage across from the Peace Tower that had been the sight of a nightly dance party was torn down.
But by nightfall, the party had re-established itself just a few blocks away, as crowds danced to a DJ and shot off fireworks, with police initially just looking on.
Early Saturday evening, police posted on social media that officers were being assaulted, which led to the use of "mid range impact weapons (ARWEN) to stop the violent actions of the protesters."
ARWEN are often weapons that shoot rubber bullets.
Police said they made 47 arrests on Saturday, but Bell could not say how many of those arrested are facing charges.
Some have begun appearing in court. At least one refused to identify himself during proceedings, saying his arrest was political and he did not acknowledge it, while others refused to agree to bail or release conditions.
One key protest organizer, Tamara Lich, also appeared in court, where the Crown said they intend to hold her accountable for every day that demonstrators tried to "hold the line" against police - a phrase that's become the rallying cry for her and other leaders.
Lich told the court she is willing to leave the city and return to her home in Medicine Hat, Alta., and have no further contact with members of the protest if she is released.
She told the court her accounts have been frozen, and she'd be unable to fly home because she does not have proof of vaccination, though her lawyer later told the court arrangements have been made for her and her husband, Dwayne, to get a lift.
The Crown argued she should not be released, alleging that she's shown no respect for the rule of law and would disregard any terms, while counsel for Lich said she should not be held accountable for everyone who has shown up in Ottawa.
The judge reserved her decision on bail until Tuesday morning. Another organizer, Pat King, is now also scheduled to have a bail hearing Tuesday.
Bell told reporters police investigations into those believed to have played a role in the demonstrations will continue long after the streets are cleared.
"This investigation will go on for months to come."
The Parliament buildings themselves - where inside MPs were debating the declaration of a public order emergency that's given police the powers for their ongoing operation - were also placed under high alert for a time Saturday, with MPs told not to leave the building.
"We are all on pins and needles," Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino said during a briefing with reporters addressing the ongoing operation and the use of the Emergencies Act.
The Liberal government had invoked the act on Monday, calling the protests in Ottawa and at some of the country's border points a threat beyond the existing capacity of police and other officials to mitigate.
The movement began as a call to end vaccine mandates for truckers, but as the trucks have rolled across the country grievances have piled into the mix, including anti-government sentiment, extremist and racist ideology and many who are just fed up and frustrated with COVID-19 pandemic regulations as a whole.
The Conservatives and Bloc Québécois have called the use of the act and related measures unnecessary, saying existing police powers should have been enough in Ottawa, as they were sufficient to clear related border blockades in other provinces.
The New Democrats, however, are currently siding with the Liberal government. If the NDP does support the declaration, the vote will pass.
Bell has credited the regulations and orders made under the act for giving his force - which had been under intense criticism for not appearing to be acting at all over the last three weeks - the ability to move in and execute the current plan.
Among the powers also deployed was increased scrutiny of the financial support demonstrators have received. Mendicino said 76 bank accounts representing $3.2 million attributable to the illegal blockades have been frozen.
The government has stressed the powers are time-limited, and being used in compliance with the charter. As the streets of Ottawa began to clear, Mendicino was pressed on what it would take to end the use of the laws.
He said he is in contact with the RCMP and other law enforcement officials for their assessment.
"Yes, there has been progress, but the situation remains dynamic, it remains fluid and we'll wait to see how things unfold in the coming hours and days," he said.
As in previous weeks, some protests in solidarity with the Ottawa demonstrators unfolded in other parts of the country.
In British Columbia, the Canada Border Services Agency announced the busiest Canada-U.S. border crossing used by the province's truckers was experiencing a service disruption due to protest activity in the area.
In Quebec, thousands of protesters converged on the provincial legislature to take part in a rally inspired by the "Freedom Convoy" protest. Horns could be heard as a convoy of vans and cars circled near the legislature.
Protesters in Fredericton, N.B., also staged another anti-mandate rally, with police saying the crowd reached about 100 people at its peak.

Full text: The federal government has no plans to immediately revoke its declaration of a national emergency if police completely clear the occupation of downtown Ottawa this weekend by so-called “Freedom Convoy” protesters.
But that decision now rests ultimately not in the hands of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, but rather with NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh.
Trudeau’s minority government needs the support of at least one of the major opposition parties in a vote next week to endorse its invocation of the Emergencies Act, which gives the government extraordinary and time-limited powers.
The Conservatives and Bloc Québécois have both said they will vote against the government, leaving the NDP as the Liberal minority’s only potential partner. So far, Singh has indicated that his party will support the government action, but that could change as the events of the weekend unfold.
An NDP official speaking on background Friday said the party’s stance remained unchanged, but said New Democrats would be monitoring the situation in Ottawa this weekend and “have stressed that we will be vigilant and pull our support as needed.”
Amid a flurry of criticism and claims that the government had overreacted Monday by invoking the act for the first time in history, and had failed to meet the definition of a “national emergency,” Justice Minister David Lametti said that the occupation and border blockades “have been national in scope.”
He said the government hopes to lift the declaration “as soon as possible,” but pointed to the ongoing situation in Ottawa and the need for vigilance at border crossings and around other critical infrastructure.
“We’ll lift the state of emergency when we can, and as soon as possible, once the situation is secure and we’re sure that we no longer need the tools identified in the Emergencies Act,” Lametti said.
While all major ports of entry remain open for trade and travel, Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino warned that “the progress we have made at the borders is not cast in stone.”
He said protesters have attempted to obstruct crossings again, including at the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor, but so far have been prevented from doing so by police.
“I would simply stress that while we’ve made progress, the blockades are not ended there,” he said. “There is an ongoing and fluid situation and the tools being used under the Emergencies Act have been of great assistance.”
Although the Emergencies Act has been in effect since the government invoked it on Monday, both the House of Commons and Senate need to vote on motions to confirm its activation. If the motion fails in either chamber, the declaration of emergency is immediately revoked.
Both the House and the Senate cancelled their sessions on Friday over security concerns as police began to clear protesters from downtown Ottawa. Debate on the motion was expected to resume Saturday morning in the House, while the Senate is set to meet Monday.
Interim Conservative Leader Candice Bergen tweeted Friday that Trudeau was to blame for the situation in Ottawa, and said that MPs need to return to the House on Saturday “to stop the overreach by this government.”
But the cabinet ministers insisted that tools granted by the Emergencies Act have been of use to law enforcement this week. The act allows, among other things, for the government to direct “qualified individuals” to provide essential services for compensation.
Lametti said this has included tow-truck drivers feeling “covered by the law,” making them willing to help police clear vehicles that had converged on downtown Ottawa. It’s had “a very positive impact, it’s incentivized people across Canada,” he said.
The ability under the act to designate “no-go zones” has also allowed police to more effectively clear protesters, Mendicino said.
Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland again noted that the act has allowed for the freezing of bank accounts related to the protests. But she also again declined to provide any details, citing requests from police, although she said she recognized the information “is in the public interest” and hopes to eventually share it.
That said, a lawyer for Ottawa residents who have launched a class-action lawsuit for damages allegedly caused by the protests said the government has been moving too slowly in freezing accounts.
As the Star’s Tonda MacCharles reported Thursday , the private citizens were also successful in getting a court order to freeze convoy organizers’ bank accounts and digital “wallets,” which are believed to hold more than $1 million in bitcoin and cryptocurrency.

City moves ahead with contentious modular housing

Full text: Toronto is forging ahead with plans to build supportive housing units for formerly homeless people on a Willowdale site, despite opposition from the Ontario government and local MPP Stan Cho.
But the province's refusal to fast-track zoning for the modular housing will mean a needless extra winter out in bitter cold for Torontonians who deserve a warm, safe space, says Willowdale Coun. John Filion.
"What makes this site different? Politics, it would seem, and politics in the worst sense of the word," Filion said outside city hall last week, accompanied by local residents who support the supportive housing plans for 175 Cummer Ave.
"Try explaining that kind of politics to 59 people who could have homes ... on this cold day, whose future homes are stored in a TTC parking lot not far from the site where they will be assembled."
Last spring, the city asked Municipal Affairs Minister Steve Clark to issue a ministerial zoning order, or MZO, to allow quick construction of a three-storey building with 59 studio apartments for people on the streets or underhoused.
Clark accepted several other requests but denied the one for Cummer, saying he was unsatisfied with community consultation on the project to be built on green space in front of Willowdale Manor, a Toronto Community Housing-operated seniors complex.
Cho, Willowdale's PC MPP, urged denial of the MZO, saying many residents feel the site, north of Finch Avenue East and Willowdale Avenue, is unsuitable. He is vowing to help find a better location in the area.
"I'm receiving hundreds of calls and emails telling me the majority of my constituents support helping those suffering from homelessness, but they believe we can do better in our neighbourhood," he said.
But city officials, including Filion, Mayor John Tory and Coun. Ana Bailão, council's housing advocate, insist new homes for marginalized Torontonians will be built on Cummer, citing urgent need and strong community support.
At their urging, the planning and housing committee last week launched a rezoning process for the site, the slower, traditional alternative to fast-track MZOs, with appeal options that will likely see it argued at the Ontario Land Tribunal.
The housing components, meanwhile, sit covered in snow at a nearby TTC lot.
Tory, who went to war with Cho and his government in 2019 over deep cuts to public health funding, later rescinded, has otherwise stressed the need to work with Premier Doug Ford. He sounded exasperated when asked about Cummer.
Tory said he has told Ford and Cho directly that he has gone across the city allaying residents' fears about housing with extra supports for formerly homeless Torontonians, and the Willowdale project is no different than the others.
"I've indicated our firm resolve to move it forward one way or another," Tory said. "I have said I will meet with Mr. Cho but, in agreeing to meet him, I made it very clear that we were proceeding with this because we think it is the right thing to do for the city and that we've done it in a careful and thoughtful manner."
Asked about Cho's opposition, Filion, who has represented the area for three decades, said that with a June provincial election looming, "I think (Cho) has miscalculated that a very loud, angry group speaks for Willowdale and that there is more votes in opposing than in supporting it. I think that's a huge miscalculation."
Cho, first elected in 2018, rejects that, saying a majority of residents firmly oppose the building on that site for very good reasons. He cites distance to grocery stores, pharmacies and transit, saying he is looking at alternative sites he can't yet disclose and is eager to work with city officials to build on the best spot.
Homeless people are going through "dark" times, he said, and "maybe they're going through an addictions issue or a mental health issue, maybe they don't have access to a car or their mobility is restricted, perhaps they are in a wheelchair. These are considerations my residents are talking about, so if we have those (alternative) sites, if we can do better, then why aren't we trying to?"
Voices of Willowdale, a residents' group formed to oppose supportive housing at that site, issued a statement criticizing the city for moving ahead with Cummer plans that would "steal these cherished parklands."
In an email to the Star, group member Aldo Di Felice called the adjacent seniors' building "a vulnerable community of mostly ethnic, non-English-speaking elderly persons" concerned about the loss of their quiet community.
"The derogatory comments directed at community members and the continuing unwillingness of public officials to face hard facts, which have been repeatedly tabled, is improper," Di Felice wrote. "Weaponizing a clear-cut seniors' rights issue to fight a political battle with the province is highly irresponsible."
James Brown, a 71-year-old Willowdale Manor resident who spoke in favour of the project with Filion, said his neighbours are being fed "misinformation."
"There's not one reason I can think of why this is not a good location," Brown said, noting the site in front of his building is not a park, that he can walk to his choice of bus stops, and travelled from home to city hall in just over a half-hour.
"I cannot leave my building without tripping over a supermarket," he said, adding that he could be homeless if he did not live in a rent-geared-to-income unit in the TCH seniors complex, so his neighbours should welcome others in need.

Doug Ford says Ontario's top doc will decide when mask mandate ends

Full text: It will be up to Ontario’s chief medical officer of health to determine when it is safe to lift the province’s pandemic mask mandate, says Premier Doug Ford.
In the wake of Dr. Kieran Moore’s announcement that the mandatory indoor mask policy will be reviewed in March , Ford stressed he would defer to “health and science.”
Speaking to reporters Friday at a campaign-style event in Whitby, the premier said he must “wait for the recommendations” from his top public health adviser.
“He’s sent recommendations in as we’re winding down and I’m going to follow his advice,” said Ford.
“We have a great plan. We’re going to follow that plan. We’re going to do it cautiously and move forward cautiously,” he said, claiming he has “been accused of being the most cautious leader in North America when it comes to this pandemic.”
That’s apparently a reference to the fact Ontario has faced longer COVID-19 lockdowns that any other province or U.S. state and its students have missed more in-person classes than anywhere on the continent.
But the province has fared better in terms of deaths per capita than any of its neighbours.
Ontario, with a population of 14.8 million, has lost 12,204 people to COVID-19. Quebec, home to 8.5 million, has suffered 13,812 deaths. Similarly, Manitoba, with 1.4 million people, has had 1,647 COVID-19 victims.
South of the border, New York, with 20.2 million people, has had 66,224 deaths while Michigan, with a population of 10 million, has lost 33,832 people.
“I’m going to continue being cautious, but we also have to move forward. We have to get back to normal. We have to get our lives back to normal as well,” said Ford.
On Thursday, Moore said “the worst is behind us, but there is an ongoing risk,” so masks will be required for a while longer.
“We’ll be reviewing masking in public on the second or third week of March and make decisions for all public spaces, including schools in that time frame,” the top doctor said.
“If and when we transition, it would be from … a mandate to mask to a recommendation to mask. I would certainly hope that vulnerable members of our community that are at risk for this virus, that are immune suppressed or transplant patients in public spaces would continue to mask,” he said.
“And we may review masking for public spaces like in transport systems like subways and buses, etc., to ensure that everyone’s confident to use those resources.”
Masks that cover the mouth and nose have been mandatory in nearly all indoor settings — outside private homes — in most of Ontario since July 2020, four months after COVID-19 hit.
They must be worn in workplaces and public spaces such as shops, hotel lobbies, indoor stadiums, theatres, public transit, taxis and when walking around bars restaurants and bars.

Full text: OTTAWA — Police aggressively retook large areas of downtown Ottawa Saturday clearing hundreds of protesters, towing trucks and dismantling encampments in an operation the city’s police chief said remains far from over.
But as the so-called Freedom Convoy marked its third full week in the nation’s capital, the line its organizers have been urging supporters to hold was replaced by police fencing, officers in tactical gear wielding batons and with high-profile protest mobilizers in police custody awaiting bail.
Interim Ottawa police chief Steve Bell said Saturday there have now been 170 arrests in total, and police have made “very important progress.”
“This occupation is now over. We will continue with our mission until it is complete,” he said during an afternoon briefing.
Emotions had been running high on the frigid streets of the nation’s capital earlier Saturday as the slow and methodical pace of police that characterized much of the operations Friday evaporated after numerous warnings from Ottawa police that things were going to change.
“Protesters: We told you to leave. We gave you time to leave. We were slow and methodical, yet you were assaultive and aggressive with officers and the horses. Based on your behaviour, we are responding by including helmets and batons for our safety,” the force posted on social media.
One woman told the Star she’d arrived in Ottawa just a day earlier to join the crowd, but now wanted to leave — except she could not convince her sister to join her.
Officers swept through the downtown core, moving from east to west as they pushed back protesters, and then once an area was clear, began moving out trucks, tents and other physical elements of the protest.
Police said 46 vehicles had been removed from the secure zone since Friday, with 53 total vehicles towed and 22 licence plates seized.
“It is to this point going exactly as we had anticipated,” Bell said.
Despite it now being illegal for children to be in a secure zone downtown, some were spotted playing in snowbanks just around the corner from where police had earlier used what they called “chemical irritants” to disperse elements of the crowd massing at the foot of the Parliament buildings.
During the briefing, Bell declined to specify which other tactics were being used by police.
Police did say that smoke seen was caused by protesters, not officers.
A social media account associated with the Freedom Convoy had posted a message around noon Saturday that they ordered truckers to move to avoid further confrontation with police.
That message was repeated but with a caveat by one organizer, Tom Marazzo during an emotional press conference.
“We are not going to behave like the government and tell you what to do,” he said, urging attendees to “dig deep” and decide what’s best for them.
None of the demonstrators the Star spoke with were aware of Marazzo’s call to disperse but by early afternoon, as lines of police continued to move, the tension between the two sides began to ease.
Key mobilization points for the demonstrators were secured by police, including the National War Monument, and a sound stage across from the Peace Tower that had been the sight of a nightly dance party was torn down.
But by nightfall, the party had re-established itself just a few blocks away, as crowds danced to a DJ and shot off fireworks, with police initially just looking on.
Early Saturday evening, police posted on social media that officers were being assaulted, which led to the use of “mid range impact weapons (ARWEN) to stop the violent actions of the protesters.
ARWEN are often weapons which shoot rubber bullets.
Police said they made 47 arrests on Saturday, but Bell could not say how many of those arrested in total are facing charges.
Some have begun appearing in court. At least one refused to identify himself during proceedings Saturday, saying his arrest was political and he did not acknowledge it, while others refused to agree to bail or release conditions.
One key protest organizer, Tamara Lich, also appeared in court, where the Crown said they intend to hold her accountable for every day that demonstrators trying to “hold the line” against police — a phrase that’s become the rallying cry for her and other leaders.
Lich told the court she is willing to leave the city and return to her home in Medicine Hat, Alta., and have no further contact with members of the protest if she is released.
She told the court her accounts have been frozen, and she’d be unable to fly home because she does not have proof of vaccination, though her lawyer later told the court arrangements have been made for her and her husband Dwayne to get a lift.
The Crown has argued she should not be released, alleging that she’s shown no respect for the rule of law and would disregard any terms, while counsel for Lich said she should not be held accountable for everyone who has shown up in Ottawa.
The judge reserved her decision on bail until Tuesday morning. Another organizer, Pat King, is now also scheduled to have a bail hearing Tuesday.
Bell told reporters Saturday that police investigations into those believed to have played a role in the demonstrations will continue long after the streets are cleared.
“This investigation will go on for months to come.”
The Parliament buildings themselves — where inside MPs were debating the declaration of a public order emergency that’s given police the powers for their ongoing operation — were also placed under high alert for a time Saturday, with MPs told not to leave the building.
“We are all on pins and needles,” Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino said Saturday during a briefing with reporters addressing the ongoing operation and the use of the Emergencies Act.
The Liberal government had invoked the act on Monday, calling the protests in Ottawa and at some of the country’s border points a threat beyond the existing capacity of police and other officials to mitigate.
The movement began as a call to end vaccine mandates for truckers, but as the trucks have rolled across the country grievances have piled into the mix, including anti-government sentiment, extremist and racist ideology and many who are just fed up and frustrated with COVID-19 pandemic regulations as a whole.
The Conservatives and Bloc Québécois have called the use of the act and related measures unnecessary, saying existing police powers should have been enough in Ottawa, as they were sufficient to clear related border blockades in other provinces.
The New Democrats, however, are currently siding with the Liberal government, meaning the vote will pass.
Bell has credited the regulations and orders made under the act for giving his force — which had been under intense criticism for not appearing to be acting at all over the last three weeks — the ability to move in and execute the current plan.
Among the powers also deployed was increased scrutiny of the financial support demonstrators have received. Mendicino said 76 bank accounts representing $3.2 million attributable to the illegal blockades have been frozen.
The government has stressed the powers are time-limited, and being used in compliance with the charter.
As the streets of Ottawa began to clear, Mendicino was pressed Saturday on what it would take to end the use of the laws.
He said he is in contact with the RCMP and other law enforcement officials for their assessment.
“Yes, there has been progress, but the situation remains dynamic, it remains fluid and we'll wait to see how things unfold in the coming hours and days,” he said.

Full text: Ontario will remove tolls on two Greater Toronto Area highways this spring in a move Premier Doug Ford says will help Ontarians financially after the hardships of the pandemic.
Ford announced the changes to Highways 412 and 418 on Friday. The changes to the north-south Durham Region routes are to take effect on April 5.
Removing the tolls will give residents more travel options, relieve gridlock and help local businesses, the province said.
"Getting rid of these tolls will bring real tangible relief to the people of Durham and surrounding regions," Ford said at a news conference in Whitby, Ont.
"We know that this pandemic has been tough enough on people and businesses. Removing these tolls, putting money back in the pockets of hardworking Ontarians, is the right thing to do."
Ford also used his campaign-style announcement, which comes ahead of the scheduled June 2 provincial election, to take shots at the previous Liberal government for not ending what he called the "costly and unfair" tolls.
The routes connect Highway 401 to Highway 407 in Durham Region.
The government said its announcement won't affect rates on the separate, privately owned 407 ETR highway.
A Ministry of Transportation report from last year said tolling operations on Highways 407, 412 and 418 generated $160 million in total between 2017 and 2020.
Revenue from Highways 412 and 418 made up 24 per cent of the total, at $38.2 million.
The report estimated that it would take more than 25 years to pay construction costs on the two highways.
"This would be substantially longer if tolls were removed from Highways 412 and 418," it said.
A spokeswoman for the transportation minister did not comment specifically on the revenue and cost impacts of removing the tolls.
"The Ministry of Transportation will be responsible for the cost of the maintenance of the highways," Dakota Brasier said in an emailed statement.
"We will continue to explore revenue-generating opportunities along the transportation network that will not be a cost burden to Ontarians."
The NDP provincial member for Oshawa criticized the former Liberal government and current Progressive Conservative government for not ending the tolls sooner, calling the move "a big victory that's long overdue."
"The people of Durham and I have been the driving force behind ending these tolls. Today is a victory for the people of Durham Region," Jennifer French said in a written statement.

It didn’t need to be like this. If Doug Ford wasn’t walking behind his ego, stumbling through the early and mid stages of this pandemic, falling down to the bunker as the home stretch neared, and then declaring a state of emergency in what was no less than an election speech, we would not have arrived at this sad state of affairs.
Now that he has been asked to focus on resolving the current convoy occupation of Ontario and put campaigning to the rear, we’ll see what transpires.

Full text: With an Ontario election less than four months away, Premier Doug Ford is removing tolls from Highway 412 in Whitby and Highway 418 in Clarington.
But Ford's campaign-style pledge does not apply to Highway 407, which was sold to a private consortium by Progressive Conservative premier Mike Harris before the 1999 election, or the newer publicly owned section of that tollway into Durham Region.
"You can hop on that highway and you can drive for free," Ford told reporters Friday in Whitby, noting toll charges will be lifted as of April 5.
That's one month before the official start of the June 2 election campaign.
The two highways, which connect Highway 401 and Highway 407, are the only provincially owned north-south toll roads in Ontario.
Tolls are about 30 cents a kilometre for motorists and 80 cents for commercial transports.
The highways were built by the previous Liberal government, in which current leader Steven Del Duca was transportation minister. Highway 412 opened in 2016 and Highway 418 opened in 2019.
"I just want to remind you the person that put in these tolls was Steven Del Duca. He was the architect of this. He said ... he will never get rid of tolls. Well, we don't believe that," said Ford, who has been criticized for leaving the fees in place since his government was elected in 2018.
"We have heard the people of Durham loud and clear and we agree that the tolls imposed on Highways 412 and 418 by the previous government are wrong and unfair."
Durham residents have long complained that the public highways were subject to tolls, unlike most others in Ontario.
That led to increased congestion on adjacent streets as commuters tried to avoid the charges.
Councils in Whitby, Ajax and Durham Region have all passed motions imploring the province to remove the levies.
Ron Stevens, a Durham resident who has been pushing for the changes for years, said it was "welcome news and long overdue" for the community.
"It is unfortunate that Premier Ford blames the previous government for something his transportation minister (Caroline Mulroney) defended and said was justified to build these roads," said Stevens, who also blasted local Tory MPP Lorne Coe for not moving sooner.
"This community has been treated very unfairly and they have now acknowledged that for the first time, obviously due to an election coming soon."
A provincial report last April found the little-used highways were projected to generate $580 million in revenue for the treasury over the next three decades.
In 2019, Highway 412 had 12,200 daily drivers while Highway 418 had 3,100 drivers.
That compares with the 400,000 drivers who use Highway 400 each day between Highways 401 and 407.
New Democratic MPP Jennifer French (Oshawa), who has advocated for the removal of the tolls, hailed the announcement as "a big victory that's long overdue."
"That was a terrible move from Steven Del Duca and the Liberals," French said, stressing the Tories share blame.
"Doug Ford could and should have removed the tolls of on Highways 412 and 418 years ago. Instead, his government let my 2018 (private member's) bill to end the tolls languish at committee," she said.
"That means drivers shelled out extra cash for an extra four years just because Doug Ford wanted to wait until just before an election to do what was right all along."
Pressure had mounted on Ford to cancel the charges after he promised the proposed Highway 413 and Bradford Bypass would not be tolled.

Full text: Ford is putting his re-election ahead of Ontario's health
Ford's feelings trump facts, Feb. 19
Why is it everything that Premier Doug Ford says about this pandemic is the opposite of what doctors and scientists are saying?
Because he is just trying to get re-elected, and has no care for the health and well-being of Ontarians.
He announced "the world is done with COVID."
I can't think of anything stupider.
Many countries are currently ravaged with COVID-19, and, in case you were not aware, the world won't be "done with COVID," until most of it is vaccinated.
Ontario schools closed and 46 daily deaths is the data to announce the end of COVID-19. Everyone wants "normal," but that will never happen without restrictions, passports, vaccines and masks.
Philip Cole, Strathroy, Ont.
Bridges simply
had to be reopened,
no matter what
Ford's feelings trump facts, Feb. 19
I don't care for Ford nor for the dithering by all three levels of government in recent weeks, but the things coming across the border aren't "widgets."
Those blockaded trucks are bringing food, medicines, replacement parts for cars and appliances, building supplies and myriad other things that stock our stores and enable as to continue living reasonably pleasant lives.
That's what made action more urgent with respect to bridges.
Anita Dermer,Toronto
Ego, electioneering block effective action on pandemic
What a failure of leadership!,
Feb. 11
It didn't need to be like this. If Doug Ford wasn't walking behind his ego, stumbling through the early and mid stages of this pandemic, falling down to the bunker as the home stretch neared, and then declaring a state of emergency in what was no less than an election speech, we would not have arrived at this sad state of affairs.

Ernie Ilson, Mississauga
Do the right thing or get elected?
Why not do both?
What a failure of leadership!,
Feb. 11
Unfortunately, for the people of Ontario, there is a provincial election coming up. For all of us, this means having a premier who can't decide between doing the right thing immediately, or trying to remain popular to some of the electorate by hiding and doing nothing, hoping the problem will solve itself.
June will come soon enough.

Full text: As police move to end the Parliament Hill blockade, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has emerged as the pivotal player in the political drama surrounding the use of the Emergencies Act in the House of Commons.
That may partly be the result of a miscalculation on the part of Justin Trudeau's government.
Going into the debate over the use of the act, the assumption in many Liberal circles was that the Conservative official opposition or at least a significant number of its members would - as long-standing self-proclaimed law-and-order champions - have little choice but to support the move.
There was also the fact that Ontario Premier Doug Ford, the Conservatives' leading provincial figure, was on board with Trudeau's decision.
Instead, the federal Conservative party has doubled down on its conviction that invoking the act has more to do with repairing Trudeau's image at all costs than with resolving the blockades.
As a result, only the NDP stands between the prime minister, who made history by becoming the first to invoke the Emergencies Act, and a defeat of the parliamentary motion required to back the government's decision.
The Commons vote on that motion is scheduled for Monday or Tuesday. Between now and then, much could still tilt the balance against it. That starts with a resolution - over the weekend - of the occupation that has transformed downtown Ottawa into a mob-ruled sector.
So far, the border blockades that had endangered the free flow of goods between Canada and the United States have all been resolved.
In Ontario, the Ambassador Bridge between Windsor and Detroit was cleared before the prime minister invoked the Emergencies Act. There, as in Manitoba, Alberta and British Columbia, the evidence is so far that the police's existing powers are up to the job of restoring order and keeping traffic flowing.
Over the past few days on Parliament Hill, police forces have for the first time started to really exercise those same powers. In case those were not enough, they have been supplemented by Ontario's decision to put in play its own emergency powers.
Against those developments, Trudeau has spent the past week making his case for invoking the Emergencies Act. The jury is still out on the issue. As the blockades come down, the need for the extraordinary measures the act allows becomes harder to demonstrate.
The NDP support of the Emergencies Act was always conditional. At every step of the way, Singh has insisted he could revisit his stance in the face of changing circumstances.
Before next week's vote, he may have to decide whether the circumstances have changed enough to make the measure obsolete.
Absent the NDP's continued support, Trudeau would have to either abandon the use of the Emergencies Act or else face a losing vote that could easily be read as one of non-confidence in his minority government. The former would probably emerge as the preferred alternative.
There are financial measures in the decree that attends the Emergencies Act that would merit being articulated in a proper piece of legislation.
For instance, the events of the past few weeks suggest that Canada is ill-equipped to counter attempts to channel foreign funds into movements dedicated to destabilizing its institutions and/or its infrastructures.
But those issues require legislative solutions that extend beyond the 30-day period covered by the Emergencies Act. Those would also be best articulated in the cold light of day rather than in the heat of a crisis.
The NDP support for the Emergencies Act does not necessarily sit easily or well with many of its members. If Singh were to reach a different conclusion before the vote, chances are some of his MPs and more than a few New Democrats would breathe a sigh of relief.
Meanwhile, by keeping the door open to a change of heart, Singh has managed to land on the good side of public opinion while keeping his caucus united.
That's more than one can say about Trudeau's Liberals and the Conservative official opposition.
Neither will emerge from the events of the past few weeks with flying colours.
The blockades accelerated the demise of former Conservative leader Erin O'Toole.
The flirting between leading members of the official opposition and those manning the blockades has resulted in deeper divisions within the Conservative party.
Trudeau's hands-off approach to the first weeks of the blockades, only to be followed by an all-hands-on-deck demonstration of strength, has caused more Canadians to wonder whether he is still the person for the job of prime minister. Some of those asking themselves that question are Liberal members.
Among the leaders of the main parties in Parliament, Singh has kept the more consistent course. He has also seemed more able than his Liberal and Conservative counterparts to look beyond the partisan picture. The fate of the Emergencies Act could be in worse hands.

Full text: It will be up to Ontario's chief medical officer of health to determine when it is safe to lift the province's pandemic mask mandate, says Premier Doug Ford.
In the wake of Dr. Kieran Moore's announcement that the mandatory indoor mask policy will be reviewed in March, Ford stressed he would defer to "health and science."
Speaking to reporters Friday at a campaign-style event in Whitby, the premier said he must "wait for the recommendations" from his top public health adviser.
"He's sent recommendations in as we're winding down and I'm going to follow his advice," Ford said.
"We have a great plan. We're going to follow that plan. We're going to do it cautiously and move forward cautiously," he said, claiming he has "been accused of being the most cautious leader in North America when it comes to this pandemic."
That's apparently a reference to the fact Ontario has faced longer COVID-19 lockdowns that any other province or U.S. state and its students have missed more in-person classes than anywhere on the continent.
But the province has fared better in terms of deaths per capita than any of its neighbours.
Ontario, with a population of 14.8 million, has lost 12,204 people to COVID-19. Quebec, home to 8.5 million, has suffered 13,812 deaths.
"I'm going to continue being cautious, but we also have to move forward ...We have to get our lives back to normal as well," Ford said.
On Thursday, Moore said "the worst is behind us, but there is an ongoing risk" so masks will be required for a while longer.
Masks that cover the mouth and nose have been mandatory in nearly all indoor settings outside homes in most of Ontario since July 2020.

Vaccine policies 'no longer necessary,' Ontario top doc wants to remove them March 1

Full text: TORONTO - Ontario's top doctor wants to end workplace COVID-19 vaccination policies by early next month when proof-of-vaccination rules will lift in other businesses and indoor settings.
Now that COVID-19 hospitalizations and other indicators are improving, Dr. Kieran Moore said Thursday that he's reviewing letters of instruction sent last year to various sectors including hospitals and post-secondary institutions, which required that they develop immunization policies.
"We do think the highest risk is behind us, that we're heading into a lower risk environment, and that the need for vaccination policies across Ontario sectors, whether it's health, or in colleges and universities, is no longer necessary," Moore said at a news conference.
"I do think we should align their removal with the removal at a population level, so on March 1. That may be early for some organizations, but that's my goal."
Most sectors were instructed to require people to get regularly tested for the virus if they are not vaccinated, but many took their policies further and required all workers get the shots. More than a dozen hospitals told The Canadian Press this week that they intend to keep mandates for workers in place when the vaccine certificate system ends.
Long-term care is the only sector in Ontario that has mandated workers get vaccinated against COVID-19, but Moore said Thursday that the directive from the sector did not come from him, so it wouldn't be included in the rollback of other vaccination policies.
He also did not specify whether a vaccinate-or-test policy would remain for school employees. Education workers who aren't vaccinated currently have to take regular virus tests.
Moore's remarks came as the province rolled back capacity restrictions affecting many businesses a few days ahead of schedule.
His comments also came days after Premier Doug Ford said he's eager to end all pandemic-related mandates and "move forward" from the pandemic because people are "done" with public health restrictions. Ford and Moore have denied that their recent shift to accelerate the end of COVID-19 measures has been motivated by a rash of protests across the country aimed at forcing governments to do that.
The province hasn't yet set a date for when it will lift masking in public spaces and schools, but Moore said Thursday he would begin reviewing the policy and make a decision in the secondor third week of March once other restrictions are lifted.
Moore didn't give specific details on how the province plans to handle any future surge in cases but said the province has learned from the last two years of the pandemic and has new tools such as vaccinations to fight off the virus.
Businesses said the mood was positive on Thursday as capacity limits lifted in gyms, restaurants, cinemas and others that still accept proof-of-vaccination, but some remained cautious about barrelling ahead with reopening.
"It definitely is a happy day. It's the first time in about two years that we're finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel for these poor small businesses," said Julie Kwiecinski, director of provincial affairs, Ontario, for the Canadian Federation of Independent Business.
Despite that, she said operators are concerned about consumer confidence and they want the government to encourage people to get out and patronize businesses safely.
Kwiecinski said business owners also want a "stay open" plan from the government about how it will avoid future shutdowns if cases surge and threaten the health system again, especially in the fall after June's provincial election.
"As much as we all want to jump for joy and say this is over, I think everybody realizes that it's not over, that it's a matter of how you manage it going forward," she said. "We definitely need to see from this government what their plans are for staying open."
Recent data from the CFIB found that 74 per cent of surveyed members supported ending capacity restrictions and 66 per cent of the businesses supported ending vaccine passport rules for customers.
Still, some Ontario businesses intended to keep them in place a while longer, even if the province doesn't require them.
Mandy Brouse, who co-owns Words Worth Books in Waterloo, Ont., said her store would remain at close to 50 per cent capacity for the next little while.
"We've always stayed a step behind any of the mandates, mostly because we want to really keep our staff and customers safe," she said in an interview.
"We do have some immunocompromised staff members at our store, so their health and safety ... are at the forefront of my mind."
She said customers have sent in positive feedback about the business' slow reopening plan. The store might decide to expand capacity if staff are comfortable with it and virus indicators in the area improve, but Brouse said a cautious approach has served the store well so far.
James Rilett, vice president of central Canada for Restaurants Canada, said some restaurants might consider keeping vaccine passports and social distancing rules in place, but such decisions are difficult to make after years of revenue difficulties from the pandemic.
"It's a tough thing to turn down customers when you're facing such a mountain of debt," he said.
Recent comments by Moore about the reduced effectiveness of vaccine passports against the Omicron variant have also made it tough to continue enforcing them, Rilett said.
"It puts them in a difficult position, even if they want to do that," he said.
This report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 17, 2022.

Full text: With an Ontario election less than four months away, Premier Doug Ford is removing tolls from Highway 412 in Whitby and Highway 418 in Clarington.
But Ford’s campaign-style pledge does not apply to Highway 407, which was sold to a private consortium by Progressive Conservative premier Mike Harris before the 1999 election, or the newer publicly owned section of that tollway into Durham Region.
“You can hop on that highway and you can drive for free,” Ford told reporters Friday in Whitby, noting toll charges will be lifted as of April 5.
That’s one month before the official start of the June 2 election campaign.
The two highways, which connect Highway 401 and Highway 407, are the only provincially owned north-south toll roads in Ontario.
Tolls are around 30 cents a kilometre for motorists and 80 cents for commercial transports.
The highways were built by the previous Liberal government, in which current Grit leader Steven Del Duca was transportation minister. Highway 412 opened in 2016 and Highway 418 opened in 2019.
“I just want to remind you the person that put in these tolls was Steven Del Duca. He was the architect of this. He said … he will never get rid of tolls. Well, we don’t believe that,” said Ford, who has been criticized for leaving the fees in place since his government was elected in 2018.
“We have heard the people of Durham loud and clear and we agree that the tolls imposed on Highways 412 and 418 by the previous government are wrong and unfair.”
Durham residents have long complained that the public highways were subject to tolls, unlike most others in Ontario.
That led to increased congestion on adjacent streets as commuters tried to avoid the charges.
Councils in Whitby, Ajax and Durham Region have all passed motions imploring the province to remove the levies.
Ron Stevens, a Durham resident who has been pushing for the changes for years, said it was “welcome news and long overdue” for the community.
“It is unfortunate that Premier Ford blames the previous government for something his transportation minister (Caroline Mulroney) defended and said was justified to build these roads,” said Stevens, who also blasted local Tory MPP Lorne Coe for not moving sooner.
“This community has been treated very unfairly and they have now acknowledged that for the first time, obviously due to an election coming soon.”
A provincial report last April found the little-used highways were projected to generate $580 million in revenue for the treasury over the next three decades.
In 2019, Highway 412 had 12,200 daily drivers while Highway 418 had 3,100 drivers.
That compares with the 400,000 drivers who use Highway 400 each day between Highways 401 and 407.
NDP MPP Jennifer French (Oshawa), who has advocated for the removal of the tolls, hailed the announcement as “a big victory that’s long overdue.”
“That was a terrible move from Steven Del Duca and the Liberals,” said French, stressing the Tories share blame.
“Doug Ford could and should have removed the tolls of on Highways 412 and 418 years ago. Instead, his government let my 2018 (private member’s) bill to end the tolls languish at committee,” she said.
“That means drivers shelled out extra cash for an extra four years just because Doug Ford wanted to wait until just before an election to do what was right all along.”
Pressure had mounted on Ford to cancel the charges after he promised the proposed Highway 413 and Bradford Bypass would not be tolled.

Full text: Police began their crackdown in downtown Ottawa as trucker-led convoy protesters continue to cause chaos in the city. Arrests were made on Thursday including convoy organizer Tamara Lich. Follow the Star’s live coverage.
10 p.m. Government House leader Mark Holland says the House of Commons will resume debate Saturday on the use of the Emergencies Act to respond to the illegal blockades.
This morning the Speaker and House leaders from all parties agreed to cancel today's (Friday's) sitting on the advice of parliamentary security.
Holland says on Twitter that the safety of MPs and all employees on Parliament Hill is paramount.
The House began debating the government's decision to invoke the Emergencies Act on Thursday.
Earlier, Holland said the pause would not affect the outcome and MPs who want to speak will do so.
He said MPs will vote early next week on the Emergencies Act motion.
8 p.m. (UPDATED) The Ottawa Police Service says officers have arrested more than 100 people in the crackdown on anti-government protesters in the city.
Police also say more than 20 vehicles have been towed in the push to end the three-week occupation of the capital.
Chris Barber, a protest organizer arrested yesterday, has been released on bail on the conditions he leaves Ontario by Wednesday and not publicly endorse the convoy or have any contact with the other major protest organizers.
Tamara Lich, another protest organizer who was arrested yesterday, is to appear in Ottawa court tomorrow morning for her bail hearing.
7:35 p.m. On Thursday they were told they would be arrested if they did not end their illegal occupation of Ottawa.
The next day hundreds of heavily armed police moved in to make good on that warning. Yet even as several of the convoy’s leaders were detained, and trucks began to be towed, many protesters and their supporters seemed undeterred by the growing police presence. As their fellow occupiers were arrested, some said they didn’t believe it would happen to them. Others said they were willing to fight for their cause.
On Wellington Street in front of Parliament Hill, the convoy’s infamous bouncy castle — now deflated — sits across from a makeshift daycare, with lawn games for kids and a box holding what looked like children’s toys. Children could be seen playing in the area Friday afternoon.
The Star’s Jenna Moon reports from Ottawa: Protesters play music and dance as police close in
5:55 p.m. (UPDATED) In two tweets posted early Friday evening , Ottawa police said protesters had assaulted officers and attempted to remove their weapons .
As the “assaultive behaviour” continued, police sent in mounted officers to separate protesters from the police line.
“As this was happening a bicycle was thrown at the feet of one of the horses in an attempt to injure it,” one tweet read. “One person was arrested for intentionally harming a police service animal.”
Earlier in the day, interim police chief Steve Bell said aside from a minor injury sustained by one officer, there were no other injuries so far despite several scuffles between demonstrators and police.
Riot squads and mounted police continue to slowly advance westbound toward Parliament Hill, an operation police said will continue around the clock.
5:00 p.m. A group involved in the anti-government protest against COVID-19 measures in Ottawa is asking a court to put the brakes on federal use of the Emergencies Act to clamp down on demonstrators.
In a filing in Federal Court today, Canadian Frontline Nurses and member Kristen Nagle seek an injunction staying the Liberal government's use of the emergencies law and associated measures while their full case plays out in court.
The nurses group and Nagle say they are opposed to unreasonable COVID-19-related mandates and restrictions that have been implemented by various levels of Canadian governments.
They want a court declaration that the federal government strayed beyond its jurisdiction in declaring a public order emergency earlier this week, saying the move was unconstitutional.
They also seek all orders-in-council, minutes of meetings, cabinet submissions, memorandums, agreements and constituting documents relating to the public order emergency proclamation.
The court filing comes as police officers make arrests and tow vehicles in downtown Ottawa in an effort to end what police call an illegal protest.
4:45 p.m. The street in front of Parliament Hill is clearer than it was this morning after a handful of vehicles departed.
At least three semis that were parked parallel to the Centre Block left during the day, with one remaining driver saying the vehicles relocated elsewhere.
Where he didn't say.
Police are warning anyone remaining downtown could have their vehicle towed, even if they want to leave but are boxed in.
Protesters, meanwhile, have set up snow barricades across roads just south of Wellington Street, including one outside Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office that has hockey sticks poking out the top.
3:50 p.m. Police have arrested 70 people as they clear the protests in Ottawa, interim chief Steve Bell said at a news conference. Police set up 100 checkpoints Thursday night and started making arrests Friday. Those arrested include “key individuals who were responsible for organizing these unlawful activities,” who have been charged with “various offences, including mischief.”
“These are not the images Ottawa wants to see,” said Bell, who added that police will continue the operation “until residents and citizens have their city back.”
Asked if police used new powers granted under the Emergency Measures Act, Bell said the police had used new and existing powers to clear the protest and this “could not have been done without these powers.”
“We will move slowly and safely and respect people’s Charter rights,” Bell added.
He commended police officers for their professionalism in the face of “taunts and slurs.”
“It shocks and surprises me that people put children in harm’s way, in the middle of a police operation,” Bell said
3:15 p.m. An Ontario judge has extended an order to keep a busy international bridge clear, The Canadian Press reports.
Ontario Superior Court Chief Justice Geoffrey Morawetz has granted an extension of an injunction that prohibits blocking access to the Ambassador Bridge after his previous order was set to expire Monday, according to CP.
Canada-bound traffic was blocked for a week at the bridge that connects Windsor, Ont., with Detroit by protesters who oppose COVID-19 measures and vaccine mandates.
The city argued there was an imminent threat by protesters to block the bridge again.
3:04 p.m. Protest organizers sent conflicting signals of defiance and retreat to so-called “Freedom Convoy” demonstrators, who remained dug in around Parliament Hill on Friday, as hundreds of police officers started to clear the 22-day occupation, forcing both Houses of Canada’s federal legislature to shut down, the Toronto Star’s Rob Ferguson reports.
Just moments after Ottawa police accused protesters of using children as shields from law enforcement, some convoy organizers took to social media to call on convoy demonstrators to stand down, according to the Star’s Ferguson.
In a video posted on Facebook, organizer Pat King said protesters who don’t want to face the police crackdown should leave, and that he had spoken with local police whom he said confirmed they would be allowed to drive their trucks out of the downtown core.
“We’re not retreating, we’re regrouping,” King said, telling protesters to drive to a truck stop in Arnprior, a town west of Ottawa, before returning to the city at some unspecified time.
Moments later, King appeared to livestream a video of his own arrest as he drove his truck. “I’m being arrested, we’ll talk to you guys soon,” he said before signing off.
Ottawa police would not immediately confirm that King had been arrested, though they later stated 21 people had been arrested by mid-afternoon Friday, and that 21 vehicles had been towed.
3 p.m. Police continue to push back a crowd gathered at a major intersection near Parliament Hill, The Canadian Press reports.
Shouting at protesters to move back officers formed a line across Sussex Drive, according to CP.
Those in the crowd were warned through a speaker to move back or face being arrested.
The crowd watched as police ordered a camper van be towed whose windows had been smashed in.
2:47 p.m. Just north of the Rideau Centre, a number of flatbed tow trucks now occupy the space previously taken up by protesters and their trucks and vehicles. The tow trucks appear to have City of Ottawa logos on the side of them. The private tow trucks appear to have either had their decals removed or masked.
On his Facebook livestream, Pat King urged drivers in the area to use their vehicles to block a road where he said tow trucks were amassing to help police clear the parked protesters.
King threatened tow truck operators working with police that he would find out who they are.
2:40 p.m. Ottawa police say 21 people have been arrested and 21 vehicles have been towed as the force steps up enforcement against anti-government protesters who have been camped outside Parliament Hill, The Canadian Press reports.
The force made the announcement after police clad in riot gear and touting gas masks and tear-gas guns converged on a large crowd of protesters to contain them near the Westin Hotel in downtown Ottawa, according to CP.
2:10 p.m. (update) Ottawa police say 21 people have been arrested and 21 vehicles have been towed Friday. Police say Nicholas Street is clear, and that operations continue on Rideau and Sussex.
More than a dozen trucks appear to have left the area where occupiers have been camped out for weeks in Ottawa.
Police towed trucks away from an area on the eastern edge of Ottawa’s downtown core. Tow trucks could be seen moving the vehicles from Nicholas Street after making arrests there earlier this morning.
1:53 p.m. Two blocks west of where police have amassed in riot gear, there are children playing with toys in one of the makeshift play areas set up by protesters on Wellington Street in front of the West Block. The Children’s Aid Society of Ottawa is working closely alongside police to help ensure the safety and well-being of children who are a part of the occupation. The organization says that as police action unfolds, parents who are involved should make the necessary alternate care arrangements for their children should they be arrested or detained. On Thursday, Bill Blair, the federal emergency preparedness minister, again told parents to take their children home, “This is no place for children, take them home immediately. Take them to a safe place.”
1:39 p.m. There are new reports that one of the key security figures who was part of the convoy organization has been arrested. Daniel Bulford’s spouse said in a Facebook live video that Bulford turned himself in and has been arrested.
1:32 p.m. Premier Doug Ford, who endorsed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Emergencies Act, touts “permanent” measures to prevent protests like the recent Ambassador Bridge siege. “Absolutely no way that people are going to go there and block a trading corridor ... It’s unacceptable,” said Ford.
1:14 p.m. There are reports that several of the trucks and cabs that have blocked downtown Ottawa streets for weeks have been abandoned by their drivers and left unlocked. Protesters have reportedly passed this information along to police.
1:11 p.m. Heavily-armed Quebec provincial police officers in tactical gear have gathered near Chateau Laurier, several hundred meters Parliament Hill.
12:59 p.m. In a video posted on Facebook, organizer Pat King said protesters who don’t want to face the police crackdown should leave, and that he had spoken with local police whom he said confirmed they would be allowed to drive their trucks out of the downtown core.
“We’re not retreating, we’re re-grouping,” King said, telling protesters to drive to a truck stop in Arnprior, a town west of Ottawa, before returning to the city at some unspecified time.
“Those that do now want to take part and do not want to hold the line, you have the option to pull out,” he said.
“We’re going to be the ones to turn around and walk away, because we don’t want violence.”
Moments later, King appeared to livestream a video of his own arrest as he drove his truck. “I’m being arrested, we’ll talk to you guys soon,” he said, before signing off.
12:55 p.m. Protesters appear to be using road pylons and shovels in order to build what some believe is snow wall to keep police at bay.
12:49 p.m. (update) The line of police on Rideau Street has expanded and also includes officers from Toronto police, Sudbury police and York police.
12:44 p.m. Pat King, organizer and supporter of convoy protests appears to have been arrested based off claims King made on his Facebook live stream.
12:43 p.m. Protestors are reportedly piling up snow in an effort to block the central blockade off from the police who are moving in from the east just a few blocks away.
12:26 p.m. More protesters have joined a group facing off with heavily-armed police officers on Rideau Street in Ottawa. A small number appear to have been detained and taken away. Many are lined up, some on their knees and hugging and holding hands. Experts have said this is a tactic by protesters to argue that their occupation is peaceful and within their constitutional right to gather in protest.
One family, with several crying young children in tow, were led away by police after it appeared someone familiar to the family was arrested by police.
12:10 p.m. Ottawa police say “some protestors have put children in between police operations and the unlawful protest site. The children will be brought to a place of safety,” according to a tweet Friday afternoon.
11:58 a.m. Ottawa police say 15 people have been arrested and at least four vehicles towed on Friday. Police say Nicholas Street has been “cleared” as “police operations continue on Rideau St.”
Some protesters are linking hands, chanting “stand with us” at the approaching police units. Elsewhere, near the intersection of Metcalfe and Wellington, music has stopped and an emcee alerted protesters that police were headed their way, according to Star journalists on the ground. “We’re not doing anything wrong, as long as we stay peaceful, we’re allowed to be here,” said a protestor on a mic at the makeshift soundstage.
11:31 a.m. (updated) Heavily armed RCMP officers in armoured vehicles appear to be moving in near the Rideau Centre in Ottawa, followed by a long line of police SUV vehicles. A large number of police officers have gathered on the street. A handful of people have linked arms at the front of the blockade singing Oh Canada, some on their knees, met with a wall of police officers in bright yellow vests on Rideau Street between Sussex Drive and Nicholas Street.
Protesters appear to be sharing information among themselves of the heavy police presence and towing of vehicles, with some making their way towards where police and protesters are facing off.
11:15 a.m. The Children’s Aid Society of Ottawa says it is working closely alongside police to help ensure the safety and well-being of children in downtown Ottawa.
The society says it has not yet had to intervene with regard to children or youth connected to the demonstration, nor have any been transferred to the care of the society.
It says that as police action unfolds, parents involved should make the necessary alternate care arrangements for their children.
11:13 a.m. Police have started towing trucks away from an area on the eastern edge of Ottawa’s downtown core.
Tow trucks could be seen moving the vehicles from Nicholas Street after making arrests there earlier this morning.
Police say other people who have taken part in the three-week-long protest in Ottawa have decided to leave on their own accord.
They are warning anyone who doesn’t leave may be arrested.
But not everyone is ready to leave.
One trucker parked by the city’s Rideau Centre shopping mall says he is willing to get arrested before moving.
On Kent Street, near the western edge of the core, two protesters say they don’t plan to leave either.
One, who only provided his first name, Dave, says he expects thousands of people to pour back into the core this weekend despite the 100 checkpoints that police have set up to prevent anyone from joining the convoy.
Asked about the police warnings, Dave says it’s a little nerve-racking, but adds that protesters are peaceful people.
11:10 a.m. In Coutts, Alberta RCMP seized a number of weapons, firearms ammunition, as well as police-issued body armour in an overnight raid on a number of trailers associated with blockade. A number of people were arrested and taken into custody. An RCMP spokesperson also said one its officers was nearly struck when someone tried to ram a police cruiser and attempted to drive through a police blockade on Friday.
11:03 a.m. (updated) Ottawa police are warning once again of a “concerted effort to flood our 911” lines, adding that this puts lives in danger.“It is a crime to unnecessarily call 911 or our non-emergency number… We track calls and will charge anyone deliberately interfering with emergencies,” they said on Twitter.
Police say they are tracking calls and will charge anyone who is deliberately interfering with emergencies.
Police also say that if protesters choose to leave the area but cannot move their vehicles, they will be towed to a location where protesters can pick them up.
10:40 a.m. Pat King, another organizer and prominent supporter of the protests, streamed a video on Facebook Friday morning, during which he called for demonstrators to take cabs and Uber rides into the downtown core and to lie at checkpoints to say they live or work in the area.
He also urged any drivers in the area to use their vehicles to block a road where he said tow trucks were amassing to help police clear the parked protesters.
King threatened tow truck operators working with police that he would find out who they are.
“Your soul just got sold to the devil, and you’re going to find out whose tow trucks did what,” he said. “You’re committing friggin’ career suicide right now... They paid you a s—-ton of cash, and we know it. Bad, bad, bad.”
King also mentioned organizers have a “contingency plan” and asked protesters to follow it if needed, suggesting they might call on them to “move.”
10:24 a.m. Protesters who are part of the convoy of trucks and other vehicles occupying Ottawa’s downtown area don’t appear to be in a hurry to leave. Occupiers can be seen dancing to music and enthusiastically waving Canadian flags in an intersection near Wellington Street.
9:38 a.m. (updated) Officials are warning Ottawa residents about commuting into the downtown core. LRT service has been paused with shuttle buses in operation, and access to the downtown area remains limited.
The OPP are informing drivers of ongoing road closures. A number of Highway 417 exits to downtown Ottawa are closed, including eastbound at Rochester, Kent, Metcalfe and Nicholas, and westbound at Bronson, Metcalfe, Nicholas and Vanier. The OPP say these closures are not checkpoints.
So far, the downtown streets are remarkably empty of people and other non-occupation vehicles. The majority of the people there are occupiers, police and journalists.
9:33 a.m. A line of police officers separate media from the convoy along Nicholas Street at the Mackenzie King Bridge in Ottawa. A heavy police presence is developing as more officers arrive. Some protesters are leaving willingly.
8:16 a.m. Ottawa police warned people on Friday about a large police presence on Nicholas Street. “Protesters are being advised to leave immediately. Some protesters are surrendering and are being arrested. We ask protesters to remain peaceful and lawful,” reads the tweet .
8:10 a.m. The lights on police vehicles are flickering in intersections across Ottawa’s downtown core Friday morning.
Officers are checking every vehicle looking to get into the secure area that spans roughly four square kilometres. Officers from provincial, national and other municipal forces are policing the perimeter with about 100 checkpoints to keep out anyone intent on joining the protest.
Trucks are idling on the street in front of Parliament Hill as a bitter winter storm pummels the national capital, covering vehicles in snow and ice.
8 a.m. Ottawa police say Tamara Lich, a key organizer of the convoy protest that has seized the city for weeks, has a court appearance scheduled Friday.
Police say Lich, 49, from Medicine Hat, Alta., has been charged with counselling to commit mischief.
Police say they issued a notice to protesters Thursday advising that anyone blocking streets or helping others to block them is committing a criminal offence and could be arrested. Protesters were also told to cease unlawful activity or they would face charges or fines.
7:40 a.m. Both chambers of Canada’s Parliament cancelled sittings Friday due to the ongoing police operation in Ottawa’s downtown city core.
The Commons was set to continue a historic second day of debate on the proclamation of a “public order emergency.” But on the advice of parliamentary security, both the Senate and the Commons have suspended work Friday.
Ottawa police, bolstered by outside forces, set up more than 100 checkpoints around the city, trying to prevent additional protesters from joining the convoy protest over the long weekend.
Ramps and routes into downtown Ottawa were closed overnight, with checkpoints set up and slowing traffic into the area. Only those who live or work there are permitted into the massive secure zone.

6:55 a.m. The father of a man facing a charge of conspiracy to commit murder says his son had become increasingly radicalized online before he was arrested and accused of plotting to kill police officers in connection with the border blockade in Coutts, Alta.
In an hour-long interview at the Lethbridge home they share, Mike Lysak described the frustration he says he’s felt over the past two years watching his son, Chris, fall further and further into an online world of COVID-19 misinformation.
The Star spoke to Lysak and others connected to the arrests this week, in interviews that open a window into the journey that has led some of the accused to this point. Police have described the arrests as focusing on “a small, organized group” engaged in “dangerous criminal activity occurring away from the TV cameras” that “could have been deadly for citizens, protesters and officers.” Some of those interviewed called into question or outright rejected the RCMP’s characterization of events.

6:45 a.m. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association is taking the federal government to court over what it calls an “unprecedented” use of government powers by activating the Emergencies Act to end the protest that’s been occupying downtown Ottawa for more than two weeks.
The CCLA argues that Ottawa has bypassed democratic norms in using the act to deal with the protest, and that the situation hasn’t met the threshold needed to justify it, said spokesperson Abby Deshman. The association is now seeking to nullify the use of the act.
“We believe the federal government invocation of these power is unlawful and unconstitutional,” Deshman said Thursday.

6:41 a.m. An Ottawa judge has frozen the bank accounts and digital “wallets” of convoy leaders believed to hold more than $1 million in bitcoin and cryptocurrency after an extraordinary secret hearing.
Late Thursday, Ontario Superior Court Justice Calum MacLeod granted an injunction to a private citizens’ effort to stanch the flow of money that was a lifeline for the 21-day occupation of Ottawa.
MacLeod issued the sweeping order freezing all the digital assets and bank accounts of convoy leaders, several of whom are directors of a corporation they created three weeks ago.

Friday 6 a.m. Ottawa is holding its collective breath as police appear ready to finally end the so called Freedom Convoy protest that has paralyzed a good chunk of the capital city’s downtown core for the past three weeks.
With significantly bolstered ranks municipal, provincial and national police officers have established a perimeter with about 100 checkpoints covering Ottawa’s downtown to keep out anyone intent on joining the protest this weekend.
They have also arrested a number people, including two organizers of the protest against COVID-19 public health measures. Tamara Lich was in custody Thursday night charged with counselling to commit mischief, while Chris Barber was also facing that charge along with charges of obstruction and counselling to commit obstruction.
As snow blanketed the city Thursday police spent much of the day going around warning protesters, once again, to pack up and pullout now, or else risk arrest and other tough sanctions.
But many demonstrators still refused to budge. And city residents, who have grown increasingly frustrated with their lives being upended by the protest, are now waiting to see if police will back up their words with action to take back the streets.
Thursday 10:40 p.m. Police in Ottawa have set up checkpoints throughout the downtown area to prevent protesters from entering the core of the capital.
Officers stationed throughout downtown can be seen peering into vehicle windows with their flashlights to ask travellers where they’re headed.
Interim police Chief Steve Bell says only people who aren’t protesting will be able to get downtown this weekend.
The police also appear to have shut down highway exits and light rail stops downtown.
Meanwhile, a lawyer for Tamara Lich, one of the protest organizers, says she has been charged with one count of counselling mischief and was still in custody following her arrest earlier tonight.

Police arrest two protest organizers: Officers patrol downtown Ottawa in greater numbers as force promises 'imminent' crackdown

Full text: Parliament Hill now exists in two different - and conflicting - realities.
In one, a dangerous group of unlawful protesters face an "imminent" crackdown as police flex their muscle and politicians warn of grave consequences for those who don't leave now.
In the other: defiance, dancing and devotion to a cause that many in the remaining "Freedom Convoy" crowd see as a struggle between good and evil.
By late Thursday, police were patrolling the streets around Parliament Hill in greater numbers, issuing tickets to parked and idling vehicles, and had made several arrests.
Tamara Lich, a key convoy organizer who on Wednesday night suggested in an online video that her arrest was "inevitable," was taken into custody by police Thursday evening according to images posted on social media. Another top organizer, Chris Barber, was also arrested several hours earlier, according to media reports.
Keith Wilson, the lawyer representing the convoy, confirmed the arrests to The Canadian Press.
After allowing a protest against COVID-19 vaccination mandates and public health restrictions to turn into a weeks-long occupation of the capital's downtown, Ottawa police trumpeted a "hardened" stance on Thursday, armed with the special powers granted by the federal government's invocation for the first time of the Emergencies Act.
Interim Ottawa police Chief Steve Bell announced Thursday afternoon that "action is imminent" as officers from his and other police forces set up a perimeter around Parliament Hill and established a secured zone across a wide swath of downtown streets.
Ottawa police said only people who live or work in businesses in the city's downtown core will be allowed to go there.
Highway access into the city centre will also be restricted, with 100 police checkpoints scattered across the core to ensure additional protesters cannot descend on the capital for the fourth straight weekend of noisy and disruptive demonstrations.
"What I can tell you is that this weekend will look very different from the past three weekends," Bell said.
The province passed emergency regulations last week that declared 400-series highways as critical infrastructure, and allow police extraordinary powers to secure traffic flow.
Many more security fences were erected around Parliament and served as the backdrop to a bitterly divisive debate on the Trudeau government's declaration of a national "public order emergency."
Lawmakers will continue debating the need for emergency powers almost around the clock until it comes to a vote on Monday. The Sergeant at Arms sent MPs a note saying a police action would be happening on Friday.
While the vote could revoke the federal emergency proclamation, the new police powers it grants to establish no-go zones and ban travel to and from "unlawful assemblies" are already in force.
Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair warned the protesters that the demonstration site was "no place for children."
"Take them home immediately," Blair said. "Take them to a safe place."
Outside, among the trucks on Wellington Street, two men laughed and played with toy trucks in a small, inflatable hot tub filled with bubbling water - a sight that the former chair of Ottawa's police board described in exasperation this week as a symbol of Ottawa's "carnival of chaos."
Elsewhere, protesters cooked food on a barbecue while parked transport trucks periodically erupted in bursts of honking. In front of the Prime Minister's Office, a man played a tuba in a crowd of dancing protesters. Another man with a harmonica and guitar delivered a rendition of Bob Dylan's "Blowin' In the Wind" from a stage beneath a Canadian flag flapping from the end of a large crane.
Derek Barnett, who came to the protest on Thursday from Orangeville, was walking near the Prime Minister's Office with his mother and her friend. Barnett wore a red baseball cap with the slogan, "Drain the Swamp!" - a phrase associated with former U.S. president Donald Trump that refers to alleged government corruption.
Barnett said he joined the protests because he wants all pandemic health restrictions lifted and questioned whether the police warnings about imminent arrests were real.
He also slammed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for invoking the Emergencies Act to deal with what he believes to be a peaceful protest.
Asked whether he is willing to be arrested, Barnett said he would consider that a badge of honour.
"That would be my Purple Heart," he said, referring to an American military award given to those injured or killed in combat. "I'm a casualty of war at that point ... It does feel like 'good versus evil.'"
At 1 p.m., a solid cacophony of horns and train whistles blasted in unison for several minutes. It was a show of support to mark the prayers of a group of Christian protesters who had been walking around Parliament Hill every afternoon for the past seven days - a reference, some demonstrators explained, to the Biblical story of how the Israelites marched around the walls of Jericho before God made them fall.
"The Lord is on our side. We don't worry about it. I know Trudeau will come down too," said John Jonker, who owns a trucking company in Guelph, Ont., and came to the protests with a fleet of his fellow drivers.
In his view, the protesters' opposition to COVID-19 health restrictions is part of a "religious struggle" and he said he is convinced the "truth" of their cause will prevail, regardless of what police do.
Jonker said he was not worried about the police, expressing doubts that they would follow through on their threat to take action against the demonstrators.
"The police helped us get in here," he said, referring to a deal made by Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson that allowed truckers to move onto the street in front of Parliament from the residential streets where they initially parked.
Jonker also dismissed any concerns about warnings that the federal government could freeze assets such as his trucking company and personal bank accounts.
"We're not worried about that. You know why? They took our jobs away" - referring to the federal quarantine requirement for unvaccinated truckers crossing the Canada-U. S. border - "so our bank accounts are empty anyway.
"So what can they freeze? As long as we are honest, as long as we really speak the truth, we tell the truth, then we don't worry about it at all. They may take everything away."
A citizens' effort to oust the occupation also continued Thursday, with a class-action lawsuit expanded to include a number of individual protesters who publicly spoke out over the past three weeks, and 62 unnamed participants, identified as John or Jane Doe.
The lawsuit is seeking $306 million in damages, as well as legal costs.
Meanwhile, the federal government tried to make its case in the House of Commons for why it is necessary to resort to exceptional emergency powers to end the protest.
It presented documents accompanying the motion to support the emergency declaration that said the "situation across the country remains concerning, volatile and unpredictable."
For the first time, the government said, "threats were also made to block railway lines, which would result in significant disruptions" to trade corridors that carry $310 billion in goods each year.
While border blockades had been cleared and traffic had resumed at Coutts, Alta., and Emerson, Man., the government signalled the overall threat has not ended, and that democratic institutions in Canada were under attack.
"The protests have become a rallying point for anti-government and anti-authority, anti-vaccination, conspiracy theory and white supremacist groups throughout Canada and other Western countries. The protesters have varying ideological grievances, with demands ranging from an end to all public health restrictions to the overthrow of the elected government," the documents said.
Describing the chaos in Ottawa, it cited the resignation of Ottawa police chief Peter Sloly "in response to criticism of the police's response to the protests."
Several premiers opposed the use of the Emergencies Act within their territories, including Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Quebec. New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and PEI have said they don't believe their provinces require it. Others like Ontario and Newfoundland and Labrador supported the federal government's response.
While the Conservatives and Bloc Québécois oppose the move by Trudeau's minority government, it has the support of the New Democrats.

Full text: The political division over the use of the federal Emergencies Act became as solidly entrenched as the concrete blocks now ringing Parliament Hill as debate over the unprecedented use of the law began Thursday in the House of Commons.
Where the Liberals argued threats to national security are so severe as to require time-limited but sweeping new powers for police and other authorities, the Conservatives saw a national unity crisis being fanned by the prime minister himself.
Using the act to create new rules and regulations aimed at ending a three-week-long occupation of the national capital is an erosion of the rights and freedoms of Canadians and a complete overreach, the Conservatives said Thursday.
"This is not a game," said interim Conservative Leader Candice Bergen as she laid out the reasons her party won't support the declaration of a public order emergency.
"It comes at the cost to Canadians' rights and freedoms," she said. "Parliament should not allow the prime minister to avoid responsibility in this way. I urge all members of this House, proceed with extreme caution."
But the Conservatives' own position did not escape attacks from the Liberals or the NDP, who continued to point out that many MPs have vocally supported the so-called Freedom Convoy in recent weeks, even as its rhetoric and harassment of local residents heated up.
A truck parked just across the street from the House of Commons bears a flag calling for Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre to become the next prime minister. Poilievre is so far the only candidate in the race to become his party's next leader.
What MPs will vote on specifically is a motion confirming a declaration of a public order emergency, a requirement of the Emergencies Act that was invoked on Monday night. With it came a slew of new policing and other powers to cut off and criminalize sources of funding for the protesters, as well as the ability for people to join in further protests and blockades.
Liberals insist that the Charter of Rights and Freedoms will be upheld and peaceful protests will be allowed to continue, but say the economic and social threats posed by the "Freedom Convoy" demonstrators must come to an end.
"We are not limiting people's freedom of expression. We are not limiting freedom of peaceful assembly. We are not preventing people from exercising their right to protest legally. We are, in fact, reinforcing the principles, values and institutions that keep all Canadians free," Trudeau said.
If MPs fail to vote in favour of the declaration, it would be revoked immediately.
For now, the New Democrats are on side, although Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet - who opposes the declaration - said he was going to talk to NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh to see if they could reach a "mutual understanding."
The Bloc opposes the emergency declaration on the grounds that it steps too far into Quebec's jurisdiction, and that the border blockades in Alberta and Windsor that have been used in part to justify its invocation were cleared without using any of the extra powers provided by the act.
The government could have found a strategy somewhere "between playing Pontius Pilate and attacking with the atomic bomb," Bloc MP Alain Therrien said at one point during the debate.
Singh has been pressed to defend his support of invoking the act by the Tories and BQ. They noted that then-NDP leader Tommy Douglas had opposed the use of the War Measures Act - the precursor to the Emergencies Act - in 1970, when prime minister Pierre Trudeau invoked it in response to the kidnapping and eventual murder of Quebec's deputy premier.
Singh said that while what's happening in the streets of Ottawa goes beyond a peaceful protest, questions must be asked about the failure of local police to solve the problem - and why it appeared some may even be in support of the demonstrations.
"Occupiers get hugs from the police, while Indigenous and racialized protesters are met with the barrel of a gun," he said.
The daylong debate seized on many elements of law, and the new rules, including pressure for the Liberals to provide further proof of their allegations of foreign extremist funding, and evidence of other steps they'd taken to try and solve the various protests prior to bringing out what the Tories called a "sledgehammer."
The debate will continue throughout the weekend, with the vote scheduled for 8 p.m. Monday.

Full text: OTTAWA — Parliament Hill now exists in two different — and conflicting — realities.
In one, a dangerous group of unlawful protesters face an “imminent” crackdown as police flex their muscle and politicians warn of grave consequences for those who don’t leave now.
In the other: defiance, dancing and devotion to a cause that many in the remaining “Freedom Convoy” crowd see as a struggle between good and evil.
By late Thursday, police were patrolling the streets around Parliament Hill in greater numbers, issuing tickets to parked and idling vehicles, and had made several arrests.
Tamara Lich, a key convoy organizer who on Wednesday night suggested in an online video that her arrest was “inevitable,” was taken into custody by police Thursday evening according to images posted on social media. Another top organizer, Chris Barber, was also arrested several hours earlier, according to media reports that Ottawa police would not confirm.
After allowing a protest against COVID-19 vaccination mandates and public health restrictions to turn into a weeks-long occupation of the capital’s downtown, Ottawa police trumpeted a “hardened” stance on Thursday, armed with the special powers granted by the federal government’s invocation for the first time of the Emergencies Act.
Interim Ottawa police Chief Steve Bell announced Thursday afternoon that “action is imminent” as officers from his and other police forces set up a perimeter around Parliament Hill and established a secured zone across a wide swath of downtown streets.
Ottawa police said only people who live or work in businesses in the city’s downtown core will be allowed to go there.
Highway access into the city centre will also be restricted, with 100 police checkpoints scattered across the core to ensure additional protesters cannot descend on the capital for the fourth straight weekend of noisy and disruptive demonstrations.
“What I can tell you is that this weekend will look very different from the past three weekends,” Bell said.
The province passed emergency regulations last week that declared 400-series highways as critical infrastructure, and allow police extraordinary powers to secure traffic flow.
Many more security fences were erected around Parliament and served as the backdrop to a bitterly divisive debate on the Trudeau government’s declaration of a national “public order emergency.”
Lawmakers will continue debating the need for emergency powers almost around the clock until it comes to a vote on Monday. The Sergeant at Arms sent MPs a note saying a police action would be happening on Friday.
While the vote could revoke the federal emergency proclamation, the new police powers it grants to establish no-go zones and ban travel to and from “unlawful assemblies” are already in force.
Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair warned the protesters that the demonstration site was “no place for children.”
“Take them home immediately,” Blair said. “Take them to a safe place.”
Outside, among the trucks on Wellington Street, two men laughed and played with toy trucks in a small, inflatable hot tub filled with bubbling water — a sight that the former chair of Ottawa’s police board described in exasperation this week as a symbol of Ottawa’s “carnival of chaos.”
Elsewhere, protesters cooked food on a barbecue while parked transport trucks periodically erupted in bursts of honking. In front of the Prime Minister’s Office, a man played a tuba in a crowd of dancing protesters. Another man with a harmonica and guitar delivered a rendition of Bob Dylan’s “Blowin’ In the Wind” from a stage beneath a Canadian flag flapping from the end of a large crane.
Derek Barnett, who came to the protest on Thursday from Orangeville, was walking near the Prime Minister’s Office with his mother and her friend. Barnett wore a red baseball cap with the slogan, “Drain the Swamp!” — a phrase associated with former U.S. president Donald Trump that refers to alleged government corruption.
Barnett said he joined the protests because he wants all pandemic health restrictions lifted, and questioned whether the police warnings about imminent arrests were real.
He also slammed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for invoking the Emergencies Act to deal with what he believes to be a peaceful protest.
Asked whether he is willing to be arrested, Barnett said he would consider that a badge of honour.
“That would be my Purple Heart,” he said, referring to an American military award given to those injured or killed in combat. “I’m a casualty of war at that point … It does feel like ‘good versus evil.’”
At 1 p.m., a solid cacophony of horns and train whistles blasted in unison for several minutes. It was a show of support to mark the prayers of a group of Christian protesters who had been walking around Parliament Hill every afternoon for the past seven days — a reference, some demonstrators explained, to the Biblical story of how the Israelites marched around the walls of Jericho before God made them fall.
“The Lord is on our side. We don’t worry about it. I know Trudeau will come down too,” said John Jonker, who owns a trucking company in Guelph, Ont. and came to the protests with a fleet of his fellow drivers.
In his view, the protesters’ opposition to COVID-19 health restrictions is part of a “religious struggle” and he said he is convinced the “truth” of their cause will prevail, regardless of what police do.
Jonker said he was not worried about the police, expressing doubts that they would follow through on their threat to take action against the demonstrators.
“The police helped us get in here,” he said, referring to a deal made by Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson that allowed truckers to move onto the street in front of Parliament from the residential streets where they initially parked.
Jonker also dismissed any concerns about warnings that the federal government could freeze assets such as his trucking company and personal bank accounts.
“We’re not worried about that. You know why? They took our jobs away” — referring to the federal quarantine requirement for unvaccinated truckers crossing the Canada-U. S. border — “so our bank accounts are empty anyway.
“So what can they freeze? As long as we are honest, as long as we really speak the truth, we tell the truth, then we don’t worry about it at all. They may take everything away.”
A citizens’ effort to oust the occupation also continued Thursday, with a class-action lawsuit expanded to include a number of individual protesters who publicly spoke out over the past three weeks, and 62 unnamed participants, identified as John or Jane Doe.
The lawsuit is seeking $306 million in damages, as well as legal costs.
Meanwhile, the federal government tried to make its case in the House of Commons for why it is necessary to resort to exceptional emergency powers to end the protest.
It presented documents accompanying the motion to support the emergency declaration that said the “situation across the country remains concerning, volatile and unpredictable.”
For the first time, the government said, “threats were also made to block railway lines, which would result in significant disruptions” to trade corridors that carry $310 billion in goods each year.
While border blockades had been cleared and traffic had resumed at Coutts, Alberta, and Emerson, Manitoba, the government signalled the overall threat has not ended, and that democratic institutions in Canada were under attack.
“The protests have become a rallying point for anti-government and anti-authority, anti-vaccination, conspiracy theory and white supremacist groups throughout Canada and other Western countries. The protesters have varying ideological grievances, with demands ranging from an end to all public health restrictions to the overthrow of the elected government,” the documents said.
Describing the chaos in Ottawa, it cited the resignation of Ottawa Police chief Peter Sloly “in response to criticism of the police’s response to the protests.”
Several premiers opposed the use of the Emergencies Act within their territories, including Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Quebec. New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and PEI have said they don’t believe their provinces require it. Others like Ontario and Newfoundland and Labrador supported the federal government’s response.
Trudeau again emphasized in his speech to the House of Commons on Thursday morning that the powers are both time-limited and targeted to certain regions.
While the Conservatives and Bloc Québécois oppose the move by Trudeau’s minority government, it has the support of the New Democrats, with NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh pointing to the convoy organizer’s stated goal of overthrowing the government.

Full text: A B.C. gun range owner, a twice-bankrupt charity founder from Durham Region, a Donald Trump fan who owns a national chain of industrial cleaning warehouses and a former lawyer who now operates a popular lodge in Killarney are among the top five Canadian donors to the Ottawa “ Freedom Convoy. ”
Together, these five have donated more than $225,000 to the protesters who have occupied parts of downtown Ottawa for more than two weeks. They used the online platform GiveSendGo, which had its donor list leaked after being hacked last weekend.
The Star obtained the hacked donor data from the online whistleblower DDoSecrets, a website that hosts leaked data. The Star has independently confirmed the identities of many of the top donors.
In total, more than $10.7 million was donated through the GiveSendGo campaign, which said it was for food, fuel and shelter for the protesters. Of that total, $5.5 million came from Canadian sources. The bulk of the remaining money, some 40 per cent of the $10.7 million, was donated by Americans. (All donations were made in American funds.)
More than 36,000 Canadian donated, the vast majority in sums of $126 (that is, $100 US) or less. There were a small number of large donations. Eight people gave $12,691 or more.
Trevor Farrow, a professor at the Osgoode Hall Law School at York University, said crowdfunding has become an essential tool for many social movements and protest groups that otherwise have no access to the money needed to pay for things such as legal advice.
As part of the invoking of the Emergencies Act, the federal government is now requiring websites such as GiveSendGo to report more information to authorities investigating the protest.
Farrow said the federal government is understandably examining how the protests are being funded. However, he cautioned that using a hammer instead of scalpel when regulating crowdfunding could have a detrimental impact on legitimate protest movements.
Brad Howland
The single largest Canadian donor to the campaigns was Brad Howland, 54, the owner of Easy Kleen Pressure Systems, a large power-washing company in Sussex Corner, N.B. The company also has offices in Edmonton and Red Deer, Alta., as well as in Cambridge and Concord, Ont.
Howland donated about $95,000 to the GiveSendGo campaign, writing “HOLD THE LINE!!!” in the comments.
An unabashed fan of former U.S. president Donald Trump, Howland has posted photos of himself on social media wearing a Trump baseball cap. The profile photo on his Facebook page is of Howland standing at a replica of the lectern at the White House press room beside a cardboard cutout of Trump.
Howland declined to be interviewed for this story. However, in a statement posted to the Easy Kleen website, he said he donated in part because so many truckers have used his company’s services and “how the government and the media portray them is not true.”
While the protest-turned-occupation are not representative of the trucking industry — some 90 per cent of Canadian truckers are vaccinated and working — Howland states he believes he is supporting them in their time of need.
“We thank them when we can, but rarely get to support them when they are in need, and they are in need right NOW,” wrote Howland. “We drove to Ottawa and witnessed the protest for ourselves. They have a beautiful, legal peaceful protest that overwhelmed us with emotion.”
From 2008 until 2021, Easy Kleen was awarded more than $92,000 in federal contracts. The last contract was a 2021 deal with Parks Canada for more than $13,000 in parts and equipment, according to federal records.
According to federal government records, the company also received money under the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy to offset pandemic losses in revenue. The records do not show how much money the company received.
Anonymous
The GiveSendGo data shows that a donation of more than $50,000 was made by a person who entered a postal code from Coldwater, Ont. However, the Star has not been able to reach this person or confirm their identity. The fundraising data shows this person made two donations of about $25,000, the first on Feb. 5 and the second on Feb 6.
Holden Rhodes
Ex-lawyer Holden Rhodes, who made a fortune when his car history company was sold for $650 million in 2015, is the source of the third largest Canadian donation on the list.
The owner of several outdoor resorts on Georgian Bay, including The Sportsman Inn and the Killarney Mountain Lodge , donated about $31,000.
Rhodes, 55, added a comment to his donation: “Freedom first. All else follows.”
Contacted by the Star, Rhodes defended the “Freedom Convoy” against the negative characterizations made by politicians and the media.
The protest “is hardly a ‘fringe minority’ as our prime minister has been calling the folks who believe in freedom,” Rhodes wrote in an email. “While there have (been) a few large donations like mine and larger, most of the donations are smaller showing the magnitude and breadth of the people financially supporting this movement.”
“While it started as a protest to the Jan 15 federal requirement that truckers had to prove vaccination when crossing the CDN/US border … the movement has exponentially grown and at the core it is about freedom,” he wrote. “As of today, 90% of all eligible Ontarians are double vaccinated — what more does the government want?”
“The overreach on the last two years has been astounding, but in the last two weeks in Canada it has been absolutely alarming for anyone believes in a peaceful and free society,” wrote Rhodes. “Freedom is rightfully restricted by reasonable laws that have at their core protections that are framed by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. I am not prepared to accept a country without freedom for my family, my children, my friends, my neighbours and every other Canadian. That is why I am doing what I am doing.”
Rhodes has made several political donations in recent years, both to the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario. In 2017, he donated $1,200 to the provincial London North-Centre PC riding association. In 2016, he donated $500 to the PC Party of Ontario.
David Slabodkin
David Slabodkin, a philanthropist and former insurance executive who was found by a judge to have cheated an elderly woman out of her house decades ago, made a donation of over $25,000.
Slabodkin, 64, now lives in Cannington, Ont., just southeast of Lake Simcoe, where he has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to local charities and founded one of his own, through a trust fund set up in his name.
The Nourish and Develop Foundation runs a food bank, women’s shelter and community garden as part of its anti-poverty work in Cannington. In a statement posted to its website, the organization said Slabodkin made the convoy donation with “personal funds” and it “is not connected in any way to TNDF values or operations.”
Slabodkin did not respond to emails or messages from the Star.
Provincial records show he has donated to all three political parties. In 2018, he gave a total of $3,666 to the provincial NDP, its Sudbury riding association and now-MPP Jamie West. The same year, he gave $1,222 to the Haliburton-Kawartha Lakes-Brock PC Riding Association and another $1,222 to PC candidate and now-MPP Laurie Scott. In 2017, he gave $1,200 to the Ontario Liberal party.
In 2017, Slabodkin sent $30,000 to Wapekeka First Nation in northern Ontario after hearing about the deaths by suicide of two 12-year-old girls. He later pledged $380,000 for a suicide-prevention plan, but revoked the donation after learning that the federal government would fund the project, according to the CBC.
Prior to starting his own insurance business, Canada Protection Plan (which he has now sold), Slabodkin appeared to have had a more difficult time with money. In the 1980s, while working as a contractor, he declared bankruptcy. Several years later, he was sued by an 88-year-old woman after her granddaughter found her forged signature on a sales document that transferred her house to Slabodkin.
He testified that he had brought her $175,000 in cash in a paper bag before she signed over the Toronto house. Slabodkin later took out a $150,000 mortgage on the property in Lawrence Park.
A judge ruled that it was impossible to believe that Slabodkin paid the “confused” woman who “could only read with the assistance of an illuminated magnifying glass and who was hard of hearing.”
A judge reversed the sale of the house to Slabodkin and ordered him to pay the mortgage provider $191,000. A year after the judgment, Slabodkin declared bankruptcy again, with $569,400 in debts.
Dustin Sikora
Dustin Sikora, the 40-year-old owner of an indoor shooting range in Langley, B.C., donated about $23,000.
Sikora posted his business’s name — The Range Langley — with his donation, adding a quote attributed to Benjamin Franklin: “Those who would give up essential liberty, to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.”
Sikora did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
The range’s website states that it is “owned and operated by active and retired Canadian military and law enforcement.” The Department of Defence was unable to confirm whether Sikora had served with Canada’s military before deadline.
Earlier this week, a statement on the donation was posted to the website.
“Our donation to the Freedom Convoy 2022 is our way of peacefully participating in democracy. For whatever reason, some may disagree with our beliefs and support for this cause. That is their Right. We will always defend the Rights of those that disagree with us,” it read. “We warn all Canadians to be aware of anyone that accuses their dissenters as being ‘dangerous’ and use such labels as justification to take their Right to peaceful protest away.”
Correction — Feb. 17, 2022: This article was edited to correct that Holden Rhodes is owner of the Killarney Mountain Lodge. A previous version stated it was the Killarney Lodge.

Full text: For the first time as premier, Doug Ford has publicly acknowledged the personal family matter that has long been public knowledge.
In fact, he raised it himself — not in answer to a reporter’s question, more in reply to his own daughter’s public questioning.
Reading from a teleprompter, Ford talked about the latest anti-government protests in Windsor and Ottawa. Then he raised his own family strife closer to home.
The premier never mentioned Krista Ford Haynes by name, but he sent a message to his adult daughter all the same.
“One of the hardest things about this pandemic is the way it’s fractured us as a society,” he said at a Monday news conference .
“I’ve experienced this in my own family. It’s been one of the hardest things my family and I have ever gone through.”
Speaking the next day, Ford even had trouble getting out the word “family” when describing the impact, briefly choking up in front of reporters: “Man it’s challenging, especially on the fam... on the family side.”
The public taunting by the 30-year-old daughter of Ontario’s 26th premier is an old story, long circulating on social media where she posts anti-vax, anti-lockdown messages that accuse those in authority — that would be her father — of overreacting to what she views as an overstated risk of COVID-19 and an underrated danger of vaccines.
Her early musings were picked up by small media outlets, but as she has become evermore vocal, the story has creeped into coverage by major publications.
The Star and the Globe and Mail wrote about her antics late last year, when the attacks escalated after her husband Dave Haynes was put on unpaid leave by the Toronto police for refusing to disclose his vaccination status. In one post, she poses on her exercise bicycle for the camera, pedalling and perspiring while peddling conspiracy theories and denouncing evildoers.
It is uncomfortable viewing for the leader of the province.
“I do believe the people behind all of this will be held accountable — don’t know when, but I truly believe God wins,” she says into the camera. “Evil does not win.”
Along the way, she has capitalized on the attention she gets from the Ford family name. At one public protest, she was advertised as “Krista Haynes, family of the premier Doug Ford.”
More recently, she has publicly supported the anti-government protests and posted a photo of herself on Instagram holding a Canadian flag scrawled with the words, “F - - - Trudeau.”
If you want to see for yourself, you can search for yourself online. But that hasn’t stopped those who follow such matters from accusing the mass media of protecting the premier and his family from public ridicule by somehow suppressing the details.
In truth, I haven’t written about it until now because I’ve never believed the sins of the father should be visited upon the son — or daughter. Nor should the online spin of the progeny be visited upon the premier.
There’s also a logical contradiction: If she keeps complaining that the father isn’t abiding by her views, then it’s hard to accuse the premier of being under her influence, let alone prone to a conflict of interest.
In any case, the premier did distance herself from his eldest daughter in December by pointedly avoiding the customary family photo with all four daughters in his annual Christmas card. As the Star’s Robert Benzie wrote at the time , the omission and the situation were “personally painful” to him.
While the premier has not denounced her, he has pointedly bounced other members of his wider political family — Progressive Conservative MPPs and staff — for contradicting government policy: on Tuesday, his government parted ways with a senior member of the solicitor general’s political staff over a $100 donation to the convoy protest; previously, Ford’s Tories expelled MPP Rick Nicholls from caucus for refusing to get vaccinated, and Belinda Karahalios for opposing pandemic restrictions.
Asked for comment about the father-daughter conflict, the premier’s office said his public statement speaks for itself. Also, “his actions speak for themselves.”
But at a certain point, I believe readers deserve to understand the background references in a public conversation, notably when the premier talks about it at a public event.
All that said, many a Ford critic has insisted in emails and tweets that too much has been left unsaid. They argue that the public has a right to know precisely how the premier has been influenced by his adult daughter in the pandemic decision-making process.
Whatever one thinks of Ford’s policies and politics, they do not line up with his daughter’s posts. Even if he has been personally affected by the dispute, there are no signs he has been deflected off course by her arguments.
The premier is not the first political leader to wrestle with the balance between publicity and privacy. They all walk a fine line — one moment trotting out family for platitudes and photo-ops, years later retreating to expectations of privacy.
One Christmas it’s a family photo. The next Christmas the daughters are out of the picture.
For whatever reason — perhaps trying to get the story out there and behind him with an election campaign looming, or possibly just to get it off his chest — Ford has opened the door and, in his own way, invited Ontarians to once again peer into the family’s internal tensions. Now that we know more about what the father thinks of his eldest daughter’s thoughts, back to the bigger question of where the premier is taking the province.
If Ford the elder falls short on COVID-19 or other measures, it surely has more to do with his own shortcomings than those of his eldest daughter.

'Proceed with extreme caution': Conservatives send warning as Emergencies Act debate begins

Full text: OTTAWA — The political division over the use of the federal Emergencies Act became as solidly entrenched as the concrete blocks now ringing Parliament Hill as debate over the unprecedented use of the law began Thursday in the House of Commons.
Where the Liberals argued threats to national security are so severe as to require time-limited but sweeping new powers for police and other authorities, the Conservatives saw a national unity crisis being fanned by the prime minister himself.
Using the act to create new rules and regulations aimed at ending a three-week-long occupation of the national capital is an erosion of the rights and freedoms of Canadians and a complete overreach, the Conservatives said Thursday.
“This is not a game,” said interim Conservative Leader Candice Bergen as she laid out the reasons her party won’t support the declaration of a public order emergency.
“It comes at the cost to Canadians’ rights and freedoms,” she said. “Parliament should not allow the prime minister to avoid responsibility in this way. I urge all members of this House, proceed with extreme caution.”
But the Conservatives’ own position did not escape attacks from the Liberals or the NDP, who continued to point out that many MPs have vocally supported the so-called Freedom Convoy in recent weeks, even as its rhetoric and harassment of local residents heated up.
A truck parked just across the street from the House of Commons bears a flag calling for Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre to become the next prime minister. Poilievre is so far the only candidate in the race to become his party’s next leader.
What MPs will vote on specifically is a motion confirming a declaration of a public order emergency, a requirement of the Emergencies Act that was invoked by the government on Monday night.
With it came a slew of new policing and other powers to cut off and criminalize sources of funding for the protesters, as well as the ability for people to join in further protests and blockades.
Liberals insist that the Charter of Rights will be upheld and peaceful protests will be allowed to continue, but say the economic and social threats posed by the “Freedom Convoy” demonstrators must come to an end.
“We are not limiting people’s freedom of expression. We are not limiting freedom of peaceful assembly. We are not preventing people from exercising their right to protest legally. We are, in fact, reinforcing the principles, values and institutions that keep all Canadians free,” Trudeau said.
If MPs fail to vote in favour of the declaration, it would be revoked immediately.
For now, the New Democrats are on side, although Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet — who opposes the declaration — said he was going to talk to NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh to see if they could reach a “mutual understanding.”
The Bloc opposes the emergency declaration on the grounds that it steps too far into Quebec’s jurisdiction, and that the border blockades in Alberta and Windsor that have been used in part to justify its invocation were cleared without using any of the extra powers provided by the act.
The government could have found a strategy somewhere “between playing Pontius Pilate and attacking with the atomic bomb,” Bloc MP Alain Therrien said at one point during the debate.
Singh has been pressed to defend his support of invoking the act by the Tories and BQ. They noted that then-NDP leader Tommy Douglas had opposed the use of the War Measures Act — the precursor to the Emergencies Act — in 1970, when prime minister Pierre Trudeau invoked it in response to the kidnapping and eventual murder of Quebec’s deputy premier.
Singh said that while what’s happening in the streets of Ottawa goes beyond a peaceful protest, questions must be asked about the failure of local police to solve the problem — and why it appeared some may even be in support of the demonstrations.
“Occupiers get hugs from the police, while Indigenous and racialized protesters are met with the barrel of a gun,” he said.
The daylong debate seized on many elements of law, and the new rules, including pressure for the Liberals to provide further proof of their allegations of foreign extremist funding, and evidence of other steps they’d taken to try and solve the various protests prior to bringing out what the Tories called a “sledgehammer.”
The debate will continue throughout the weekend, with the vote scheduled for 8 p.m. Monday.

Full text: A billion for re-election, Feb. 10
This shameless intent of vote-buying by Doug Ford is reminiscent of when Jean Chrétien came to power federally, with the promise to scrap the hated GST; but, Chrétien had added as a qualifier: “I need the money.”
So the politicians just get the same money, or more, elsewhere, from the beleaguered taxpayer.
What a shameful distortion of democracy!
If his scheme carries the day (election), we certainly won’t be any better of, be it financially or politically.

Full text: It's in the fine print.
Premier Doug Ford's Progressive Conservatives insist they have already kept their cornerstone campaign pledge to lower electricity bills by 12 per cent - even though rates have risen.
That revelation is buried in a new 22-page report on hydro subsidies by the Financial Accountability Office released Wednesday at Queen's Park.
"The FAO spoke with staff at the Ministry of Energy and was informed that the government does not intend to lower electricity bills by 12 per cent from 2018 levels," the independent watchdog said.
"Instead, the government intends to meet its commitment to lower residential electricity bills by 12 per cent by comparing residential electricity bills under the current electricity subsidy programs against what electricity bills would have been under the electricity subsidy programs from 2017," it continued.
That means the Progressive Conservatives are using as a benchmark the previous Liberal government's Fair Hydro Plan projections of where rates were headed.
Energy Minister Todd Smith insisted the FAO "confirmed today that electricity bills will be 12 per cent lower than they would have been under the previous government's disastrous plan."
"What's more, the report also shows that electricity bills will be 23 per cent lower in 2029 because of the action our government has taken to get Ontario back on track after years of Liberal mismanagement, representing billions of dollars in savings for Ontarians," Smith said.
With a provincial election 15 weeks away, the Tories are mindful that rising hydro rates played a significant role in their toppling of former premier Kathleen Wynne's Liberals in 2018. In that campaign, Ford promised to cut prices by 12 per cent.
The FAO estimated that taxpayers will fork over about $118.1 billion over 20 years - from 2020-21 to 2039-40 - on electricity subsidies for households and businesses.
Already a $6.9 billion a year hit to the treasury, the annual price tag will "gradually fall to $4.2 billion in 2039-40, a 40 per cent decline in the programs' annual cost."
Two years ago, the subsidies were costing the treasury $5.6 billion.
NDP MPP Peter Tabuns (Toronto Danforth) said the report is an indictment of both the Tories and the Liberals.
"The FAO makes it clear that the scheme Ford put forward was always magic beans, smoke and mirrors and a shell game. It was built to be a facade, not to lower hydro bills," Tabuns said.
Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca said the FAO findings prove "Doug Ford lied" when he promised in 2018 to reduce hydro rates by 12 per cent.
"I suspect he knew he was lying in that moment in 2018. Doug Ford ... has taken a tough situation and made it dramatically worse," the Liberal leader said.
Green Leader Mike Schreiner said the subsidy programs is "wasteful and unfair."
"Programs should be targeted to those who need the relief the most - lower income individuals and families and people in rural areas and on First Nations reserves."

Full text: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused Conservatives Wednesday of standing "with people who wave swastikas" as his government began to face intense scrutiny over its historic invocation of the Emergencies Act.
The Liberals have declared the so-called "Freedom Convoy" a national threat so severe that new rules and laws are needed, but it was only Wednesday that MPs began digesting the details and tension and mayhem ran high in the House.
After emerging from their respective weekly caucus meetings Wednesday, the opposition parties wasted little time blasting the Liberals during question period for what they described as actions representing a massive overreach, unnecessary and a double-standard, considering all the past protests and events that didn't merit the same response.
Many Conservatives also hold Trudeau personally responsible for the demonstrations, arguing his decision to make vaccines a political issue that has divided the country.
Conservative MP Melissa Lantsman (Thornhill) slammed Trudeau Wednesday, juxtaposing his optimism after his election in 2015 with his negative characterization of some of those who protest against him as racist and misogynistic. In his response to Lantsman, who is Jewish, Trudeau said, "Conservative party members can stand with people who wave swastikas, they can stand with people who wave the Confederate flag."
"We will choose to stand with Canadians who deserve to be able to get to their jobs, to be able to get their lives back."
Furious shouting erupted, prompting the Speaker to intervene yet again in the debate and remind MPs and the prime minister to use words that aren't inflammatory in the Commons.
Conservative MPs later demanded Trudeau apologize, but he deflected those calls and reiterated his criticisms of Conservative support for the protests and his defence of the use of the act.
After question period, Lantsman rose to demand an apology.
"I am a strong Jewish woman, and a member of this House, and a descendent of Holocaust survivors," she said, her voice breaking.
"It's never been singled out and I've never been made to feel less except for today when the prime minister accused me of standing with swastikas." Minutes later, Liberal cabinet minister Karina Gould (Burlington) rose as well to point out she, too, is a proud Jewish woman, who is also descended from Holocaust survivors.
She asked her colleagues across the aisle to think harder before they lend their support to the convoy.
"How does it feel as a person in the House seeing colleagues taking pictures with people who are looking to overthrow the government?"
The Liberals argue local law enforcement needed additional powers found in the act to end illegal blockades and restore the flow of people and commerce both across borders and in downtown Ottawa.
Numerous Conservative MPs were supportive of the convoy in the early days, though as signs of racism emerged in the crowd denounced it.
Conservative Interim Leader Candice Bergen said she's now trying to send truckers a different message. "We believe that the government should present a plan to end the vaccines and the mandates, but you need to move your truck," she said Wednesday.
The Conservatives and Bloc Québécois say they won't support the act, while the NDP have offered tepid support.

Full text: Should we really scrap vaccination passports now?
Ontario reconsiders COVID timeline, Feb. 11
Doug Ford should not be so quick to lift vaccine passports. To do so in the context of continuing illegal blockades would be seen as capitulating to angry mobs. And, it would reward all the selfish people who refused to do the responsible thing and get vaccinated.
The majority of Ontarians have supported the government, the hospital system and their fellow citizens by getting the vaccine.
It continues to be important for those of us who are vaccinated to know who we are sharing space with, who we are sitting beside in restaurants, theatres, sporting events, and so on.
This is a safety and comfort level that we deserve.
Annabel Maguire, Adjala Township, Ont.
Biden should repatriate frozen Afghan funds
Ex-Afghan president: Biden order on frozen funds an atrocity, Feb. 13
I write to endorse former president Hamid Karzai's call to unfreeze Afghan funds, now held in the U.S., and to send all of these funds to the Afghan people, but to do so through reputable international humanitarian channels, exclusively for the use of Afghanistan's people.
The withholding of $3.5 billion, potentially to address lawsuits of some groups of 9/11 family members, is regrettable.
As a Canadian 9/11 widow who is not a party to these lawsuits, I concur with the view that the losses of these decades of war are shared. The good course of action now is to release all the frozen Afghan funds for the Afghan people and to repair the wounds of war.
Ellen Judd, Winnipeg
Politicians fail to protect us from gun violence
High school shooting was an 'execution,' police say, Feb. 16; Sandy Hook families settle with gun maker, Feb. 16
Whenever I read the too-late analyses of such tragedies, I think of a T-shirt I saw that read, "Somebody should do something." Guns are overproduced, wantonly marketed by amoral gun companies like Remington, and are plentiful and cheap on the street. They are smuggled in from the gun-crazy U.S., and sold by, or burglarized from, legal gun owners.
While I agree with criminologist Kanika Samuels-Wortley's shopping list for what needs to be done, why does she not place tight gun control at the top of it?
Maybe it's because she knows that's not going to happen, because our prime minister has been anemic about it, and premiers like Doug Ford, Jason Kenney and Scott Moe rely on the votes and donations of the gun lobby and gun owners.
It's no accident that in gun-lax Alberta, men on the fringe were able to assemble a huge and deadly arsenal of weapons.
Why follow the Americans over that lemming cliff?
Let's send a Canadian-style message to the gun companies: "We don't need or want your toxic, deadly products."
Ron Charach, Toronto
Ford's shell game with stickers fools no one
A billion for re-election, Feb. 10
This shameless vote-buying by Doug Ford is reminiscent of when Jean Chrétien came to power federally, with the promise to scrap the hated GST; but, Chrétien had added as a qualifier: "I need the money."
So the politicians just get the same money, or more, elsewhere, from the beleaguered taxpayer. If his scheme carries the day (election), we certainly won't be any better of, be it financially or politically.

Full text: It’s in the fine print.
Premier Doug Ford ’s Progressive Conservatives insist they have already kept their cornerstone campaign pledge to lower electricity bills by 12 per cent — even though rates have risen.
That revelation is buried in a new 22-page report on hydro subsidies by the Financial Accountability Office released Wednesday at Queen’s Park.
“The FAO spoke with staff at the Ministry of Energy and was informed that the government does not intend to lower electricity bills by 12 per cent from 2018 levels,” the independent watchdog said.
“Instead, the government intends to meet its commitment to lower residential electricity bills by 12 per cent by comparing residential electricity bills under the current electricity subsidy programs against what electricity bills would have been under the electricity subsidy programs from 2017,” it continued.
That means the Progressive Conservatives are using as a benchmark the previous Liberal government’s Fair Hydro Plan projections of where rates were headed.
Energy Minister Todd Smith insisted the FAO “confirmed today that electricity bills will be 12 per cent lower than they would have been under the previous government’s disastrous plan.”
“What’s more, the report also shows that electricity bills will be 23 per cent lower in 2029 because of the action our government has taken to get Ontario back on track after years of Liberal mismanagement, representing billions of dollars in savings for Ontarians,” said Smith.
“The FAO report confirms what Ontarians have known for years — the failed policies of the former Liberal government resulted in skyrocketing hydro rates. Under the Liberal plan, electricity bills for Ontario families and businesses would have increased by six per cent every year until 2028.”
With a provincial election 15 weeks away, the Tories are mindful that rising hydro rates played a significant role in their toppling of former premier Kathleen Wynne’s Liberals in 2018.
In that campaign, Ford promised to cut prices by 12 per cent.
The FAO estimated that taxpayers will fork over about $118.1 billion over 20 years — from 2020-21 to 2039-40 — on electricity subsidies for households and businesses.
Already a $6.9 billion a year hit to the treasury, the annual price tag will “gradually fall to $4.2 billion in 2039-40, a 40 per cent decline in the programs’ annual cost.”
“The government has informed the FAO that it intends to meet its commitment to reduce residential electricity bills by 12 per cent by comparing electricity bills under the current subsidy programs against what electricity bills would have been under the (Liberals).”
From 2018 to 2021, a typical residential electricity bill rose by 4.3 per cent.
Two years ago, the subsidies were costing the treasury $5.6 billion.

Full text: The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Wednesday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available .
7:37 p.m.: Social isolation, economic stress, loss of loved ones and other struggles during the pandemic have contributed to rising mental health issues like anxiety and depression.
But can having COVID-19 increase the risk of developing mental health problems? A large new study suggests it can.
The study, published Wednesday in the journal The BMJ, analyzed records of nearly 154,000 COVID patients in the Veterans Health Administration system and compared their experience in the year after they recovered from their initial infection with that of a similar group of people who did not contract the virus.
The study included only patients who had no mental health diagnoses or treatment for at least two years before becoming infected with the coronavirus, allowing researchers to focus on psychiatric diagnoses and treatment that occurred after coronavirus infection.
People who had COVID were 39 per cent more likely to be diagnosed with depression and 35 per cent more likely to be diagnosed with anxiety over the months following infection than people without COVID during the same period, the study found. COVID patients were 38 per cent more likely to be diagnosed with stress and adjustment disorders and 41 per cent more likely to be diagnosed with sleep disorders than uninfected people.
“There appears to be a clear excess of mental health diagnoses in the months after COVID,” said Paul Harrison, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the study. He said the results echoed the emerging picture from other research, including a 2021 study on which he was an author.
The data does not suggest that most COVID patients will develop mental health symptoms. Only between 4.4 per cent and 5.6 per cent of those in the study received diagnoses of depression, anxiety or stress and adjustment disorders.
“It’s not an epidemic of anxiety and depression, fortunately,” Harrison said. “But it’s not trivial.”
Researchers also found that COVID patients were 80 per cent more likely to develop cognitive problems like brain fog, confusion and forgetfulness than those who didn’t have COVID.
7:11 p.m.: British children ages 5 to 11, one of the last remaining groups in the country still broadly ineligible for the coronavirus vaccine, will be offered doses under new guidance announced Wednesday by Britain’s independent vaccine advisory committee. Sajid Javid, England’s health secretary, said in a...
British children ages 5 to 11, one of the last remaining groups in the country still broadly ineligible for the coronavirus vaccine, will be offered doses under new guidance announced Wednesday by Britain’s independent vaccine advisory committee.
Sajid Javid, England’s health secretary, said in a statement that the National Health Service would begin to offer vaccine doses to children in that age range in April. Scotland and Wales, which have their own health systems, also announced plans Wednesday to begin vaccinating children ages 5 to 11.
Medically vulnerable children in that age group are already being vaccinated in Britain, following guidance the committee issued in December.
Javid said the intention of the broader policy was to allow parents the opportunity “to increase protection against potential future waves of COVID-19 as we learn to live with this virus.”
Britain has been slower than many other European nations or the United States to extend vaccine eligibility to younger children. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration did so for children ages 5 to 11 in October.
In Britain, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization said Wednesday that the children should be offered two pediatric doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, spaced 12 weeks apart. For adults, the initial doses of the vaccine are larger and are generally given four weeks apart.
Professor Wei Shen Lim, who leads the committee’s coronavirus program, said the scientific advisers had “carefully considered the potential direct health impacts of vaccination and potential indirect educational impacts” of protecting children against severe illness.
6:59 p.m.: British Columbia’s education minister says capacity at school-based events will be capped at 50 per cent for spectators to provide some physical distancing because proof of vaccination will not be required.
Jennifer Whiteside says the measure is in contrast to the lifting of capacity limits starting at midnight for community-based gatherings, where COVID-19 vaccine passports must still be shown.
Whiteside says the capacity cap applies to extracurricular events, whether they are on or off school property, and marks a return to the rules that were in effect last fall.
Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has declared school-based activities an essential service, so visitors do not need to present a vaccine passport.
Meanwhile, Health Minister Adrian Dix says about two-thirds of all non-urgent cancelled surgeries in the province are in the Interior Health region.
He says the proportion of health-care workers calling in sick is higher in that region, so there are some challenges in clearing backlogs.
“But most everywhere else, we’re going to be aggressively moving to rebook surgeries in the coming weeks because people need their surgeries. And even if we describe these as non-urgent scheduled surgeries, they’re all important, they’re all necessary,” he says.
6:37 p.m.: Florida reported 6,458 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday as the seven-day average dropped to its lowest level in two months, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.
The number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients also continued to decline, falling to 5,188 on Tuesday, down 27 per cent in a week and 56 per cent from its peak, data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services shows.
There were 845 COVID-infected patients in intensive care units on Tuesday, a one-week drop of 24 per cent. The hospital data combines patients admitted for COVID-19 with those admitted for reasons other than COVID-19 or who were infected after admission.
The testing positivity rate in Miami-Dade County dropped to 9.2 per cent on Tuesday and was just slightly above 10 per cent in Broward County. Three other counties in Florida — Volusia, Monroe and Flagler — also have positive rates in the single digits.
Vaccinations in Florida have gone nearly stagnant over the past two weeks with just 22,987 shots being given per day on average, a 63.8 per cent decrease from this time last month. About 65.6 per cent of Floridians are fully vaccinated and 37.9 per cent have had their booster shots.
To date, there have been 5,763,580 known cases of COVID-19 in Florida and at least 67,914 residents have died.
5:43 p.m.: The nation’s leading health officials said Wednesday that the U.S. is moving closer to the point that COVID-19 is no longer a “constant crisis” as more cities, businesses and sports venues began lifting pandemic restrictions around the country.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said during a White House briefing that the government is contemplating a change to its mask guidance in the coming weeks. Noting recent declines in COVID-19 cases, hospital admissions and deaths, she acknowledged “people are so eager” for health officials to ease masking rules and other measures designed to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
“We all share the same goal – to get to a point where COVID-19 is no longer disrupting our daily lives, a time when it won’t be a constant crisis – rather something we can prevent, protect against, and treat,” Walensky said.
With the omicron variant waning and Americans eager to move beyond the virus, government and business leaders have been out ahead of the CDC in ending virus measures in the last week, including ordering workers back to offices, eliminating mask mandates and no longer requiring proof of vaccine to get into restaurants, bars and sports and entertainment arenas.
The efforts have been gaining more steam each day.
5:37 p.m.: Quebec will no longer require people who live in seniors residences and long-term care homes to isolate for 10 days if another resident or a worker on their floor tests positive for COVID-19.
The preventive isolation policy had been criticized by family members who said their relatives’ health declined during the isolation period.
Dr. Luc Boileau, Quebec’s interim public health director, told reporters Wednesday that residents will only have to isolate if they are in contact with someone who later tests positive for COVID-19 for more than 10 minutes without a mask. That isolation period will last five days.
“When I hear that sometimes autonomous people can’t leave their apartment for 10 days, even though they’ve been vaccinated three times and don’t have COVID, that’s not normal,” Seniors Minister Marguerite Blais said.
The change, which came into effect Wednesday, is one of several announced by Blais as the government looks to reduce restrictions in residential care facilities.
Blais said Quebec will also lift restrictions on the number of visitors residents can have by the end of the month and service providers, such as hair dressers, will once again be allowed in residential care facilities.
“I’d like us to stop being overcautious. We’re very, very careful that our older people don’t catch Omicron, catch a virus, and sometimes we’re too careful with regard to these people,” Blais said.
Joanne Béland, whose 84-year-old mother had to isolate for 10 days, despite testing negative twice during the isolation period, said the removal of the measure is “excellent news.” Béland said her mother’s health declined during the isolation period and she doesn’t expect her to ever recover from having to stay in her room for 10 days.
Boileau said the loosening of measures is possible because the current wave of the pandemic in the province is subsiding.
4:40 p.m.: Nova Scotia’s government on Wednesday said it would offer one-time grants of $875 to thousands of post-secondary students to help them pay their bills during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The government said about 11,000 students qualify for the $9.8-million grant program. Eligible students must be Nova Scotia residents, be already receiving financial assistance from the province for school, and be enrolled in a university, at Nova Scotia Community College or in a private career college.
Advanced Education Minister Brian Wong said in a news release many students haven’t been able to find part-time work during the pandemic to help pay for school. Students do not have to apply for the grant and won’t have to repay it.
The grant money will be automatically deposited into eligible students’ bank accounts in March.
Meanwhile, health officials reported three more deaths attributed to the novel coronavirus on Wednesday. They said a woman in her 50s, a woman in her 60s and a man in his 70s died between Feb. 6 and Feb. 12.
Officials also reported four new COVID-19 hospitalizations and nine discharges. They said 66 people were in hospital due to COVID-19 receiving care in a specialized unit.
Officials said two other groups of people were also in hospital with the disease: 131 people who were admitted for other reasons and tested positive upon arrival, and 164 people who contracted the virus while in hospital.
4:25 p.m.: President Joe Biden is hoping to use his upcoming State of the Union address to nudge the pandemic into the nation’s rear-view mirror. But it could turn into yet another disruptive display of national tensions and frustration over trying to move past COVID-19.
Biden’s March 1 address to Congress will play out against what Vice President Kamala Harris has called a “malaise” over the persistence of COVID and growing public impatience to get back to normal after two full years of pandemic restrictions.
The setting — Capitol Hill — remains one of the most significantly disrupted workplaces in the country, something of a ground zero for culture wars over the lingering restrictions.
Proxy voting in the House allows lawmakers to skip going into the office and has been extended through March. Tours and office visits are limited. GOP lawmakers have racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating mask-wearing mandates on the House floor.
Seating for Biden’s first address to a joint session of Congress last April was capped at about 200 — about 20 per cent of usual capacity for a presidential presentation. White House officials say the protocols for Biden’s next one will be determined by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Pelosi indicated last week that lawmakers are aiming for “fuller participation” than last year, including inviting every member of Congress. She said, “I think the people are ready to pivot in a way that shows to the American people we largely have been vaccinated here.”
But attendance, she added, will be “up to the Capitol physician.”
4:10 p.m.: The advocate for seniors in British Columbia says a rise in volunteer services supporting the elderly has been one of the “brightest lights” throughout the pandemic.
Isobel Mackenzie says nearly 26,000 seniors benefited from the generosity of over 13,000 volunteers as part of a provincially funded program that was expanded in March 2020 to boost services through community organizations.
Mackenzie says the number of seniors living independently and getting help with everything from the delivery of groceries to visits and snow shovelling doubled between April 2020 and March 2021 compared with the year before.
She says the groundswell of support for those who became isolated will be a lasting legacy of COVID-19, and she expects some of the connections they made with volunteers will continue.
A report released by the Office of the Seniors Advocate says nearly 94 per cent of people aged 65 and over live in private dwellings, nearly half of them in detached homes.
Mackenzie says the response to a call for help from volunteers was so strong that a help phone line crashed as people stepped up to help their neighbours, while seniors looking for support also overwhelmed call takers.
“Some of them (call takers) were a little upset because they had no idea how some seniors are living in very impoverished conditions,” she said on Wednesday.
Mackenzie said that while the overall program has been a success, more support is needed for seniors in smaller communities.
“The reality is, in remote areas it’s tricky,” she added.
3:57 p.m.: Newfoundland and Labrador will end its COVID-19 restrictions, including mask and vaccination requirements and gathering limits, as of March 14.
Dr. Janice Fitzgerald, chief medical officer of health, told reporters today that high vaccination rates have helped make it possible to gradually remove the remaining public health measures.
As part of a phased-in approach, Fitzgerald said that beginning Feb. 21 informal gatherings will be limited to 25 people while retail stores will have no capacity restrictions.
Restaurants, gyms, fitness studios and dance studios will be able to operate at 75 per cent capacity, while faith-based ceremonies will move to 75 per cent capacity where the vaccine passport is used, and to 50 per cent in places where the passport is not required.
As well, Fitzgerald says sports teams will be able to travel to compete outside their region but will only be allowed to play one game per day.
She says a second phase beginning Feb. 28 will see the lifting of all border controls and travel restrictions while rapid testing will become voluntary.
As of March 14, capacity and gathering limits will be removed and it will no longer be necessary to wear a mask or show proof of vaccination to enter public venues.
“Masking will continue to be strongly recommended beyond March 14,” Fitzgerald added.
She characterized the announced changes as “not the end, but the beginning of the end.”
“COVID will be here for a long time, perhaps in seasonal waves, perhaps not,” Fitzgerald said. “As a society we must learn to live with the virus and be ready to adapt.”
Health officials reported 179 new cases of novel coronavirus Wednesday, and said 16 people were in hospital, including six patients in critical care.
Three more COVID-19-related deaths were also reported, bringing the total number of deaths to 60 since the onset of the pandemic.
3:03 p.m.: A professional group representing Ontario doctors is recommending that the province fund a new model of outpatient health-care centres to help tackle a growing backlog of surgeries and other procedures.
A report from the Ontario Medical Association published Wednesday outlined a proposal to create Integrated Ambulatory Centres across the province.
The group said the centres would work with local hospitals to perform medical services insured by the province, of which thousands have been postponed during COVID-19 at various points as the health system responded to surges in virus cases.
“The need to address both the pandemic backlog and wait times is urgent,” Dr. Adam Kassam, president of the group, said at a Wednesday news conference.
“That’s why Ontario’s doctors are calling on the provincial and federal governments to act immediately and provide the necessary funding to clear the backlog now, while they work to implement the new integrated ambulatory center model.”
The medical association said its plan would free up hospital beds so hospitals can focus on responding to acute and emergency patients without sacrificing non-acute care. It also made the case that patients would have faster access to procedures with the model and spend less time in hospitals, reducing the risk of acquiring other infections while hospitalized.
3:02 p.m.: The number of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Quebec is expected to continue to decline over the next two weeks, a government health-care research institute projected Wednesday.
By the end of the month, the number of people in Quebec hospitals with COVID-19 should drop by about 500, to 1,500 patients, according to the Institut national d’excellence en santé et services sociaux. There should be about half the number of intensive care patients by that time, or about 60, it added.
“For all of Quebec, the projections suggest a slight decrease in new hospitalizations,” INESSS said in a news release, adding that it expected the number of new hospitalizations to reach around 90 per day within the next two weeks.
The research institute said its projections should be interpreted with caution as it cannot forecast the effect of changes to COVID-19 restrictions. Quebec reopened gyms and spas on Monday, shortly after lifting restrictions on private gatherings and limits on the number of people who can dine together at restaurants.
A separate health-care research institute said Wednesday that preliminary results from a vaccine study indicate three doses of COVID-19 vaccine offer more protection compared with two doses against severe and mild forms of the disease caused by the Omicron variant.
2:57 p.m.: The premier of Prince Edward Island is isolating after a member of his family tested positive for COVID-19.
Dennis King posted on Twitter Wednesday that one of his children tested positive Monday evening.
King said he has been working from home since then and following the advice of the chief public health officer. He said he’s not experiencing any symptoms and has tested negative.
The premier said he now knows first-hand the challenges and stress that isolating puts on Island households.
Meanwhile, health officials in Prince Edward Island Wednesday reported one more COVID-19-related death. They said it involved a person between the ages of 40 and 59.
There were six people in hospital with COVID-19 — down one from Tuesday.
There were 2,025 active reported cases of the virus in the province on Wednesday.
2:52 p.m.: Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet says his party will sharply oppose the use of the Emergencies Act.
He says it is unnecessary and a political move to make Trudeau appear as if he is doing something.
The Bloc leader says existing powers would be sufficient to allow the Ottawa police and RCMP to clear the protesters.
He says the Bloc is unanimously opposed and will vote against invoking measures.
2:30 p.m. A Bank of Canada deputy governor says the domestic economy could be impacted by protesters who recently blockaded key border crossings.
Timothy Lane says the blockades interrupted trade and further choked already snarled supply chains.
He says the impact on the Canadian economy may be broader than it already is if there are further blockades at the Canada-U.S. border.
Lane says the central bank is likely to consider the impacts of protests when senior officials sit down in two weeks’ time to decide whether to raise the Bank of Canada’s trendsetting interest rate.
Lane made the comments during a virtual question-and-answer session with the University of Calgary’s School of Public Policy.
The Bank of Canada is widely expected to raise its key policy rate next month from its emergency level of 0.25 per cent to cool headline inflation that in January was over five per cent for the first time since September 1991.
2 p.m. Conservative interim leader Candice Bergen says her caucus will not be supporting the Liberal government invoking the Emergencies Act over antigovernment protests on Parliament Hill.
Bergen met with her MPs this morning, and says they have many questions about why Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took the drastic measure that she calls “a massive sledgehammer.”
She says one question Tories have is what the legislation means for Canadians who may have donated to the protest weeks ago and if they now face the risk of having their bank accounts frozen.
Bergen says Conservatives are the party of law and order and so believe protesters must move their trucks because parking them for days on end is illegal.
1:42 p.m. Get out now. Or else.
That’s the warning Ottawa police officers delivered in person to truckers parked on Parliament Hill Wednesday, handing out printed flyers citing criminal code violations and new emergency powers federal and provincial governments have invoked.
“You must leave the area now. Anyone blocking streets, or assisting others in the blocking [of] streets, are [sic] committing a criminal offence and you may be facing charges,” the flyers read.
“Charges and/or convictions related to unlawful activity associated with the demonstration may lead to denial in crossing the USA border,” the notice said.

1:15 p.m. New Brunswick health officials are reporting three more COVID-19 deaths and a drop in hospitalizations.
The latest deaths involve a person in their 70s in the Moncton region, a person in their 80s in the Saint John area, and someone in their 60s in the Fredericton region. The province has reported a total of 269 COVID-19-related deaths since the start of the pandemic.
12:33 p.m. The Children’s Aid Society of Ottawa has a message to parents at the Ottawa occupation: if you are involved in “potential police action” and can’t care for your child, the CASO will step in.
The organization wants parents to make “the necessary alternate care arrangements should they become unable to care for their children.”
The CASO goes on to say that it has a mandate to protect a child if their guardian or parent can’t provide “adequate” care and custody for the child.
“If parents and children are separated following police efforts in ending the demonstration in the downtown core, CASO will work to reunite families as soon as possible,” said the CASO.
12:07 p.m. The premier of Prince Edward Island is isolating after a member of his family tested positive for COVID-19.
Dennis King posted on Twitter today that one of his children tested positive Monday evening. King says he has been working from home since then and following the advice of the Chief Public Health Office.
He says he’s not experiencing any symptoms and has tested negative. The premier says he now knows firsthand the challenges and stress that isolating puts on Island households.
As of Tuesday, seven people were hospitalized in P.E.I. as a result of COVID-19 and there were 1,885 active cases of the virus in the province.
11:30 a.m. A full return to office will be in place starting March 21, and all city facilities will be open to the public again starting on that day, Mayor John Tory says.
The city will begin the return of workers to city offices starting next week through a hybrid model.
10:20 a.m. Ontario reporting 1,403 COVID-19 hospitalizations and 364 in ICU . 54 per cent were admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 and 46 per cent were admitted for other reasons but have tested positive for COVID-19.
82 per cent of patients admitted to the ICU were admitted for COVID-19 and 18 per cent were admitted for other reasons but have tested positive for COVID-19.
There are 2,532 new cases of COVID-19, according to Health Minister Christine Elliott.
8:50 a.m. Statistics Canada says the annual pace of inflation topped five per cent for the first time in more than 30 years.
The agency says the annual inflation rate rose to 5.1 per cent in January compared with a gain for 4.8 per cent in December.
Driving much of the increase in January were prices for housing, gasoline and groceries.
Gasoline prices were up 31.7 per cent last month compared with January 2021.
8:40 a.m. Turkey’s foreign minister announced Wednesday that he tested positive for the coronavirus. Mevlut Cavusoglu, 54, said on Twitter that his symptoms were mild and that he planned to continue to work from home.
The announcement came a day after Cavusoglu returned from the United Arab Emirates, where he had accompanied Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on an official visit. Erdogan, 67, himself traveled to the UAE after recovering from COVID-19 last week.
Daily COVID-19 infections in Turkey have been hovering around the 100,000 mark in recent weeks, due to the spread of the highly transmissible omicron variant. In late December, the number of daily cases stood at about 20,000.
8 a.m. The Austrian government said Wednesday that it plans to end the country’s main COVID-19 restrictions on March 5, though wearing masks will remain obligatory in some places.
Chancellor Karl Nehammer announced the decision at a news conference in Vienna, stressing that the pandemic is not yet over but the situation allows Austria to open up step by step.
In a first step starting Saturday, proof of vaccination or recent recovery will no longer be required to attend events, go to restaurants, bars or hairdressers and various other activities. Proof of a negative test will suffice for those things. From March 5, most restrictions will be dropped, with night clubs reopening and restrictions on opening hours for restaurants and bars ending.
7:20 a.m. The Netherlands was inadequately prepared for the onslaught of the coronavirus pandemic two years ago and the government paid insufficient attention to the threat to people in care homes, according to an independent inquiry released Wednesday.
The Dutch Safety Board said authorities in the Netherlands, where more than 21,000 people are confirmed to have died of COVID-19, “became overly fixated” on hospitals in the early days of the pandemic while focusing too little attention on what it called “an unprecedented impact” on nursing homes, education, cultural institutions, and business.
The safety board’s chairman, former Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, called the pandemic the country’s biggest social crisis n decades.
“The Netherlands proved to be vulnerable,” Dijsselbloem said. “This was due to the structures the government had in place for the health sector and the crisis response: they fell short given the nature and scope of the crisis.”
6 a.m.: As a virus-weary world limps through the third year of the outbreak, experts are sending out a warning signal: Don’t expect omicron to be the last variant we have to contend with — and don’t let your guard down yet.
In the midst of a vast wave of milder infections, countries around the world are dialing back restrictions and softening their messaging. Many people are starting to assume they’ve had their run-in with COVID-19 and that the pandemic is tailing off.
That’s not necessarily the case.
The crisis isn’t over until it’s over everywhere. The effects will continue to reverberate through wealthier nations — disrupting supply chains, travel plans and health care — as the coronavirus largely dogs under-vaccinated developing countries over the coming months.
Before any of that, the world has to get past the current wave. Omicron may appear to cause less severe disease than previous strains, but it is wildly infectious, pushing new case counts to once unimaginable records. Meanwhile, evidence is emerging that the variant may not be as innocuous as early data suggest.
There’s also no guarantee that the next mutation — and there will be more — won’t be an offshoot of a more dangerous variant such as delta. And your risk of catching COVID-19 more than once is real.
5:55 a.m.: Omicron restrictions in late 2021 significantly impacted foot traffic, consumer spending and employment in Toronto’s downtown core just as businesses were on their way to recovery. Small businesses and workers in certain sectors were hit harder than others, new data shows.
The Toronto Region Board of Trade published new data Wednesday showing that in-person spending declined after November 2021, especially in the metropolitan centre, where spending was 44 per cent below 2019 levels as workers continued to telecommute instead of returning to the office.
Read the full story from the Star’s Rosa Saba.
5:52 a.m.: The Biden administration is telling Congress that it needs an additional $30 billion to press ahead with the fight against COVID-19, officials said.
Two people familiar with the administration’s plan confirmed key details on Tuesday: $17.9 billion for vaccines and treatments, $4.9 billion for testing, $3 billion to cover coronavirus care for uninsured people, and $3.7 billion to prepare for future variants. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss deliberations between the administration and lawmakers over the supplemental funding.
Separately, Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri told reporters he’d spoken with Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, and that “I think they are going to be proposing a $30 billion supplemental.”
White House press secretary Jen Psaki addressed the need for more money without specifying the amount being sought.
5:51 a.m.: South Korea will distribute free coronavirus rapid test kits at schools and senior care facilities starting next week as it weathers an unprecedented wave of infections driven by the fast-moving Omicron variant.
Health officials on Wednesday reported its highest daily jump in coronavirus infections with 90,443 new cases, shattering the previous one-day record set on Tuesday by more than 33,000 cases. The figure represents more than a 20-fold increase from the levels seen in mid-January, when omicron emerged as the country’s dominant strain, and some experts say the country could see daily cases of around 200,000 in March.
While experts say omicron appears less likely to cause serious illness or death compared to the Delta variant, which rattled the country in December and early January, hospitalizations have been creeping up amid the greater scale of outbreak.
5:51 a.m.: German vaccine maker BioNTech, which developed the first widely approved shot against COVID-19 together with Pfizer, unveiled plans Wednesday to establish manufacturing facilities in Africa that would boost the availability of much-needed medicines on the continent.
The modular design presented at a ceremony in Marburg, Germany, consists of shipping containers fitted with the equipment necessary to make the company’s mRNA-based vaccine from start to finish, save for the final step of filling doses into bottles.
BioNTech has been criticized by some campaign groups for refusing to suspend its vaccine patents and let rivals manufacture the shots as part of an effort to make them more widely available, especially in poor countries. The company argues that the process of making mRNA vaccines is difficult and it prefers to work with local partners to ensure consistent quality of the shots worldwide.
5:50 a.m.: Chancellor Olaf Scholz is conferring with Germany’s 16 state governors Wednesday to map a way out of coronavirus restrictions as official figures show new infections beginning to drift downward.
Germany saw infections caused by the Omicron variant, which is highly contagious but generally causes milder illness than previous variants, surge later than in several other European countries.
Officials have attributed this to restrictions that include curbs on private gatherings, the closure of night clubs and requirements for people to show proof of vaccination or recovery to enter restaurants and bars.
But other countries, including neighbouring Denmark, also have moved faster to lift restrictions, and there are growing calls for Germany to follow suit. Already, many German states have moved to scrap rules that prevented people without proof of vaccination or recovery from visiting non-essential stores.
5:50 a.m.: Hospitals in Hong Kong were struggling Wednesday to keep up with an influx of new coronavirus patients amid record numbers of new infections as the city’s leadership doggedly sticks to its “zero-COVID” strategy, and China’s leader Xi Jinping said it was the local government’s “overriding task” to control the situation.
Hong Kong is facing its worst outbreak of the pandemic, topping 2,000 new COVID-19 cases per day this week. The city government has already instituted strict rules, banning gatherings of more than two households.
But health care facilities are beginning to overflow, forcing the city’s Caritas Medical Center on Wednesday to treat some patients in beds outside the building.
Xi personally issued instructions and directed Vice Premier Han Zheng to express to Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam the high level of concern Chinese Communist Party leaders had about the city’s ongoing outbreak, according to Wen Wei Po, a pro-Beijing news outlet.
5:45 a.m.: Members of the Ottawa blockade that has kept the capital at a standstill for nearly three full weeks are calling the federal government’s use of the Emergencies Act a scare tactic.
Trucks, RVs and other vehicles with Canadian flags or banners with the word “freedom’’ in giant letters along their front grilles remain on Wellington Street in front of Parliament Hill, with drivers saying they will stay put until all COVID-19 vaccine mandates and restrictions are lifted.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked the act on Monday for the first time in Canadian history, with details of the regulations contained in cabinet orders published Tuesday night.
Under the act, bringing children to the antigovernment blockades, participating in the protests directly, or bringing aid such as food or fuel to those involved could result in a fine of up to $5,000 or five years in prison
Blockades are not allowed on Parliament Hill and surrounding streets, official residences, war monuments, airports, harbours, border crossings, piers, lighthouses, canals, interprovincial and international bridges, hospitals and COVID-19 vaccine clinics, trade corridors and infrastructure needed for the supply of utilities including power generation and transmission.
The cabinet orders are now in effect but must all be confirmed by motions to be put to both the House of Commons and the Senate for a vote.
The government could take until next week to table the motion invoking the act itself, but has only until Thursday to do so for the motions on the specific powers being enacted, which will remain in place for 30 days unless the government revokes them sooner.

Full text: Which level of government helped us in our years of need? Which let us down?
Reason over passion. This has always been Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s theme, in this pandemic crisis and in others, from coping with Donald Trump to easing Westerners’ fears over carbon pricing, and it has taken us through waves of danger comparatively well.
But he tends to see the best in people, including those who don’t deserve it. It’s his greatest flaw. Was Jody Wilson-Raybould a good hire? Does he really think all gun owners are law-abiding and persuadable? Was that last election call a good idea?
Let’s be reasonable. That’s Toronto Mayor John Tory’s response to almost everything, clearing parks of tent encampments so children can play, setting up safe injection sites, and working with a retrograde police service to block Toronto’s occupation by blaring tractor-trailers. It works.
But sometimes I wonder if his lack of passion impedes this city’s ambition. Look at Yonge and Bloor, Toronto’s busiest, most central and crucial intersection. That crashingly ugly half-built mess, the south side forever ruined, that’s on Tory.
God bless ’em. That’s Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s response to truck convoys blocking borders and city streets, to developers building how and where they please, and to unvaccinated people wanting to dine in Toronto restaurants. It is Ford’s cluelessness and cowardice, not high-handedness, that have landed us in this dogpile.
Of our three levels of government, only one has let citizens down and that’s the provincial government, led by this man who so often caters to our worst instincts: greed and carelessness. At no time have I ever felt that Ford had my back, to use Trudeau’s phrase.
I understand Ford. What I don’t understand is why people voted for him and may well vote for him again in the coming election on June 2. Imagine if we had had a better premier when COVID-19 hit, someone well-educated, socially adept, and open to fresh ideas, someone who hires good people. Imagine if we’d been vaccinated earlier and with ease, if public information had flowed fast and smooth, if Ontario had been Canada’s leader in a nest of provincial incompetents.
But no. We had Rob and now we have Doug. On Tuesday we saw him scuttle through the political elevator doors just as they were closing, preparing to end vaccine passports and restrictions just as it looked as if Canada’s anti-vax blockades might end (they won’t). It fooled no one. The fact is, Ford caved to the occupiers. As he did so, he openly doubted the efficacy of third doses, a slap in the public’s face.
Despite his declared state of emergency, Ford has done almost nothing to rescue Ottawa citizens. The truck convoys across Canada are using our famous decency against us, kicking us when we’re down. The only reason Toronto has so far escaped occupation is that this city runs on money, as does the Ambassador Bridge, notably the first to be rescued. We like money, we take it seriously, and we don’t block its flow.
Ford doesn’t understand cities. He lives in one but he doesn’t grasp how city dwellers think, how car life is vanishing and how the suburbs as we know them will not survive global heating. He looked so much happier out snowmobiling on the weekend while people in Ottawa cried. And yes, snowmobiling is heavenly but a more normal man wouldn’t have indulged.
I do think Ford judges people by how they vote. Toronto doesn’t vote for him. The key to political survival is not taking things personally but Ford resents our rejection. Equally, he can’t see Ottawa as a living city that exists beyond Parliament Hill. His dislike of the feds blocks his vision.
He has said “bless ’em” twice now, part of the folksiness that I admit I once found charming. It has soured now. Throw out that bag of milk. Bring us something clean and new.

Full text: Parsing the words of Ontario Premier Doug Ford is both easy and complicated.
The dissonance is sometimes so vast and risible that it’s startling that one person, within a few minutes, could utter two such incongruous thoughts.
For instance, at an announcement in Hamilton on Tuesday, the premier unburdened himself of the following opinions about what the COVID-19 pandemic and recent weeks of protest have wrought:
“I’ve never seen this country and this province so divided,” he said sorrowfully.
And seconds later:
“We’re all fighting amongst ourselves. Well, not all of us but a small percentage is fighting against the rest.”
In fact, he elaborated: There are 15 million people in Ontario and “very few are disrupting the whole economy.”
Divided? Or remarkably united? Depends on which of Ford’s words you choose.
For those looking toward the election campaign soon to come, Ford’s performance was instructive.
You could see him test-driving a slogan: “Let’s say yes!”
You could see his targeted demographic: “These are my type of hard-working women and men.”
You could hardly keep up with his everyman language: “Folks.” “Guys.” “It’s game over.” “It drives me crazy.”
The premier’s biases and key concerns were also on display.
Ford seemed more troubled that “certain widgets” couldn’t get across the border than he did about the plight of Ottawa residents who are effectively being held hostage in their homes by occupiers.
He argued that damage to the economy could hurt us “more than the pandemic could ever hurt” — despite the toll of death and illness that has devastated so many families.
At times, he seemed wholly insensitive; at others, close to tears at our trials.
The truth is, quite likely, that little of this parsing matters.
It probably doesn’t much matter politically that Ford had no answers when asked what specifically he thinks should be done to end the occupation in Ottawa, now well into its third week.
That’s because the premier understands, if only intuitively, the case made by psychologist and political strategist Drew Westen, in his book The Political Brain, that “in politics, when reason and emotion collide, emotion invariably wins.”
In Hamilton on Tuesday morning, for all his inconsistent rhetoric and buckpassing, Ford delivered a master class in emoting, connecting with the frustration and hopes of most everyone everywhere.
He has plainly calculated that the majority of Ontarians are willing to take on a little risk of another COVID uptick in exchange for a quicker reopening.
“Do you want these damn masks?” he asked. “Or do you want them off?”
“Everyone’s done with this,” he declared. “Like, we are done with it!”
The premier felt people’s pain. And he made it personal.
The pandemic and measures to cope with it have affected everyone, he said.
“It’s affected friendships. It’s affected co-workers. It’s affected families.
“I can tell you, guys, I’ve faced all three of them. And, man, it’s challenging. Especially on the family side.”
The allusion was to the high-profile anti-vaccination advocacy of one of his daughters, Krista Ford Haynes.
In telling that story, in the language he used, in the emotional chords he struck, Ford showed his opponents that – his many missteps notwithstanding – he remains a formidable opponent.
As Westen wrote, “From the standpoint of research in neuroscience, the more purely ‘rational’ an appeal, the less it is likely to activate the emotion circuits that regulate voting behaviour.”
Doug Ford is no brain doctor.
But, folks, he gets that.

Full text: Ottawa police failure a matter of numbers
What a failure of leadership, Feb. 11
For some time, columnists and TV journalists have been asking the same question about the Ottawa shutdown: Why don't police do something?
As a former police officer, I could have answered. There are far more protesters than police.
Even if police had some legal grounds to arrest, trying to actually arrest and remove a big strong guy, even if he is only resisting passively, takes three or four officers. It's worse if they are surrounded by dozens or hundreds of his screaming supporters blocking them.
Why do tow trucks refuse to take part? Again, a question of numbers.
John Boulter, Ottawa
Why do the rules not apply to Russian athletes?
Valieva can skate, but doping mess is far from clean, Feb. 15
Kamila Valieva's doping scandal came as no surprise to me; Russia has the most competitors who have been caught doping at the Olympic Games in the world, with more than 150.
If Valieva was representing any other country, her medal would be immediately stripped and she would be banned from competing.
The question is: Why does the IOC still not have a firm rule for everybody?
Why are Russian athletes more special than others?
Thuan Truong, Toronto
Public discourse should avoid such vitriolic language
Tories left with the dregs, Feb. 7; On threats against media, Feb. 12
It was interesting to read Bruce Campion-Smith's thoughtful article reminding us that threats against journalists undermine democracy. I agree that this should not happen.
However, when the Star's editors allow journalists to submit vitriol referring to the "viperous Pierre Poilievre, a frankly creepy Ottawa MP who radiates cruelty and small-mindedness," is it any wonder that some would respond to journalists in similar vein?
Jack Fearnall, Owen Sound, Ont.
Seniors aren't just beds, and deserve dignity
I am more than just an LTC bed, Feb. 11
Thanks for publishing Jennifer Brown's heartfelt denunciation of the view that seniors are just long-term-care (LTC) beds. She speaks for many of us who lament the treatment of seniors in this province.
Brown is absolutely right: LTC residents are not beds.
Our elders need to be treated with dignity and respect at the end of their lives. Our government can begin to transform the LTC system by helping seniors age at home as long as possible, with supports. When that is no longer possible for us, and we require intensive care in special facilities or hospices, we need to be attended to as persons. Not kept and made as beds.
Salvatore Amenta,
Whitchurch-Stouffville
Is Ford spending our tax dollars
on election ads?
Star ad: 'Ontario is getting stronger,' Feb. 12
The half-page ad in the Saturday Star promoting Ontario as "getting stronger" states it is paid for by "The Government of Ontario." This means our tax dollars.
It has no useful information, nor does it provide any details. It looks like a Conservative party election campaign ad to me.
With long-term care, daycare, education and health care all needing attention, aren't there better uses of tax dollars?

Full text: Ontario taxpayers will be on the hook for up to $500 million to wean the steel industry off coal and onto electricity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
In a campaign-style announcement in Hamilton - 15 weeks before the June 2 election - Premier Doug Ford promised that much in grants and loans to replace coal-fed coke ovens and blast furnaces.
"By investing in innovative technologies, we're strengthening our economy and protecting good local jobs for Ontario workers," the premier said Tuesday.
Ford said the changes would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about three million tonnes annually, which is the equivalent of taking almost one million gasoline-powered cars off the road.
The public money will go toward a $1.8 billion project by ArcelorMittal Dofasco to switch to a new kind of furnace that would tap into the electricity grid instead of using coal.
Negotiations are ongoing for a similar provincial investment in Algoma Steel in Sault Ste. Marie, Ford noted.
Last summer, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $420 million federal infusion for Algoma to transition to cleaner steel production.
Dofasco's existing steel-making operation is a massive polluter and is responsible for huge amounts of greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change."Coal will not be used in our future processes at Dofasco," said the company's president and CEO Ron Bedard.
"This investment puts us on a path to low-carbon, sustainable steel and is possible only through partnership with government."
Economic Development Minister Vic Fedeli said the cash infusion is necessary as the province steps up production of electric vehicles.
Fedeli noted cleaner cars and trucks should be manufactured using "innovative green steel" instead of with products powered by coal.
"This exciting investment ... will give automakers and other industries yet another reason to buy Ontario and hire Ontario workers when they look to transform their supply chain," the minister said.
But Green Leader Mike Schreiner said the Progressive Conservative government's pledge is "undermined" by its actions on new highway construction projects.
"Highway 413 alone will unleash 17.4 million tonnes of climate pollution by 2050 - that's more than the entire city of Toronto emitted in 2018," said Schreiner, referring to the proposed 60 kilometre highway linking Milton to Vaughan, which would raze 2,000 acres of farmland, pave over 400 acres of Greenbelt land and cut through 85 waterways.
"While I'm glad the government is finally listening, Doug Ford's stubborn refusal to make (electric vehicles) more affordable will limit widespread adoption and make life less affordable for people," he said.
"Driving electric should be an option accessible to all Ontarians."

Full text: Which level of government helped us in our years of need? Which let us down?
Reason over passion. This has always been Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's theme, in this pandemic crisis and in others, from coping with Donald Trump to easing Westerners' fears over carbon pricing, and it has taken us through waves of danger comparatively well.
But he tends to see the best in people, including those who don't deserve it. It's his greatest flaw. Was Jody Wilson-Raybould a good hire? Does he really think all gun owners are law-abiding and persuadable? Was that last election call a good idea?
Let's be reasonable. That's Toronto Mayor John Tory's response to almost everything, clearing parks of tent encampments so children can play, setting up safe injection sites, and working with a retrograde police service to block Toronto's occupation by blaring tractor-trailers. It works.
But sometimes I wonder if his lack of passion impedes this city's ambition. Look at Yonge and Bloor, Toronto's busiest, most central and crucial intersection. That crashingly ugly half-built mess, the south side forever ruined, that's on Tory.
God bless 'em. That's Ontario Premier Doug Ford's response to truck convoys blocking borders and city streets, to developers building how and where they please, and to unvaccinated people wanting to dine in Toronto restaurants. It is Ford's cluelessness and cowardice, not high-handedness, that have landed us in this dogpile.
Of our three levels of government, only one has let citizens down and that's the provincial government, led by this man who so often caters to our worst instincts: greed and carelessness. At no time have I ever felt that Ford had my back, to use Trudeau's phrase.
I understand Ford. What I don't understand is why people voted for him and may well vote for him again in the coming election on June 2. Imagine if we had had a better premier when COVID-19 hit, someone well-educated, socially adept, and open to fresh ideas, someone who hires good people. Imagine if we'd been vaccinated earlier and with ease, if public information had flowed fast and smooth, if Ontario had been Canada's leader in a nest of provincial incompetents.
But no. We had Rob and now we have Doug. On Tuesday we saw him scuttle through the political elevator doors just as they were closing, preparing to end vaccine passports and restrictions just as it looked as if Canada's anti-vax blockades might end (they won't). It fooled no one. The fact is, Ford caved to the occupiers. As he did so, he openly doubted the efficacy of third doses, a slap in the public's face.
Despite his declared state of emergency, Ford has done almost nothing to rescue Ottawa citizens. The truck convoys across Canada are using our famous decency against us, kicking us when we're down. The only reason Toronto has so far escaped occupation is that this city runs on money, as does the Ambassador Bridge, notably the first to be rescued. We like money, we take it seriously, and we don't block its flow.
Ford doesn't understand cities. He lives in one but he doesn't grasp how city dwellers think, how car life is vanishing and how the suburbs as we know them will not survive global heating.
He looked so much happier out snowmobiling on the weekend while people in Ottawa cried. And yes, snowmobiling is heavenly but a more normal man wouldn't have indulged.
I do think Ford judges people by how they vote. Toronto doesn't vote for him. The key to political survival is not taking things personally but Ford resents our rejection. Equally, he can't see Ottawa as a living city that exists beyond Parliament Hill. His dislike of the feds blocks his vision.
He has said "bless 'em" twice now, part of the folksiness that I admit I once found charming. It has soured now. Throw out that bag of milk. Bring us something clean and new.

Full text: The “occupiers” who have illegally blockaded downtown Ottawa for nearly three weeks are now causing more pain than the pandemic, says Premier Doug Ford.
Offering unequivocal support for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s invoking of the Emergencies Act, Ford blasted the protesters and said “the feds are doing what they have to do.”
“The ironic thing is … they’re hurting more people than the pandemic could ever hurt ... hundreds of thousands of jobs, millions of families,” the premier told reporters during a campaign-style swing through Hamilton.
“You can’t hold up the economy and affect hundreds of thousands of families,” he said.
“We have 15 million people (in Ontario) and you have very few disrupting the whole economy,” added Ford, pointing out the Ambassador Bridge protest in Windsor temporarily closed factories here and in the U.S.
“We are done with it. I don’t care about the politics, I care that we have a vibrant area to do business. We’re giving the tools to the police to get the job done,” he said, emphasizing politicians do not direct policing operations.
Ford said while “everyone’s frustrated” after almost two pandemic years, that’s no justification for holding the city of Ottawa “hostage” by blocking the streets around Parliament Hill with illegally parked trucks.
“It’s crazy.”

Full text: The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Tuesday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available .
5:30 p.m. The federal government announced Tuesday that it is lifting or modifying several travel-related restrictions, as Canada has now moved beyond the peak of the Omicron wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The changes will take effect Feb. 28 and only impact fully vaccinated travellers and children who may not yet be fully vaccinated.
So what will change?

3:55 p.m. Health officials in Nova Scotia are today reporting another six deaths related to COVID-19 in the province.
The deaths occurred in the province’s central, western and northern zones and involved a woman in her 60s, two women in their 70s, a woman and a man in their 80s and a man in his 90s.
Seven deaths due to the disease were reported Monday, and the total for the province sits at 182 deaths since the onset of the pandemic.
Officials also reported seven new hospital admissions and three discharges.
There are now 74 people in hospital receiving specialized care for COVID-19, including 11 in ICU.
Health officials estimate there are now 2,615 active cases in the province after 226 new lab-confirmed infections were reported.
2:40 p.m. There are 101 people in New Brunswick’s hospitals as a result of COVID-19 — a drop of 11 from Monday.
Eleven people are in intensive care and seven people are on ventilators.
Health officials are reporting one more COVID-19-related death today — a person over the age of 90 in the Saint John region.
There are 3,249 active cases of COVID-19 in the province.
The provincial dashboard shows there are 330 health-care workers who are isolating after testing positive for COVID-19.
About 48 per cent of the eligible population aged five and over have received a booster shot of COVID-19 vaccine.
2:30 p.m. The “occupiers” who have illegally blockaded downtown Ottawa for nearly three weeks are now causing more pain than the pandemic, says Premier Doug Ford.
Offering unequivocal support for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s invoking of the Emergencies Act, Ford blasted the protesters and said “the feds are doing what they have to do.”

2 p.m. New Brunswick’s commissioner on systemic racism is calling the so-called “Freedom Convoy” protest that began Friday in Fredericton a cover for a movement that is anti-government, anti-pluralist and right-wing.
Dr. Manju Varma issued a statement today stating that she reviewed materials from social media for the event held outside the provincial legislature and found racist symbolism referencing white supremacy, antisemitism and far-right extremism.
At its peak on Saturday, more than 700 people and about 300 vehicles took part in the protest that called for an end to COVID-19 vaccine mandates and that was inspired by the blockades in Ottawa.
There were no signs of protesters outside the legislature on Tuesday.
Varma says she is disappointed the New Brunswick and Canadian flags were flown alongside the flags of right-wing and extremist groups.
She says it is an act of racism to remain quiet while signs of white supremacy are exhibited in the streets of the provincial capital.
1:45 p.m . COVID-19 testing and quarantine rules will be eased for fully vaccinated travellers arriving in Canada, Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said Tuesday.
As of Feb. 28, negative results from antigen tests taken no more than 24 hours prior to departure will be accepted from fully vaccinated travellers arriving in Canada, Duclos said.
That will replace the current requirement for a negative result from a PCR test taken within 72 hours of departing for Canada. Those test results will also still be accepted from travellers, Duclos said.
The antigen test must be administered by a laboratory, health-care entity or telehealth service, Duclos said.
Mandatory random COVID-19 testing will continue at points of entry, but the government will drop the requirement that fully vaccinated travellers who have been outside Canada or the U.S. must quarantine while awaiting their test results.

1:35 p.m. Dozens of students in Alberta walked out of their classrooms Monday afternoon to protest the government's decision to lift a mask mandate in schools.
Samuel Clark, a 17-year-old co-organizer of the protest, said some students gathered at the Alberta legislature in Edmonton because they are discouraged and disturbed "to think that so many people and their parents are more concerned about the cloth on their face than protecting their peers and teachers."
"I have many friends who are immunocompromised and they are terrified. They are in Grade 12 and they really need to be at school this year to make sure they do well in some of these classes for university applications."
1:10 p.m. Restrictions are to ease in 15 Nunavut communities starting Monday as COVID-19 cases slowly drop across the territory.
Outdoor gatherings in the communities will increase to 15 people and 10 people will be able to gather in a household.
In all other communities, including Iqaluit, indoor gatherings are still restricted to five people and restaurants are closed.
Chief public health officer, Dr. Michael Patterson, says people who test positive for COVID-19 will need to notify their high-risk contacts.
Patterson says only high-risk contacts will be asked to isolate for 10 days.
Nunavut Premier P.J. Akeeagok says rapid COVID-19 tests will be distributed to essential workers in Iqaluit, including taxi drivers and grocery store staff.
1 p.m. Starting Tuesday, Toronto will be offering walk-in booster doses of COVID-19 vaccine for teens aged 12 to 17 at all five of the city’s immunization clinics.
Teens are eligible for their third dose at least six months after their second dose of vaccine.
“Approximately 94 per cent of residents ages 12 to 17 have received at least one dose of vaccine and 90 per cent have gotten two doses. Of the approximately 162,500 residents in this age group who have received two doses of the vaccine, 106,500 are eligible for a third dose starting today,” said the city in a press release.
Starting this Friday, people can book appointments online for third-dose boosters for children aged 12 to 17 at any city-run vaccine clinic using the provincial booking system or by calling the provincial vaccine booking line.

12:28 p.m. School mask mandates in Virginia would end on March 1 if the General Assembly adopts amendments made by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin to just-passed legislation on the issue.
The legislature passed a bill Monday giving parents and students the ability to opt out of mandates imposed by local school boards. But the legislation would not have taken effect until July 1.
On Monday night, Youngkin added an emergency clause to the legislation that allows it to take effect immediately upon passage. He also added a provision giving school districts until March 1 to develop plans to comply with the law.
The amended legislation now must pass both legislative chambers on a majority vote. The bill's supporters have expressed optimism that the amended bill can be passed by the legislature in a matter of days.
11:45 a.m. The Quebec government says it is phasing out the use of its vaccine passport, and it will no longer required anywhere as of March 14.
Health Minister Christian Dubé made the announcement today in Quebec City during a COVID-19 briefing.
As of Wednesday, the passport will no longer be needed to enter big-box stores or government-run liquor and cannabis outlets.
On Feb. 21, the passport will not be required at places of worship or funeral homes.
For everywhere else, including elder care settings, restaurants, bars, gyms and entertainment venues, the passport will be withdrawn as of March 14, when most COVID-19 restrictions are scheduled to expire.
11:30 a.m. Quebec is reporting 56 additional deaths due to COVID-19 and 43 fewer people in hospital.
The province has 2,052 patients hospitalized, based on 135 new admissions and 178 patients discharged. There are 132 patients listed in intensive care, a drop of four.
Quebec is reporting 1,973 new COVID-19 cases through PCR testing, which is limited to certain higher-risk groups, and another 563 cases through positive rapid test results uploaded to a government website.
10:25 a.m. Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos is expected to announce major changes to the border measures designed to counter to the spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 at 1 p.m. EST.
Currently, the government advises against all non-essential international travel because of the threat posted by the Omicron variant.
Foreign nationals coming to Canada and people travelling within the country by plane, passenger train or boat must be vaccinated against COVID-19, with few exceptions.
Right now vaccinated international travellers are subject to COVID-19 test requirements before they cross the border, and potentially again once they arrive at a Canadian airport.
10:17 a.m. Ontario is reporting 1,550 people hospitalized with COVID-19, including 384 people in ICU. The province also reported 19 deaths.
79.5 per cent of patients admitted to the ICU were admitted for COVID-19 and 20.5 per cent were admitted for other reasons but have tested positive.
There are at least 1,593 new cases of the virus in the province.
9:12 a.m. Indonesia reported a record number of new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday driven by the highly transmissible omicron variant.
The country confirmed 57,049 new infections, more than the previous record of about 56,700 set last July, when the delta variant overwhelmed hospitals on the main island of Java.
The national COVID-19 task force also reported 134 deaths on Tuesday. More than 100 people have died each day since Friday, mostly in the capital, Jakarta.

8:07 a.m. After a supply disruption that lasted for weeks, Durham’s businesses can once again get free rapid COVID-19 screening test kits for their employees from local business associations.
“I picked up the rapid tests from the Clarington Board of Trade today. I feel much safer with this tool on hand. We have had so much close contact with COVID-19, but thankfully it hasn’t spread amongst our staff as of yet,” said Ted Paulsen, owner of Chronicle Brewing in Bowmanville, via email.
“Now everyone who is worried about coming to work or if the have symptoms of COVID-19, they will be much more relieved with some assurance from these rapid tests.”
6 a.m. Ontario hospitals are facing a critical shortage of collection tubes required for routine blood work, forcing some hospitals to direct staff to conserve supplies and reconsider the number of blood tests they order for patients.
But even with conservation strategies in place, some clinicians and laboratory staff are concerned that prolonged shortages or a significant disruption in supplies could affect patient care.
They warn the shortages add another challenge to hospitals stretched by pandemic pressures, and say monitoring the supply of blood collection tubes will be even more important as hospitals reopen operating rooms to scheduled surgeries that had been paused during the Omicron wave .

5:40 a.m. If forced to choose, Novak Djokovic said he would skip the French Open and Wimbledon, foregoing the chance to overtake Rafael Nadal’s record haul of 21 Grand Slams titles, rather than get vaccinated against COVID-19.
And the No. 1-ranked tennis player is also still smarting about being deported last month from Australia in a drama about his vaccination status that polarized opinion worldwide.
Speaking in an interview broadcast Tuesday by the BBC, the 20-time Grand Slam champion said he is still not vaccinated, and prepared to sacrifice titles to stay that way.
Read more from The Associated Press.
5:30 a.m. Experts say Canada’s COVID-19 protests may be providing Russian President Vladimir Putin with a welcome distraction.
The White House believes if Putin intends to invade Ukraine, it could happen before week’s end.
Bessma Momani, a University of Waterloo professor and a senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation, says she’s convinced Russian hackers played a role in stoking the anger behind the protests.
Momani says Russia wants to exploit cultural tensions in the U.S. and Canada to undermine public faith in democracy.

5:15 a.m. British Columbia’s top doctor is expected to announce the plan today for gradually easing public health restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19.
The most recent public health orders related to gatherings, events, bars and restaurants, for example, were set to expire on Wednesday and provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has said she would announce any chances a day earlier.
Henry also said last month people could expect some restrictions on social gatherings to be gradually lifted by next Monday, which marks Family Day.

5:05 a.m. Ontario is easing COVID-19 capacity restrictions starting Thursday — and as of March 1, proof of vaccination will no longer be required, although indoor masking rules will stay in place for “a little bit longer,” says Premier Doug Ford .
Ford also gave the go-ahead Monday to booster shots for those aged 12 to 17.
“As I’ve said from the very beginning, the extraordinary measures that we introduced during this pandemic were always intended as a last resort,” Ford said at Queen’s Park, adding he promised Ontarians that “these tools would only be used for as long as they were absolutely necessary and not one day longer.
Read more from the Star’s Kristin Rushowy and Rob Ferguson.
5 a.m. There are some concerns about the federal government’s decision to invoke the Emergencies Act to end antigovernment blockades against COVID-19 measures that are being held across the country.
The Canadian Civil Liberties Association says it does not believe the “high and clear” threshold needed to invoke the act has been met, noting the law states it can only be used when a situation cannot be dealt with using any other law in the country.
Executive director Noa Mendelsohn Aviv warns that normalizing emergency legislation “threatens our democracy and our civil liberties.”

Full text: It shouldn’t have come to this.
What Canadians, and the world, are witnessing is not a national emergency on a scale similar to 9/11 or that of October 1970, when a violent separatist group kidnapped two high-ranking officials and murdered the deputy premier.
What led Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to invoke the Emergencies Act Monday — a more democratic and Charter-compliant version of the War Measures Act his father used in 1970 — is the catastrophic failure of local and provincial policing, and the abdication of the Ontario government to do its job.
The demonstrators who blocked the Detroit-Windsor Ambassador Bridge and who continue to occupy downtown Ottawa are well-funded and well-organized. But they are mostly non-violent, seemingly more interested in barbecuing and partying than storming Parliament Hill. Does this situation really threaten our territorial integrity and security? Is Canada’s biggest hammer really necessary?
I don’t want to minimize the real fear many Ottawa residents feel. The apparent attempted arson of a downtown apartment building whose doors were taped shut sent chills throughout the city, as did last weekend’s report of demonstrators attempting to handcuff the doors of another apartment building.
Monday’s announcement that the RCMP seized a large collection of guns and ammunition and arrested 13 people near the Coutts, Alta. border crossing is a reminder there are intelligence reports the public is unaware of.
But watching the staggering number of cops descend on the handful of protesters left in Windsor Sunday, most of whom willingly drove away without charges, shows us that we have laws to deal with this type of behaviour. From Ontario’s emergency measures Saturday to Criminal Code offences such as mischief, unlawful assembly, and riot, the police have the capacity to enforce the law, if they choose to.
“They have everything they need,” Leah West, an assistant professor of international affairs at the Norman Paterson School of International Affairs at Carleton University told me Monday. “For (Ontario Premier Doug) Ford to support this especially, I don’t get it. Unless he’s just trying to not be the one to crack down.”
The protests have laid bare perplexing political stances.
Ford, who is up for re-election this June, wholeheartedly supported federal action to step in to establish calm in the province’s second-largest city and maintain the free flow of goods at the most important Canada-U.S. border crossing. To keep, as Ford said — and as he campaigned — Ontario “open for business.”
His stance is in sharp contrast to Alberta Premier Jason Kenney who said the federal Emergencies Act was “not necessary” for his province. “We have all of the necessary statutory powers and operational capacity for enforcement.” Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe, who also opposes the measure, noted that “also police already have sufficient tools to enforce the law and clear the blockades, as they did over the weekend in Windsor.”
On Parliament Hill, the politics are equally baffling. The NDP opposed the War Measures Act in 1970, with then-leader Tommy Douglas arguing the federal government had the tools to deal with the crisis without invoking such a draconian law and decrying the loss of civil liberties. Today, the party backed the Liberals’ use of the Emergencies Act. Its MPs in the House suggested the Liberals should have acted 18 days ago.
The Bloc Québécois, which spent the past two weeks calling for tougher action against the protesters, said it isn’t opposed to the Emergencies Act as long as it doesn’t apply in Quebec.
Meanwhile, the Conservatives, once known as Canada’s law and order party, urged continued negotiations with the protesters and raised concerns using the Emergencies Act would inflame the situation.
Negotiations did take place between one of the protest organizers and the mayor of Ottawa. The result is that now more trucks line the street in front of the Prime Minister’s Office. Another organizer, Benjamin Dichter, suggested if authorities are willing to negotiate the group will “start piling on other demands” such as demanding Transport Minister Omar Alghabra resign because of his background — another example of the racism and Islamophobia embedded in the movement.
Questions about the uneven application of the law have raised concerns about racism being embedded in the police. If the protesters were brown and had long beards would the police stand by while they blocked the Ambassador Bridge?
Is it that there aren’t enough laws or that the laws are not being enforced? Few demonstrators have been ticketed and charged, despite weeks of illegal behaviour. A video of an OPP officer saying he supports the demonstrators “100 per cent” further contributes to the idea that the cops don’t want to police people they see as their own.
Then, of course, there are questions about competency. Ottawa police Chief Peter Sloly has said the city’s cops are doing “everything (they) can.” Though it doesn’t seem that way. Saturday, the police announced they had formed an “integrated command centre” with the RCMP and the OPP. Yes, everyone scratched their head wondering why this hadn’t happened sooner.
This all leads to a more troubling question. What if the Emergencies Act doesn’t change a thing? What if the police chose not to use the new tools at their disposal?
Then, Trudeau will have to do something he really doesn’t want to do: call in the army.

Full text: It shouldn't have come to this.
What Canadians, and the world, are witnessing is not a national emergency on a scale similar to 9/11 or that of October 1970, when a violent separatist group kidnapped two high-ranking officials and murdered the deputy premier.
What led Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to invoke the Emergencies Act Monday - a more democratic and Charter-compliant version of the War Measures Act his father brought into force in 1970 - is the catastrophic failure of local and provincial policing, and the abdication of the Ontario government to do its job.
The demonstrators who blocked the Detroit-Windsor Ambassador Bridge and who continue to occupy downtown Ottawa are well-funded and well-organized. But they are mostly non-violent, seemingly more interested in barbecuing and partying than storming Parliament Hill. Does this situation really threaten our territorial integrity and security? Is Canada's biggest hammer really necessary?
I don't want to minimize the real fear many Ottawa residents feel. The apparent attempted arson of a downtown apartment building whose doors were taped shut sent chills throughout the city, as did last weekend's report of demonstrators attempting to handcuff the doors of another apartment building.
Monday's announcement that the RCMP seized a large collection of guns and ammunition and arrested 13 people near the Coutts, Alta., border crossing is a reminder there are intelligence reports the public is unaware of.
But watching the staggering number of cops descend on the handful of protesters left in Windsor Sunday, most of whom willingly drove away without charges, shows us that we have laws to deal with this type of behaviour. From Ontario's emergency measures Saturday to Criminal Code offences such as mischief, unlawful assembly and riot, the police have the capacity to enforce the law, if they choose to.
"They have everything they need," Leah West, an assistant professor of international affairs at the Norman Paterson School of International Affairs at Carleton University told me Monday. "For (Ontario Premier Doug) Ford to support this especially, I don't get it. Unless he's just trying to not be the one to crack down."

Chantal Hébert: Centrist Conservatives may have found their champion in the battle for the soul of the party

Full text: MONTREAL—Barely two years ago, Jean Charest ruled out a run for the federal Conservative leadership because he could not see a path to victory. Now the former Quebec premier is once again seriously considering a bid, with a decision apparently to come over the next week or so. What changed?
In a replay of the scenario that attended Andrew Scheer’s resignation at the end of 2019, Charest’s name predictably resurfaced on the list of possible successors to Erin O’Toole almost as soon as the latter was ousted from the leadership. His phone has been ringing off the hook.
But the difference this time is the people who are doing the calling.
Two years ago, many of those who were pushing Charest to run were former supporters, as often as not long-time associates from the Brian Mulroney era and the bygone days of the Progressive Conservative party.
Within the more recent ranks of the Conservative party, enthusiasm for a Charest bid was at best tepid.
Back then for instance, the former premier could not persuade then-Quebec lieutenant Alain Rayes — along with other Quebec MPs — to back his bid.
Instead Rayes opted to sit out the campaign.
At the same time, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, then the leading provincial voice within the Canadian conservative movement, made it clear he would use his significant influence to keep Charest (and others like him, such as Peter MacKay) from taking the helm.
Stephen Harper would not give the former premier his blessing.
But since then, Kenney’s star has faded. As he fights for his political life in Alberta, he is no longer in a position to play the larger leadership role that was once his. And while Harper remains a force within the party, time out of office has also taken a toll on his influence.
For his part, Rayes is all in this time. Earlier this week he resigned his caucus post, the better to participate in the leadership battle. He says he is looking for a fiscally conservative but socially progressive leader. He has been speaking with Charest. By all indications, he would be willing to play a leading role in his leadership campaign.
At the same time, a movement to elect a leader liable to champion a serious climate change agenda is afoot.
This week, former deputy leader Lisa Raitt announced she was spearheading a Conservative group committed to ensuring that the next leader brings a comprehensive climate change policy to party members.
As a former federal environment minister and as one of the first premiers to introduce carbon pricing in his province, Charest has a climate change track record few Conservatives can match these days.
From the perspective of those looking for a strong candidate with credible climate change credentials and/or a more progressive outlook, the stakes in this leadership campaign are higher than in 2020.
With MacKay and O’Toole as the main contenders in that battle, the many Conservatives who believed the party needed to carve a more centrist path to power assumed that one way or another, they would end up with a like-minded leader. Rather than concentrate their forces behind one or the other, they dispersed in the two camps.
But with Ottawa MP Pierre Poilievre as the perceived front-runner, the outlook could not be more different and the divide starker.
For the many Conservatives who supported O’Toole’s efforts to recast the party along more mainstream lines, the scorched earth brand of conservatism Poilievre practises is a non-starter.
They feel his disdain for carbon pricing, his visceral opposition to a child care social policy along the lines of Quebec’s popular program and, more recently, his flirtation with the convoy that has blockaded the federal capital along with strategic border points will make the party less rather than more attractive to mainstream voters.
They are looking for someone strong enough to beat him. In many Conservative minds, the upcoming battle is one for the soul of the party.
It is an open secret that Charest has always harboured prime ministerial ambitions. His first leadership run dates back almost 30 years to 1993. Even over his three-term tenure as premier, he continued to long for the federal pastures.
At the same time, Justin Trudeau leads a third-term government that is increasingly acting its age in the lethargic sense of the word.
All week, the prime minister and his team struggled to project the kind of energy voters would expect from a government in crisis management mode.
These days, it is easier to see a path to ousting the Liberals from office in the next election than it was two years ago, especially if they are to be led by an increasingly disengaged leader. From Charest’s perspective, that makes for an even stronger temptation to run.

Full text: The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Monday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available .
8:10 p.m.: B.C.’s Health Ministry is reporting another 17 deaths linked to COVID-19 in the province over the past three days, bringing the death toll to 2,764.
Hospitalization rate continues to decline at 803 people from 846 on Friday, while 119 are in intensive care down from 136.
The ministry says in a statement there have been no new health-care facility outbreaks over the weekend, and most of the 39 active outbreaks are in seniors’ care homes.
B.C. is reporting 2,701 new cases of the virus but officials have said this number is likely much higher because the province has reached its testing capacity.
7:35 p.m.: The Canadian Civil Liberties Association says it does not believe the federal government has met the “high and clear” threshold needed to invoke the Emergencies Act.
Noa Mendelsohn Aviv, executive director of the association, says the law says it can only be invoked when a situation cannot be dealt with using any other law in the country.
She says governments deal with tough situations all the time, using powers they have through democratically elected representatives.
She warns against normalizing emergency legislation, which she says “threatens our democracy and our civil liberties.”
6:31 p.m.: The City of Ottawa says it is making some of the tow trucks from its transit fleet available as part of the response to the ongoing demonstrations in Ottawa.
The city says it removed OC Transpo decals from the trucks in preparation, as the transit service will not be operating the vehicles.
The tow trucks are being provided on the condition they are operated by drivers with relevant experience and the appropriate licence.
6:30 p.m.: On Monday, the Saskatchewan Party government decommissioned the app that businesses used to scan QR codes for proof of vaccination. The app is no longer available for download by new users and current users have been asked to delete the app from their devices.
Some businesses and organizations have said they will continue to check people’s vaccination status despite the government’s decision.
The province has two remaining health orders in place. One requires people to wear masks in indoor public places and the second mandates self-isolation when someone tests positive for the virus.
6:25 p.m.: The premier of Prince Edward Island says he told his fellow premiers and the prime minister that the Emergencies Act wasn’t required at this time for his province, but that he respects the decision to provide further assistance to provinces requiring it.
Dennis King issued a statement about discussions Justin Trudeau held earlier today with premiers, before he announced the Emergencies Act would be used to bring to an end antigovernment blockades against COVID-19 health measures and vaccine mandates.
6 p.m.: Quebec Premier François Legault said he would meet with public health officials Monday night to discuss whether the province’s vaccine passport system should remain in use.
Speaking to reporters in Longueuil, Que., Legault said Health Minister Christian Dubé plans to “get rid of the pass as soon as we get the OK from public health.” He said an announcement on the future of the vaccine passport could come as early as Tuesday.
5:40 p.m.: The federal government took the unprecedented step on Monday of invoking the Emergencies Act to deal with the ongoing convoy occupation in Ottawa and blockades that have affected border crossings across the country.
Although passed in 1988 as a replacement to the War Measures Act, the Emergencies Act has never been used before.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday that invoking the act is a way of giving additional tools to police forces dealing with blockades.
So, what does the Emergencies Act do?
Read Jacques Gallant’s explainer here.
5:30 p.m.: Federal Conservatives are decrying a vote against what they argue was a reasonable motion asking the federal government for a plan to lift remaining COVID-19 restrictions.
The Tories unveiled the non-binding proposal as part of a regular opposition day motion.
Liberals and New Democrats voted against the motion, while members of the Bloc Québécois joined the Conservatives in the vote this afternoon in the House of Commons.
The final vote was 185 against and 151 in favour.
5:15 p.m.: Labour Minister Seamus O’Regan spoke in St. John’s, N.L., today about the ongoing protests in Ottawa.
O’Regan says it’s important to remember that about 3,000 Canadians have died of COVID-19 since the demonstrators first converged on the capital.
Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Andrew Furey says he’s concerned with the degree to which the protesters have been able to disrupt people’s lives.
He said the protests have given Canada a “black eye” on the world stage and the time has come for participants to pack up and leave.
4:50 p.m.: The federal government is broadening the scope of anti-money laundering rules to cover crowdfunding sites.
Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland says such sites are being used to support illegal blockades.
She says they will now be required to report to the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada.
She says the move, to be made permanent, will allow Fintrac to make more information available to police and other enforcement agencies.
4:39 p.m.: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has invoked the Emergencies Act in response to the truck blockades occupying Ottawa.
This is the first time the act has been used in Canada. The legislation can be used to grant the federal government special powers during a national crisis.
“We are not using the Emergency Act to call in the military. We are not suspending fundamental rights or overriding the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.”
Trudeau also said that the occupation is “not a peaceful protest,” citing reports of harassment and fearful residents. He condemned the border blockades for their economic impacts.
Police will get strengthened abilities to impose fines and jail people in certain geographical area and they will get more power to protect critical infrastructure, and ensure essential services, like towtrucks, can be used to clear trucks blocking roads.
This is the first time the Emergencies Act has been invoked since it came into force in 1988.
3:18 p.m.: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will tell Canadians later today he is invoking the Emergencies Act for the first time as antigovernment blockades continue, according to a source granted anonymity to discuss matters not yet made public.
Trudeau met with his cabinet Sunday and consulted with premiers earlier today about the use of the act, which could give the federal government temporary and extraordinary powers to curtail the demonstrations.
3:16 p.m.: The largest labour organization in Alberta has gone to court to challenge the province’s decision to lift a mask mandate in classrooms.
The Alberta Federation of Labour says in a news release that a request for an injunction to keep masks in place was filed Sunday on behalf of several parents who have children living with disabilities.
The government announced last week that starting today, students in schools would no longer be required to wear face coverings.
As well, children 12 and under no longer have to wear masks in any setting.
The union says it is also challenging Education Minister Adrianna LaGrange’s announcement last week that it’s now illegal for schools boards to bring in their own rules to override the province.
1:37 p.m.: An Ontario judge has granted an injunction to enforce noise and idling bylaws in Ottawa.
The protest by antigovernment demonstrators blockading city streets around Parliament Hill is now in its third week.
City solicitor David White requested the injunction Friday, saying the protesters were flagrantly violating bylaws against relentless noise, idling of trucks, setting off fireworks, and open air fires.
1:34 p.m.: Protesters outside Parliament Hill appear to be in a festive mood, even as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks with premiers about using the Emergencies Act to quell the demonstration.
Trudeau met with his cabinet for an urgent meeting Sunday night and is on a phone call with provincial and territorial premiers today.
A source aware of the planned conversation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, confirms the prime minister is talking to the premiers about using the legislation as the Emergencies Act’s criteria requires.
Trudeau also briefed his caucus early this morning in a virtual meeting held two days before the Liberals’ regularly scheduled Wednesday gathering.
The Emergencies Act, which replaced the War Measures Act in 1988, allows a government to invoke temporary measures, including barring people from gathering or travelling to certain locations, to protect national security, public order and public welfare.
It has never been used before.
This afternoon a dozen or so protesters danced around waving Canada flags to pop music blasting from speakers, while trucks honked and jerry cans lined Wellington Street.
There were far fewer people on the streets and sidewalks than previous days of the protest.
Still, some children played with toys set up on the street outside the main entrance to the West Block.
1:34 p.m.: Ottawa is investing $672,000 into Nova Scotian organizations to boost COVID-19 vaccine uptake in undervaccinated communities throughout the province and the Atlantic region.
Liberal MP for Halifax Andy Fillmore announced today the money would be invested into three outreach programs through the federal Immunization Partnership Fund to tackle vaccine hesitancy and misinformation.
Fillmore says the goal of the fund is to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines.
Maria Cain, a manager at Immigrant Services Association of Nova Scotia, says $226,000 will be used to target newcomers to Canada by creating culturally relevant tools to address concerns about the vaccine in the immigrant community.
1:33 p.m.: RCMP say they have arrested 11 people at the main United States border crossing in southern Alberta after becoming aware of a cache of firearms and ammunition.
Demonstrators have been protesting against COVID-19 vaccine mandates for cross-border truck drivers and broader health restrictions near Coutts, Alta.
A blockade of trucks and vehicles has been at the crossing since Jan. 29.
Mounties say they learned of a small organized group within the protest that was said to have a “willingness to use force against the police if any attempts were made to disrupt the blockade.”
RCMP say in a news release that an investigation began immediately to determine the extent of the threat.
They say officers searched three trailers Monday morning believed to be linked to a criminal organization.
Thirteen long guns, handguns, multiple sets of body armour, a machete, a large quantity of ammunition and high-capacity magazines were seized.
1:23 p.m.: In Britain, the Duchess of Cornwall has tested positive for COVID-19, Clarence House has announced.
Camilla, 74, caught the virus for the first time just days after the Prince of Wales contracted the illness for a second time.
A Clarence House spokesman said: “Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cornwall has tested positive for COVID-19 and is self-isolating.
“We continue to follow government guidelines.”
Camilla is triple vaccinated, sources said.
12 p.m. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government is seeking to invoke the never-used Emergencies Act to deal with protesters crippling Canada’s borders.
The Act gives the federal government extraordinary 30-day time-limited powers, to prohibit public assembly, travel, and the use of specific property. It would allow Ottawa to designate protected places and force tow-truck companies, for example, to lend their trucks to the government to clear the roads. The Liberal government does not intend to use the Act to call in the army for now, two sources said.
Trudeau’s cabinet met last night to discuss the issue. It’s the first time the Emergencies Act could be enacted. It was mulled over in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic but most premiers felt the reach was unnecessary.

11:45 a.m. Commercial trucks and other vehicles are flowing normally over the reopened Ambassador Bridge Monday, with police keeping a close watch on the busy international border crossing.
Traffic resumed on the key trade route just before midnight after it was blocked for nearly a week due to a protest against COVID-19 measures on the Canadian side of the bridge linking Windsor and Detroit.
Police moved in to clear demonstrators from the foot of the bridge on Sunday, making more than two dozen arrests.
This morning, police cruisers are on standby along a stretch of the roadway leading to the bridge entrance, while certain intersections are blocked off to prevent demonstrators from returning to the foot of the bridge.
11:35 a.m. Quebec is reporting 17 more deaths linked to the coronavirus Monday and a rise of 14 COVID-19 hospitalizations.
The Health Department says 2,095 patients are in hospital with the disease, after 107 people were admitted in the last 24 hours and 93 were discharged.
Officials say the number of people in intensive care declined by four, to 136. Earlier today, gyms and spas were allowed to reopen at half capacity across Quebec, after they were closed in December to reduce transmission of the Omicron variant of the virus.
11:22 a.m. A handful of demonstrators and a half-dozen vehicles are all that remain today of a protest against COVID-19 vaccine mandates in Fredericton.
That’s down from about 700 people and 300 vehicles on Saturday at the peak of the noisy protest in front of the provincial legislature.
Protest organizer Mitchell Albert of Moncton, N.B., says he plans to stay until all COVID-19 vaccine mandates in the province are dropped.
Albert says he expects more people from across the Maritimes and Ottawa to join the protest in New Brunswick’s capital.
Patty Every of Amherst, N.S., says she plans to stay indefinitely in order to get the government to listen.
10:20 a.m. Ontario is reporting 1,369 people hospitalized with COVID-19, 394 in ICU.
Note that not all hospitals report on weekends. The province is reporting 1,765 new cases of COVID-19.
10 a.m. Large trucks and cars are travelling across the Ambassador Bridge border crossing in Windsor this morning.
The bridge linking Windsor and Detroit reopened to traffic last night after a protest against COVID-19 restrictions on the Canadian side blocked the flow of traffic in the area for nearly a week.
Police cruisers are on standby along a stretch of the roadway leading to the bridge entrance in Windsor.
9:50 a.m . Ontario is easing COVID-19 capacity restrictions starting this Thursday — and as of March 1 proof of vaccination will no longer be required, Premier Doug Ford has announced.
Booster shots are also getting the go-ahead for 12- to 17-year olds.
“Given how well Ontario has done in the Omicron wave we are able to fast track our reopening plan,” Ford said. “This is great news and a sign of just how far we’ve come together in our fight against the virus. While we aren’t out of the woods just yet we are moving in the right direction.”

9:05 a.m. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has unveiled new coronavirus guidelines for the cruise industry, allowing cruise lines to operate under different tiers based on the vaccination status of passengers and crew as part of a voluntary program.
And those tiers could change how long passengers are recommended to quarantine after exposure to the coronavirus.
In its updated guidelines Feb. 9, the CDC maintained it’s best to “avoid” cruise travel — and cautioned people should be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 if they can’t resist a vacation on the high seas.
Cruise lines have until Feb. 18 to opt into the COVID-19 Program for Cruise Ships, which separates ships into three vaccination status tiers.
8:45 a.m. Premier Doug Ford will make an announcement at 9:30 a.m. on Monday.
He will be joined by Health Minister Christine Elliott and Dr. Kieran Moore, Chief Medical Officer of Health, to make the announcement.
7:25 a.m. New Zealand’s prime minister on Monday said protesters who oppose coronavirus mandates were using “intimidation and harassment,” as authorities appeared to take a harsher stance toward the convoy of demonstrators that has disrupted the capital of Wellington for nearly a week.
Police initially let the protesters set up tents and camp on the grounds of New Zealand’s Parliament before arresting 122 people on Thursday and then backing off again. The size of the protest dropped to a few hundred last week but increased again to around 3,000 over the weekend.
Speaking with reporters, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern signaled the thinning patience of authorities.
“I very clearly have a view on the protesters and the way that they’ve conducted their protest because it has moved beyond sharing a view to intimidation and harassment of the people around central Wellington,” she said. “That cannot be tolerated.”
6:07 a.m. Nili Kaplan-Myrth’s 13-year-old daughter refused to go back to school after the holidays without a third COVID-19 vaccine dose.
Her daughter, who attends school in central Ottawa, said she did not want to risk catching COVID during periods when classmates were permitted to not wear masks such as lunch or in gym class and opted to continue with online learning, Kaplan-Myrth said.
“The idea that we should be concerned about our kids only if they end up in hospital is a fallacy,” said Kaplan-Myrth, a family doctor in Ottawa.

5:52 a.m. Hong Kong plans to offer COVID-19 vaccines to children as young as 3 as infections rage through the semi-autonomous Chinese city.
The announcement Monday came as the government reported 1,347 new cases, all but two of them locally acquired.
The wave blamed on the Omicron variant has already prompted new restrictions limiting in-person gatherings to no more than two households. Hong Kong residents have been rushing to grocery stories to stock up on vegetables and to hair salons to get haircuts.
5:40 a.m. Cabinet will meet early Monday morning to discuss easing COVID-19 restrictions in the province, sources say.
The meeting comes as both Premier Doug Ford and Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Kieran Moore indicated last week that given the improved COVID-19 situation, measures such as vaccine passports — which they had always said were temporary — could soon be dropped.
“With encouraging trends in community transmission and our hospitalization and ICU admission trending downwards, we can now see that the Omicron peak is behind us,” Moore said at his weekly press conference last Thursday.

5:30 a.m. South Korea’s parliament on Monday approved plans to provide a special time for COVID-19 patients to vote during the March 9 presidential election as the country grapples with a record-breaking omicron surge.
The proposed revision of an election-related law will take effect if it is endorsed by the Cabinet Council and signed by the president — steps widely considered a formality since the governing and opposition parties have already agreed on the measure.
Voters diagnosed with highly infectious diseases such as COVID-19 and others placed in quarantine would be allowed to visit polling stations and cast ballots after regular voting closes at 6 p.m., according to a copy of the legislation on the website of the National Assembly. The special voting time would close at 7:30 p.m.
5:22 a.m. As the crushing pressure from the Omicron wave eases, Ontario hospitals must now confront a massive surgical backlog that has forced hundreds of thousands of people to wait for scheduled surgeries, including joint replacements, cataract surgeries and some cancer procedures.
Surgical shutdowns during the pandemic — needed to free up hospital resources for COVID-19 patients — have created system-wide disruptions and a backlog of surgeries that experts say will take years to clear.
And despite efforts to catch up in between pandemic waves, experts say the wait lists for many non-urgent surgeries and procedures have continued to swell. They warn the province must not only fund additional system capacity but rethink how it offers surgical care.

5 a.m. Ontario’s finance minister is set to release an update Monday on the province’s finances.
Peter Bethlenfalvy will release Ontario’s third-quarter finances and discuss the province’s economic and fiscal outlook.
The financial update comes not long before the province’s anticipated budget, which has to be tabled by March 31.
Ontario’s Financial Accountability Office released a report last week that predicted smaller deficits than the government’s previous projections, largely due to increases in revenue.
The FAO expects a budget deficit of $2.8 billion by 2023-24, compared to a government outlook last fall of $11.4 billion.
The government’s fall economic statement projects far less revenue compared to the FAO’s assessment, and the fiscal watchdog says some of that gap – $1.7 billion in 2023-24 – could be potential unannounced tax cuts.
4 a.m. After nearly two years of going to school with their faces covered, students in Alberta now have the option to ditch their masks.
While some have said they welcome the step toward normalcy, others say they are anxious and worried over what has become a divisive, political issue in the COVID-19 pandemic.
“There’s very little information about how the schools are doing, so maybe it’ll be fine,” said Emma Stephens, a mother of two from Lethbridge, Alta.
“I don’t personally believe it’ll be fine ... because when you when you take your mitigation measures off, then the cases go up.
“So the issue now is there’s going to be some kids who feel differently than we do, families feel differently than we do and they won’t want to wear masks and then that causes tension for my kids.”
The government announced last week that starting Monday, students in schools would no longer be required to wear masks. As well, children 12 and under don’t have to wear masks in any setting.
4 a.m. Gyms and spas are set to reopen at half capacity across Quebec Monday as the province enters the next phase of its COVID-19 reopening plan.
The latest effort to ease public health measures that forced thousands of businesses to close in late December takes effect amid an ongoing decline in virus-related hospitalizations and deaths.
Indoor sports and recreation activities can also resume as of today, including extracurriculars at colleges and universities, with a maximum of 25 participants per group.
Capacity caps at outdoor events are increasing to 5,000 people, while sports competitions and tournaments remain prohibited until Feb. 28.
Premier François Legault initially presented a go-slow reopening plan in early January before announcing last Tuesday that most public health measures would be lifted by March 14, though the provincial vaccine passport system and mask mandates will remain in place.
The accelerated reopening road map began over the weekend when all limits on indoor private gatherings were removed and restaurants were allowed to seat a maximum of 10 people at the same table.

Full text: Ontario is easing COVID-19 capacity restrictions starting Thursday — and as of March 1, proof of vaccination will no longer be required, although indoor masking rules will stay in place for “a little bit longer,” says Premier Doug Ford .
Ford also gave the go-ahead Monday to booster shots for those aged 12 to 17.
“As I’ve said from the very beginning, the extraordinary measures that we introduced during this pandemic were always intended as a last resort,” Ford said at Queen’s Park, adding he promised Ontarians that “these tools would only be used for as long as they were absolutely necessary and not one day longer.
“The removal of these measures has always been our objective and something we have collectively worked towards for months now.”
Starting Thursday, social gatherings can increase to 50 people indoors and 100 outdoors, and capacity limits will be completely eliminated in restaurants, bars, gyms and other places requiring proof of vaccination.
Sports arenas will be allowed to operate at 50 per cent capacity, as will concert venues and live theatres. Cinemas can operate at full capacity. Indoor capacity limits at nightclubs, restaurants with dancing, bathhouses and sex clubs will be 25 per cent.
Should COVID-19 and hospitalization numbers continue to decrease, the province will drop all capacity limits indoors and end the need for vaccination certificates at the beginning of March, although businesses can opt to keep them.
While the NDP accused Ford of pandering to protesters who have blockaded border crossings — and who are still encamped in Ottawa — the premier said loosening restrictions “is not because of what’s happening in Ottawa or Windsor, but despite it.”
Easing of restrictions and phasing out proof-of-vaccination certificates makes sense as infection levels decline, said Dr. Peter Jüni, the scientific director of the science table advising Ford and chief medical officer of health Dr. Kieran Moore.
“That’s supported by the data,” Jüni told the Star in an interview.
Ontario has hit a point where the vaccination passport system either needed to be lifted or updated to include three doses of a vaccine and/or recent infection with COVID-19, he added.
Epidemiologist Todd Coleman of Wilfrid Laurier University said many Ontarians who have had only two doses received their second ones more than four months ago, rendering the two-dose passports less effective.
“They’re not a precise tool at this point to prevent infection,” he said.
Jüni suggested leaving the masking requirement in place “until the weather is really good. We shouldn’t pretend the pandemic’s over.”
During Monday’s announcement, Ford took a moment to speak of the division he’s seen over COVID-19 measures, and how it has affected his own family.
“All of it has polarized us in a way that we could have never imagined,” said Ford, whose daughter Krista Haynes has posted anti-vaccination and anti-mask sentiments on social media.
“I’ve experienced this in my own family. It’s been one of the hardest things my family and I have ever gone through. But for all of this, I can still take comfort in knowing that there remains so much that unites us.”
Moore said masking rules could be relaxed down the road, depending on the number of COVID-19 patients hospitalized and in intensive care, as well as the availability of PCR testing. He has previously said that if masking requirements are dropped, coverings would still be required on public transit and in schools.
Ford said while vaccination certificates may end, two doses will be required for visitors to long-term-care homes.
Ontario is “now down the slope from the peak of Omicron activity,” with 92 per cent of Ontarians over age 12 double-vaccinated and 6.7 million Ontarians triple-vaccinated, Moore said.
“We have the level of protection that we need to remove public health measures and have made terrific strides on reducing the risk,” he said. “Our health system is in much better position now.”
Proof of vaccination, he added, has “served its purpose … in our estimation, given where we are in the epidemic as of March 1, it will no longer be necessary.”
The Canadian Federation of Independent Business welcomed the news and said its recent survey data showed that 66 per cent of Ontario’s small businesses believe it’s time for proof-of-vaccination requirements to be eliminated. But that means about one third do not agree with scrapping vaccination passports.
“There’s no question that there are some business owners, including some that are in restaurants, the arts and entertainment, gyms, who feel like vaccine passports have value as a reassurance for customers,” said CFIB president Dan Kelly.
“We’ve been told for at least six months that mixing vaccinated and unvaccinated populations is dangerous, so it’s going to take some time for people to get their heads around (dropping the requirement),” he said.
In Windsor, where police cleared protesters blocking the Ambassador Bridge over the weekend, New Democrat Leader Andrea Horwath accused Ford of catering to protesters with the easing of restrictions.
“I think it’s always very dangerous to cave in to people who are breaking the law,” she said, raising concerns that the vaccination certificate program is being lifted too soon and missing an opportunity to require third doses for it.
“I suspect this is all about the election in June.”
Coleman, who is also a former public health official in London, said the reliance on hospitalization statistics, which are a lagging indicator of infection, and the lack of widespread PCR testing for the general population make this “the most difficult time in the pandemic” for Ontarians to gauge their personal risk level as restrictions ease.
“There’s still relatively high levels of virus circulating,” he said. “I would still be cautious.”

Full text: Licence fee cut will force Ford
to slash services
Doug Ford's billion-dollar election gimmick, Editorial, Feb. 9
The Star editorial board's take is spot on.
While Ontario car owners salivate over their potential whopping $120 annual savings, they should stop and ask themselves just how much those savings are actually going to cost them.
The debt-monster the Conservatives are always warning us about looms as large as ever, and reducing government revenue isn't going to slay it; quite the opposite. That money isn't going to be replaced on the revenue side. Instead, it will result in service cuts. Those cuts will be on the backs of the most vulnerable of our citizens, health care and education.
Let's face it: if you can afford to own, operate and maintain a car, you can afford the annual licence fee.
How does the Ministry of Transportation plan on monitoring insurance coverage? And how are unpaid fines to be collected if a renewal permit cannot be withheld?
Rob Graham, Toronto
Doug Ford may scrap renewal fees for Ontario licence plates, Feb. 7
Scrapping the licence plate renewal fee will not earn my vote, Premier Doug Ford.
Why not announce you are redirecting that revenue to improve health care, help for the homeless or provide affordable retirement care for seniors? I'm pretty sure that would win you more votes than eliminating a fee very few complain about.
M. Power, St. George, Ont.
COVID test kits should be mailed to all homes
One day last week I heard there were COVID testing kits at my local pharmacy. So I walked down there a couple hours later, but there were none left.
I am 75 years old and am not on social media to know how to get to a location before the hordes descend. So how does someone like myself get a kit?
It seems to me this distribution process is unfair to many persons, not just seniors - anyone without a car or with a disability or not on social media constantly.
I have tried to buy them, but they are not available because the supply has been given to governments who have bought up the supply.
Why not give one COVID test kit per household via mail, then at least every household would get one. Those with school-aged children could be given extra via school distribution.
I did ask at the pharmacy if I could put my name on a list so when the next shipment arrived, I could be assured of a kit. But the pharmacy wouldn't do it.
Dianne Ness, Toronto
Security lacking on TTC subways
TTC employee stabbed at Dupont station, Feb. 9
The TTC needs to step up security on its subways, as they are very obviously becoming increasingly dangerous.
And I am not talking about ticketing fare evaders, I'm talking about two security people per train capable of frog-marching someone off TTC property into the hands of the police, who can then assess what to do with them.
Since I started taking the TTC on weekends recently, I have witnessed numerous homeless people in clear mental crisis or drug impaired, or both, in various stages of rage. I've seen the terror in passengers' eyes behind their masks as they've been verbally harassed.
No one deserves this kind of treatment on a public service, or anywhere for that matter. I do understand these people need help, but they aren't going to get that stumbling around the subway.
I've personally intervened on occasion and it's not pleasant, but when you see someone who is being harassed you step up.
Richard Kadziewicz,
Scarborough

The debt-monster the Conservatives are always warning us about looms as large as ever, and reducing government revenue isn’t going to slay it; quite the opposite.

On another note, how does the Ministry of Transportation plan on monitoring insurance coverage? And how are unpaid fines to be collected if a renewal permit cannot be withheld?
As is all too common with Ontario’s inept ruling government, this plan has not been thought through.

Full text: Barely two years ago, Jean Charest ruled out a run for the federal Conservative leadership because he could not see a path to victory. Now the former Quebec premier is once again seriously considering a bid, with a decision apparently to come over the next week or so. What changed?
In a replay of the scenario that attended Andrew Scheer's resignation at the end of 2019, Charest's name predictably resurfaced on the list of possible successors to Erin O'Toole almost as soon as the latter was ousted from the leadership. His phone has been ringing off the hook.
But the difference this time is the people who are doing the calling.
Two years ago, many of those who were pushing Charest to run were former supporters, as often as not long-time associates from the Brian Mulroney era and the bygone days of the Progressive Conservative party.
Within the more recent ranks of the Conservative party, enthusiasm for a Charest bid was at best tepid.
Back then, for instance, the former premier could not persuade then-Quebec lieutenant Alain Rayes - along with other Quebec MPs - to back his bid.
Instead Rayes opted to sit out the campaign.
At the same time, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, then the leading provincial voice within the Canadian conservative movement, made it clear he would use his significant influence to keep Charest (and others like him, such as Peter MacKay) from taking the helm.
Stephen Harper would not give the former premier his blessing.
But since then, Kenney's star has faded. As he fights for his political life in Alberta, he is no longer in a position to play the larger leadership role that was once his. And while Harper remains a force within the party, time out of office has also taken a toll on his influence.
For his part, Rayes is all in this time. Earlier this week he resigned his caucus post, the better to participate in the leadership battle. He says he is looking for a fiscally conservative but socially progressive leader. He has been speaking with Charest. By all indications, he would be willing to play a leading role in his leadership campaign.
At the same time, a movement to elect a leader liable to champion a serious climate change agenda is afoot.
This week, former deputy leader Lisa Raitt announced she was spearheading a Conservative group committed to ensuring that the next leader brings a comprehensive climate change policy to party members.
As a former federal environment minister and as one of the first premiers to introduce carbon pricing in his province, Charest has a climate change track record few Conservatives can match these days.
From the perspective of those looking for a strong candidate with credible climate change credentials and/or a more progressive outlook, the stakes in this leadership campaign are higher than in 2020.
With MacKay and O'Toole as the main contenders in that battle, the many Conservatives who believed the party needed to carve a more centrist path to power assumed that one way or another, they would end up with a like-minded leader. Rather than concentrate their forces behind one or the other, they dispersed in the two camps.
But with Ottawa MP Pierre Poilievre as the perceived front-runner, the outlook could not be more different and the divide starker.
For the many Conservatives who supported O'Toole's efforts to recast the party along more mainstream lines, the scorched earth brand of conservatism Poilievre practises is a non-starter.
They feel his disdain for carbon pricing, his visceral opposition to a child-care social policy along the lines of Quebec's popular program and, more recently, his flirtation with the convoy that has blockaded the federal capital along with strategic border points will make the party less rather than more attractive to mainstream voters.
They are looking for someone strong enough to beat him. In many Conservative minds, the upcoming battle is one for the soul of the party.
It is an open secret that Charest has always harboured prime ministerial ambitions. His first leadership run dates back almost 30 years to 1993. Even over his three-term tenure as premier, he continued to long for the federal pastures.
At the same time, Justin Trudeau leads a third-term government that is increasingly acting its age in the lethargic sense of the word.
All week, the prime minister and his team struggled to project the kind of energy voters would expect from a government in crisis management mode.
These days, it is easier to see a path to ousting the Liberals from office in the next election than it was two years ago, especially if they are to be led by an increasingly disengaged leader. From Charest's perspective, that makes for an even stronger temptation to run.

Full text: Doug Ford forgets
'the little guy' in his vote-buying plot
Rivals slam Ford's licence plate plan, Feb. 9
Ford long ago cancelled the electric vehicle (EV) rebate. He also stated that he did not want to give "rebates to guys that are buying $100,000-cars - "millionaires," while ignoring both the environmental benefits and benefits to Ontario automotive manufacturers and parts makers. Now he wants to eliminate the cost of renewing licence plates.
Lost in both of these decisions is any benefit to help the "little guy," those of us who do not own cars.
What I see is a blatant vote-buying tactic at the expense of the taxpayer and the "little guy," for whom he purports to fight.
Marsha Laing, Toronto
Scrapping licence stickers a bad idea for many reasons
Ford wants to scrap licence plate stickers, Feb. 8
Eliminating vehicle registration fees and renewal stickers is a bad idea for a number of reasons:
There will be a continual loss of more than $1 billion per annum in tax revenues for provincial coffers.
Without the requirement to renew vehicle registrations annually, or biannually, vehicle owners will not be inclined to notify the Ministry of Transportation of a change of address, notwithstanding that the Highway Traffic Act requires that this be done within six days of a change in residence.
The Federal Department of Transport relies on this up-to-date address information to send out safety recall notices to vehicle owners. The provincial government will still have to issue some form of renewal evidence to truck and bus registrants for enforcement purposes of annual registration fees.
Privately run Service Ontario offices rely on renewal fee commissions as a significant portion of their revenues.
If the government truly wishes to cut costs for voters (vehicle registrants), why not just reduce the annual registration fee for vehicle owners and perhaps driver renewal fees as well?
Robert Domoney, Richmond Hill
Plan to forgo revenue will have consequences
Ford wants to scrap licence plate stickers, Feb. 8
For anyone who drives a car in Ontario, paying $10 a month for a licence sticker is negligible. A $1-billion shortfall in revenue is not.
How does Ford intend to make up this obscene amount? More cuts to health care, long-term care, education?
Already in a deficit position, this would be a reckless and irresponsible decision for Ontario.

Full text: A state of emergency without urgency - two weeks too late.
For too long, Doug Ford waffled and waited and watched from a distance. The premier who vowed to keep Ontario "open for business" has broken his biggest promise.
His belated declaration of emergency amounts to a declaration of defeat.
With Ottawa under occupation, he went cottaging. With the border blockaded, Ford went snowmobiling - as he confirmed Friday. With the border strangled, with Ottawa suffocating, the premier went underground. Now he has come up for air, only to clear his throat.
With the world watching and Ontarians fuming, Ford has vowed to act. The declaration is days late and $700 million a day short - a full week after an embattled Ottawa mayor made a similar declaration that did little.
There was tough talk from the premier Friday, preceded by yet more pleas - beseeching and begging the blockaders to back off. Bizarrely, Ford exhorted the extortionists to "come together" with all Ontarians.
As if law-breaking and law-abiding citizens can make common cause under a supposedly law-and-order leader. While the occupiers run circles around the police - and stay in place - the province has been brought to its knees.
"We must come together right now. We must heal the divide that is fracturing our society. We must come together now, not as opponents, but as Canadians," Ford implored.
It is the wrong tone at the wrong time for the wrongdoers. With his back against the wall, with our American trading partners reading us the riot act, the premier read from his teleprompter and importuned the protesters.
"Please go home," he repeated. " We have heard you."
In the same breath, the premier promised to "very soon remove almost all restrictions" related to the pandemic, almost apologizing for abiding by the advice of health-care experts. "I know these frustrations have reached a boiling point for many Canadians. The result is what we're now seeing in various cities across our province."
Sorry? Is society somehow to blame for this "result?"
The mixed messages from Ford to the protesters suggest he has heard them, heeds them, feels their frustrations. It raises troubling questions that Ford has yet to answer.
Yes, there may be stiff fines, but in the fullness of time. True, there could be incarceration, but with no indication of when. Perhaps there might one day be confiscation of vehicles, but in due course.
Yet no penalties or punishments can ever compensate the province for the incalculable cost incurred on Ford's watch.
The reputational damage is not merely a matter of politicians losing face or wounded pride for the police. It is not about the erosion of democratic governance and the emboldening of aspiring insurrectionists in the nation's capital.
The bottom line at the border crossing is commercial sabotage and economic bloodletting. By ransoming the Ambassador Bridge at Windsor, the blockaders have stopped $700 million in two-way trade daily - with impunity to date.
The knock-on effects were immediate: Long lines of trucks carrying just-in-time auto parts, with assembly lines shuttered when they ran out of time; truckloads of perishable foodstuffs left to rot while farmers, wholesalers, retailers and consumers bore the burden.
It is the future impact, however, that could prove far costlier. If the bridge is seen as a bottleneck in the supply chain, it will not only sever today's commercial lifeline but tomorrow's investment flows.
While Ford dithered, American political and business leaders embraced the blockage as proof of the perils of outsourcing production across the border. For it is not just the import of critical auto parts that shut down Canadian carmakers, but the export of essential materials that closed U.S. production lines - more ammunition for Buy America advocates.
How will the premier regain control of the law and order he has lost, the future cash flow he has forsaken? When will he account for his broken promise to keep Ontario "Open for Business?"
His empty campaign slogan became the law of the land when the premier enacted the "Making Ontario Open for Business Act" nearly four years ago. Billboards sprouted along the border, and the words were splashed on new license plates for commercial vehicles.
Today, the world can see for itself.
"When we say Ontario is open for business, we mean open for everybody," Ford boasted back then.
Now it's open for nobody.
Ford is not the only leader to lapse into bromides. But he bears the greatest responsibility for the fate of Ontarians.
Ottawa's municipal politicians and police ignored the warning signs. Only Toronto Mayor John Tory has shown leadership by mobilizing public support and demanding police accountability to safeguard our streets.
But Ford cannot duck what he now calls the "illegal occupations." They fall under his ambit - both on the narrow provincial road leading to the Ambassador Bridge, and in the streets of Ontario's second-biggest city.
Even tough-talking tow truck operators have been cowed by protesters, saying they dare not clear the roads for fear of retaliation. Who then will answer the call?
There are suggestions the job might be outsourced to U.S. towing firms. What a testament to our political paralysis.
Why not call in the military's engineers and equipment operators? No, not tanks in the streets, but tow trucks to clear the streets.
Ford sought help from military medical teams when Ontario's nursing homes were overwhelmed. He should make the request for military hardware - including bulldozers if need be - to clear the roads now.
To be sure, Justin Trudeau has also dropped from the public eye (due to COVID-19 isolation, not cottaging). The prime minister could have shown more leadership, but it's not his province. Instead, we have local politicians counting on U.S. tow truck drivers to clear Ontario roads. And a premier making trails in his snowmobile while the province's main highways, byways and borders were blockaded.
That's not a declaration of emergency. It's an abdication of responsibility.

Navneet Alang: Convoy's fundraising strategies show we need to protect our digital borders

Full text: I’m not sure I ever expected a national wake-up call to come in the form of blaring horns from an 18-wheeler. But such is the situation that Canada faces currently.
The so-called “Freedom Convoy” has given this occasionally sleepy nation a rude awakening. Partly, we are coming to terms with the fact that we too are not immune to a small, hard-right minority whose definition of freedom appears to also include a freedom from responsibility. And hopefully we are also alerted to a stunning failure of state capacity: the fact that the Ottawa police and federal government are so ill-prepared that they could allow the nation’s capital to be paralyzed by an arguably illegitimate protest.
That a small group of misguided and misled Canadians might cause so much trouble will no doubt be cause for much reflection in the coming months and years. But one aspect that seems particularly troubling is that a significant portion of both the online organizing and funding appeared to come from the U.S.
It bears thinking upon — specifically, that part of Canada’s national security policy going forward has to include securing our digital borders from foreign interference.
We should be clear: the convoy itself is a Canadian phenomenon. As reported by the Globe and Mail, leaders of the convoy — Tamara Lich, Chris Barber, Benjamin Dichter — all have had connections to Canadian far-right causes and some, like Barber, have a history of sharing racist material.
That kind of prejudice, often swept under the rug, is an unfortunately persistent presence in this country.
But it’s also part of why the convoy was able to raise so much money, with its initial GoFundMe crowdsourcing more than $10 million. The company ultimately refunded that money after stating it had reason to believe the protest had become an occupation.
Of course, the convoy then continued to raise money via a different platform called GiveSendGo, which describes itself as a Christian fundraising site.
But as CTV News reports after conducting its own analysis, donations from south of the border may in fact outnumber those in Canada. This might be a Canadian protest, but it is being partially funded by Americans.
It makes a certain kind of sense. As much as the convoy is composed of Canadians, the anti-government nature of it, including the small hard-right, white nationalist components, have an American flavour to them.
The ability of foreign actors to fund quasi-seditionist movements seems like a profound problem. While platforms like GoFundMe are very often used for noble causes like helping those in need, or at the very least, stitching holes is our social safety net, the capacity to amass large amounts of money through anonymous donations is troubling.
For one, foreign influence can often have a dissonant effect on sovereign states. Canada’s far right, for example, may be given both literal and figurative support it would not enjoy without input outside our borders.
As former Green Party leader Elizabeth May put it when arguing for new laws around fundraising, “you can be not a political organization, not registered with Elections Canada but find the right kind of dog whistle and put up a GoFundMe campaign.”
It would seem that the oversight of how charitable or non-government organizations are funded needs updating for the digital age.
Like all potential regulation, it would need to balance freedoms and democratic norms with restrictions that protect those ideals.
But the awful character of the “Freedom Convoy,” not to mention the deeply unsavoury anti-social minority among its ranks, suggests that beyond Canada’s other failures, there is a need to protect digital borders from the effect of foreign money — particularly because they can import or bolster ideas that are fundamentally unCanadian.
It is an issue, however, that extends beyond the question of money. American news site Grid reported that a significant portion of popular support for the convoy on Facebook came not only from America, but through the hacked account of a Missouri woman.
Put another way: Canada’s political climate may be subject to interference not just from foreign fundraising, but social media activity.
As such, part of this country’s national security operations must now consider the state of online discourse and crowdsourcing in protecting Canadian sovereignty.
Yet, beyond that necessary legal or governmental intervention, Canadians themselves also need to be aware that they too may be being affected. Simple narratives, politicized hyperbole, and easy demonization are all mechanisms through which people are manipulated into a distorted view of this country and the world. The so-called “freedom convoy” is the wake up call that our national consciousness is easily hijacked — now it is up to us to heed the warning.

The mixed messages from Ford to the protesters suggest he has heard them, heeds them, feels their frustrations. It raises troubling questions that Ford has yet to answer.
Yes, there may be stiff fines, but in the fullness of time. True, there could be incarceration, but with no indication of when. Perhaps there might one day be confiscation of vehicles, but in due course.
Yet no penalties or punishments can ever compensate the province for the incalculable cost incurred on Ford’s watch.
The reputational damage is not merely a matter of politicians losing face or wounded pride for the police. It is not solely about the erosion of democratic governance and the emboldening of aspiring insurrectionists in the nation’s capital.
The bottom line at the border crossing is commercial sabotage and economic bloodletting. By ransoming the Ambassador Bridge at Windsor, the blockaders have stopped $700 million in two-way trade daily — with impunity to date.
The knock-on effects were immediate: Long lines of trucks carrying just-in-time auto parts, with assembly lines shuttered when they ran out of time; truckloads of perishable foodstuffs left to rot while farmers, wholesalers, retailers and consumers bore the burden.
It is the future impact, however, that could prove far costlier. If the bridge is seen as a bottleneck in the supply chain, it will not only sever today’s commercial lifeline but tomorrow’s investment flows.
While Ford dithered, American political and business leaders embraced the blockage as proof of the perils of outsourcing production across the border. For it is not just the import of critical auto parts that shut down Canadian carmakers, but the export of essential materials that closed U.S. production lines — more ammunition for Buy America advocates.
How will the premier regain control of the law and order he has lost, the future cash flow he has forsaken? When will he account for his broken promise to keep Ontario “Open for Business?”
His empty campaign slogan became the law of the land when the premier enacted the “Making Ontario Open for Business Act” nearly four years ago. Billboards sprouted along the border, and the words were splashed on new license plates for commercial vehicles.
“We are making sure … to tell the world Ontario is open for business,” the premier boasted in 2018.
Today, the world can see for itself.
“When we say Ontario is open for business, we mean open for everybody,” Ford boasted back then.
Now it’s open for nobody.
Ford is not the only leader to lapse into bromides. But he bears the greatest responsibility for the fate of Ontarians.
Ottawa’s municipal politicians and police ignored the warning signs. Only Toronto Mayor John Tory has shown leadership by mobilizing public support and demanding police accountability to safeguard our streets — if not always from snow storms, then at least from political storms.
But Ford cannot duck what he now calls the “illegal occupations.” They fall under his ambit — both on the narrow provincial road leading to the Ambassador Bridge, and in the streets of Ontario’s second-biggest city.
Even tough-talking tow truck operators have been cowed by protesters, saying they dare not clear the roads for fear of retaliation. Who then will answer the call?
There are suggestions the job might be outsourced to U.S. towing firms. What a testament to our political paralysis.
Why not call in the military’s engineers and equipment operators? No, not tanks in the streets, but tow trucks to clear the streets.
Ford sought help from military medical teams when Ontario’s nursing homes were overwhelmed. He should make the request for military hardware — including bulldozers if need be — to clear the roads now.
To be sure, Justin Trudeau has also dropped from the public eye (due to COVID-19 isolation, not cottaging). The prime minister could have shown more leadership, but it’s not his province — the onus is on Ford to first seek help from the federal government before it can answer the call.
Instead, we have local politicians counting on American tow truck drivers to clear Ontario roads. And we have a premier making trails in his snowmobile while the province’s main highways, byways and borders were blockaded.
That’s not a declaration of emergency. It’s an abdication of responsibility.

Full text: As Toronto braces for the potential of a second weekend of truck convoy protests, the city’s top cop said police have had to scrutinize intelligence about protestors’ next moves in the face of a “deliberate” misinformation campaign.
“It is an organized group of people that are trying to make it difficult for police agencies across the province. We believe some of them are deliberately trying to tax our resources,” Toronto police chief James Ramer said Friday.
“So we have to weigh all the information the best we can.”
Nonetheless, in response to intelligence about the moves of the so-called “Freedom Convoy,” Ramer said there is a “very robust” policing plan in place as the movement, which began with truckers protesting COVID-19 vaccine mandates, is expected to descend on Toronto this weekend.
Ramer would not provide details about how many protestors or trucks could be arriving in the city but said the force is preparing for every eventuality and taking an “all hands on deck approach” when it comes to staffing.
“We have a very robust plan that is very nimble and allows us to scale up or scale down whatever is required,” Ramer said at a news conference, held with Toronto Mayor John Tory.
“We all want to do everything we can — absolutely everything we can — to try and avoid the situations that we’re seeing in Ottawa and in Windsor,” Tory said.
Ramer said there will once again be a large police presence in the downtown core and road closures on major downtown streets; Queen’s Park Circle from College Street to Bloor Street has been closed since Wednesday and officers have since blocked off College between Bay Street and Yonge Street.
Asked what Toronto police will do if protestors park vehicles in the city and refuse to leave, Ramer said: “We’re going to help them leave.”
“If vehicles are engaged and they’re not moving, we’re going to move them out of the way,” Ramer said, later adding Toronto police tow trucks are ready to be put to use if necessary.
Ramer and Tory’s comments came hours after Ontario Premier Doug Ford declared a state of emergency in response to what he called the “siege” of Ottawa and a days-long blockade at the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor, which accounts for one-quarter of trade between Canada and the U.S.
Stating that governments do not direct police but “we do set the laws,” Ford announced the province would be urgently enacting orders bringing in fines of up to $100,000 or a year in jail for blocking the movement of goods, services and people along critical routes. Ford also said the province will provide the temporary legal authority to take away personal and commercial licenses of anyone who doesn’t comply with orders.
Ramer said the emergency declaration and its strengthened police powers are being carefully reviewed and the service will be providing updates to officers on what that means for this weekend’s operation.
On Friday afternoon, Tory thanked Ford for declaring the emergency, stating the premier made it “extremely clear that it is time for these illegal occupations to end and for people to go home.”
Earlier this week, Toronto police closed off Queen’s Park Circle amid online rumours from Freedom Convoy organizers that they would move from Ottawa to Toronto. Later Wednesday, as it became clear the convoy was not descending en masse in the city, organizer Chris Barber, a truck driver and organizer, said the comments were uttered as a “game.”
On Thursday, Ottawa police chief Peter Sloly said that his city’s 911 phone system had been flooded with false calls, many of them coming from the United States.
Asked Friday where police were predominantly getting information from social media, Ramer said there was an “elaborate” intelligence operation in place.
“We have a very elaborate and robust intelligence operation that incorporates all the agencies within that province, at both the municipal provincial and federal level,” he said.
On Thursday, the Toronto police board held an emergency closed-door meeting to discuss the force’s plan heading into an anticipated second weekend of convoy protests. The rare special meeting was held under a little-used section of Ontario’s Police Service Act that allows for confidential meetings to be held in order to discuss public security matters.
Before a city council budget meeting, Tory, who sits on the civilian police board, stressed that he is aware of everyone’s right to protest but said there must be respect for everybody’s rights — “people shouldn’t have to, because someone is exercising their rights, worry then about their own right to go to work, or their own right to be safe, or their own right to get to the doctor’s (office).”
Last weekend, in advance of anticipated protests at Queen’s Park , Toronto police used cruisers and buses to close off two major stretches of the downtown core — parts of University Avenue and College Street — to protect Toronto’s hospital row. Police also said there would be a “large police presence” downtown and that additional CCTV cameras would be installed.
The protests and ensuing counterprotests remained mostly peaceful throughout the weekend, though the demonstrations caused traffic delays.
Asked if police are taking into consideration the possibility that protestors may have studied what officers did last weekend, and adapted their tactics, Ramer said: “We have better planners.”
“And that’s precisely what’s involved. We have a very robust plan and some good people,” he said.

We must protect digital borders

Full text: I'm not sure I ever expected a national wake-up call to come in the form of blaring horns from an 18-wheeler. But such is the situation that Canada faces currently.
The so-called "Freedom Convoy" has given this occasionally sleepy nation a rude awakening. Partly, we are coming to terms with the fact that we, too, are not immune to a small, hard-right minority whose definition of freedom appears to also include a freedom from responsibility. And hopefully we are also alerted to a stunning failure of state capacity: the fact that the Ottawa police and federal government are so ill-prepared that they could allow the nation's capital to be paralyzed by an arguably illegitimate protest.
That a small group of misguided and misled Canadians might cause so much trouble will no doubt be cause for much reflection in the coming months and years. But one aspect that seems particularly troubling is that a significant portion of both the online organizing and funding appeared to come from the U.S.
It bears thinking upon - specifically, that part of Canada's national security policy going forward has to include securing our digital borders from foreign interference.
We should be clear: The convoy itself is a Canadian phenomenon. As reported by the Globe and Mail, leaders of the convoy - Tamara Lich, Chris Barber, Benjamin Dichter - all have had connections to Canadian far-right causes and some, like Barber, have a history of sharing racist material.
That kind of prejudice, often swept under the rug, is an unfortunately persistent presence in this country.
But it's also part of why the convoy was able to raise so much money, with its initial GoFundMe crowdsourcing more than $10 million. The company ultimately refunded that money after stating it had reason to believe the protest had become an occupation.
Of course, the convoy then continued to raise money via a different platform called GiveSendGo, which describes itself as a Christian fundraising site.
But as CTV News reports after conducting its own analysis, donations from south of the border may in fact outnumber those in Canada. This might be a Canadian protest, but it is being partially funded by Americans.
It makes a certain kind of sense. As much as the convoy is composed of Canadians, the anti-government nature of it, including the small hard-right, white nationalist components, have an American flavour to them.
The ability of foreign actors to fund quasi-seditionist movements seems like a profound problem. While platforms like GoFundMe are very often used for noble causes like helping those in need, or at the very least, stitching holes is our social safety net, the capacity to amass large amounts of money through anonymous donations is troubling.
For one, foreign influence can often have a dissonant effect on sovereign states. Canada's far right, for example, may be given both literal and figurative support it would not enjoy without input outside our borders.
As former Green Party leader Elizabeth May put it when arguing for new laws around fundraising, "you can be not a political organization, not registered with Elections Canada but find the right kind of dog whistle and put up a GoFundMe campaign."
It would seem that the oversight of how charitable or non-government organizations are funded needs updating for the digital age.
Like all potential regulation, it would need to balance freedoms and democratic norms with restrictions that protect those ideals.
But the awful character of the "Freedom Convoy," not to mention the deeply unsavoury anti-social minority among its ranks, suggests that beyond Canada's other failures, there is a need to protect digital borders from the effect of foreign money - particularly because they can import or bolster ideas that are fundamentally unCanadian.
It is an issue, however, that extends beyond the question of money. American news site Grid reported that a significant portion of popular support for the convoy on Facebook came not only from America, but through the hacked account of a Missouri woman.
Put another way: Canada's political climate may be subject to interference not just from foreign fundraising, but social media activity.
As such, part of this country's national security operations must now consider the state of online discourse and crowdsourcing in protecting Canadian sovereignty.
Yet, beyond that necessary legal or governmental intervention, Canadians themselves also need to be aware that they too may be being affected. Simple narratives, politicized hyperbole, and easy demonization are all mechanisms through which people are manipulated into a distorted view of this country and the world. The so-called "freedom convoy" is the wake up call that our national consciousness is easily hijacked - now it is up to us to heed the warning.

Conservative leadership race reopens internal debate about carbon pricing

Full text: OTTAWA — Signing a pledge to scrap the federal “carbon tax” used to be a rite of political passage for would-be Conservative party leaders.
Now, a group of leading Conservatives wants the next round of contenders to sign on to a new way of thinking: that without a credible climate change plan, the party can’t win enough seats to form a government.
“If everything is always about the carbon tax, we are not going to push forward,” said former Conservative cabinet minister and one-time leadership hopeful Lisa Raitt, who is part of Conservatives for Clean Growth.
“It’s much bigger than that.”
The group launched this week to help shape the debate during the upcoming leadership race by helping candidates put together ideas on how a Conservative government could get Canada to net-zero carbon emissions.
That doesn’t necessarily mean embracing a carbon tax, said Ken Boessenkool, executive director of the group and former policy adviser to prime minister Stephen Harper.
Some Conservatives believe in carbon pricing, others want to focus on regulation or incentives. The point of their group, he said, is to help each candidate figure out a plan that works.
“I don’t think those plans need to be the same and that’s fine,” he said.
“There are many pathways to get to the objective, the important thing is that we have a credible pathway to get to net-zero.”
The Conservatives have long struggled with crafting climate change policy that passes muster with both their base and the larger voting public.
“Anybody who tells you that a carbon tax is an environmental policy is trying to pull the wool over your eyes,” Harper said during the 2015 election campaign , which the Liberals won while promising to put a price on carbon.
In the Conservatives’ 2017 leadership race, MP Michael Chong ran on a platform that advocated for carbon pricing, arguing that using a market-based mechanism was the most Conservative approach to the issue.
He was the only contestant in a crowded field to do so, and was regularly heckled for suggesting the idea.
That race was won by Andrew Scheer, who subsequently made a promise to kill the Liberal carbon levy a central plank in the party’s 2019 election platform.
Scheer picked up seats for the Tories in that campaign, but many candidates — including Raitt — said they couldn’t hold or win ridings around Canada’s major cities without being able to propose a viable alternative.
As party leader, Erin O’Toole tried a different approach in the 2021 election campaign.
He ran on a platform that included a consumer price on carbon, a policy unveiled just after the party’s grassroots had voted down a motion to insert the phrase “climate change is real” into their official policy declaration.
O’Toole told the Conservatives his idea was the only way to break through in ridings they needed to win in order to form a majority government.
But during his own leadership race, O’Toole had signed the Canadian Taxpayers Federation’s pledge to cancel the federal carbon pricing program.
While his proposal did pledge to end the federal levy put in place by the Liberals — money collected under his plan would instead flow into savings accounts that Canadians could use to buy environmentally friendly products — it was still seen as a broken promise.
The issue would dog O’Toole for months, one in a list of perceived flip-flops that preceded his ouster as leader last week. Many MPs pointed out his plan still didn’t give the party the breakthrough he’d promised.
In the wake of his dismissal, the Star learned, interim party leader Candice Bergen has told MPs they’re going back to basics.
For now, the Tories will revert to their policy declaration that there should be no federally imposed system of carbon pricing or cap-and-trade program.
What Conservatives might adopt next, she said, needs to be hashed out during their upcoming leadership race.
The race currently has but one contestant, longtime Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre.
While he’s made crystal clear his disdain for carbon pricing, Poilievre’s broader views on the environment and climate change are less clear.
“I’m hopeful that he will see the importance of developing a credible climate plan, as I hope every other entrant into the race feels it important to have a credible climate plan,” Boessenkool said.
Another potential leadership contender said she welcomes the formation of Conservatives for Clean Growth.
“Conservatives need to contribute to the climate conversation,” Tasha Kheiriddin, a longtime Conservative political strategist, wrote on social media.
“Look forward to hearing what the CCG has to say.”

Full text: For Ontario NDP Leader Andrea Horwath, it doesn’t get any better.
At a mandatory leadership review Sunday, fellow New Democrats gave her a ringing 85 per cent endorsement — her best ever. The party is in the best shape since she became leader 13 years ago, boasting 40 seats and brimming with money, she reassured delegates.
But it better get better by June 2. That’s when all Ontario voters render their verdict in the coming election.
Now Canada’s longest-serving party leader, Horwath predicted she’ll finally be sitting in the premier’s office post-election. In her weekend pitch for support, Horwath rattled off the sins of Doug Ford’s Progressive Conservative government and lambasted the legacy of the last Liberal dynasty.
“My friends, let me say it loud and clear: On June 2, I’m confident we will get it done!” Horwath told party delegates listening in via Zoom.
What she didn’t explain is why, if Ford is so hapless a premier, and the Liberals so lamentable, so many people still prefer them to the NDP? Despite Horwath’s bravado about the 2018 seat count, the reality is that the party is not where it needs to be on the eve of the 2022 election.
After four years in power, and two years of pandemic, Ford is in first place in most public opinion polls. The Liberals and New Democrats keep fighting for second, trading places monthly.
Put another way, the odds of Ford winning the most seats are 92 per cent, according to a Feb. 2 analysis by 338canada.com , the respected online survey of surveys. The Liberals have only a seven per cent chance of coming out on top.
The NDP’s prospects? Its chances of beating out the Tories for first place show up as zero per cent, according to the analysis.
What’s holding Horwath back? It is conventional wisdom, at NDP conventions, that their leader is the most popular politician in Ontario.
In fact, last month’s Leger poll puts her popularity at roughly the same as Ford’s: The premier’s “favourable” rating is 38 per cent, versus 40 for Horwath — a statistical tie.
Unsurprisingly, Ford’s unfavourable number is higher at 56 per cent. And yet fully 42 per cent of voters gave Horwath an unfavourable rating — leaving her, too, in negative territory in the popularity sweepstakes.
( Leger pegs the party standings at about the same as most other polls over the past year — Tories leading at 37 per cent, with the Liberals and NDP at 27 and 26 per cent, respectively.)
Why has Horwath-mania not come to Ontario? After all, NDP delegates keep voting for her to stay on — Sunday’s 85 per cent is an improvement over the 76 per cent she got from party stalwarts a decade ago.
Her Liberal rival, Steven Del Duca has lower popularity ratings and name recognition, and has yet to put forward any major policy planks. Yet after only two years as leader, he is on track to win more seats, according to the projections.
Part of it is presumably the brand. While Horwath was preaching to the NDP converted on the weekend, Del Duca was cheerfully pitching to a meeting of the federal Liberals’ Ontario wing, hoping to profit from the national party’s continuing grip on the province.
The different strategies are instructive. Del Duca focused on Ford’s bungling with a promise to replace it with “competent” leadership — all the while ignoring the NDP.
Horwath, by contrast, devoted almost as much time to attacking the Liberals as she did the Tories — making the case that Ford was not entirely at fault because he inherited a mess from Del Duca’s Liberals.
“It would be easy … to lay the blame just at Doug Ford’s feet,” she mused, preparing to pivot. “Which brings me to Steven Del Duca and his Liberals.”
Mocking his claim that Ontario needs a “competent” premier, Horwath countered: “Between 2003 and 2018 … you were sitting at the Liberal government’s cabinet table” (Del Duca was a minister from 2014-18).
With the “social democratic solutions only New Democrats offer,” she exhorted, “we must win the election.”
Horwath’s targeting of Del Duca is a recurring crutch. In attack ads last year, the NDP showed an unflattering clip of the Liberal leader blinking into the camera while tying him to former premier Kathleen Wynne.
The strategy is to assign blame equally between Tories and Liberals, with the NDP blameless and virtuous. More to the point, it casts the current premier and his predecessor (Ford and Wynne — and by extension Del Duca) as two sides of the same coin — Tweedledee and Tweedledum.
That’s the phrase the NDP relied on in previous campaigns against its old rivals. Sometimes it works, most times it doesn’t.
So far it hasn’t got Horwath where she needs to get by June 2. For better or for worse.
In a column last month I mentioned that the latest NDP attack ad shows Del Duca blinking in slow motion. The NDP assures me it did not tinker with Del Duca’s blink rate. The Liberals say the clip is pulled from the start of a Zoom event while their leader was waiting for his cue to talk, but the NDP counters that all’s fair in the public domain.
Mea culpa, but I still think the NDP is culpable in its own way. The clip is undistorted but it’s undignified. It’s not manipulated but it’s manipulative. If I was thrown off by the ad’s conspicuous flicker and misstated the frame rate, it’s because I’m always suspicious of dubious attack ads that “frame” political rivals.

Full text: Pressure is mounting on police and political leaders to take action to end the trucker protests jamming the nation's capital and border traffic at three Canada-U.S. entry points.
But Ottawa's top cop said breaking up the protests is no simple task, describing the so-called Freedom Convoy as a "sophisticated" operation able to run provincial- and national-level campaigns.
"This is an unprecedented demonstration. It has significant levels of fundraising, co-ordination and communication. They have command centres established here and across the country and beyond this country," Ottawa police Chief Peter Sloly told reporters Thursday, adding that Canada's national security agencies have backed that assessment.
The Ottawa police increased their presence on the main roadway in front of Parliament Hill late Thursday, as the Ontario government moved to freeze the flow of money from one of the convoy's primary fundraising channels, the U.S.-based Christian crowdfunding platform GiveSendGo.
Ontario's attorney general brought an application to the Superior Court of Justice seeking an order that would block anyone from "disposing of, or otherwise dealing with ... any and all monetary donations made through the Freedom Convoy 2022 and Adopt-a-Trucker campaign pages" on the platform.
"This afternoon, the order was issued. It binds any and all parties with possession or control over these donations," said Ivana Yelich, a spokesperson for Premier Doug Ford.
Effectively, it freezes the spending of the funds raised.
The campaigns have together amassed more than $9 million (U.S.) to fuel, feed and house demonstrators who have gridlocked downtown Ottawa for two weeks to protest COVID-19 mandates and restrictions. Convoy organizers turned to GiveSendGo, the new platform, after crowdfunding site GoFundMe last week yanked the protest's original fundraiser from its website.
Late Thursday, GiveSendGo tweeted a statement in response to the Ontario court order, defiantly challenging the Canadian court's ability to touch its funds or their intended destination.
"Canada has absolutely ZERO jurisdiction over how we manage our funds here at GiveSendGo. All funds for EVERY campaign on GiveSendGo flow directly to the recipients of those campaigns, not least of which is The Freedom Convoy campaign," the organization said on Twitter.
Police cleared more than a dozen trucks but hundreds still clogged downtown Ottawa streets Thursday as Michigan's governor called on Canada to end the protest now jamming critical cross-border traffic between Windsor and Detroit.
In a statement posted on Twitter, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called for a quick resolution to the ongoing closure of the Ambassador Bridge.
"It is imperative that Canadian local, provincial and national governments de-escalate this economic blockade," Whitmer said. "They must take all necessary and appropriate steps to immediately and safely reopen traffic so we can continue growing our economy."
But Canadian governments argue their hands are tied because a basic tenet of democracy is that politicians cannot direct police operations. That leaves lawmakers on this side of the border urging protesters to leave and chiding political opponents.
As the crisis built Tuesday night, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to Premier Doug Ford by phone. Ford spoke to other federal ministers late Wednesday as the stoppage at Windsor-Detroit choked key supply chains, leading to shift cancellations by at least three major car manufacturers in Ontario.
However, the Ontario government has declined to participate in the federal government's proposed trilateral discussion table on the convoy response.
The provincial government sees no use "in another meeting where a table of politicians are sitting around really not able to accomplish anything, because this is ... a policing matter," said Yelich, the Ford spokesperson.
"There's nothing Justin Trudeau can do, really, at this time, and there's nothing that Doug Ford can do," said Yelich.
"We need the police to enforce the law."
The Windsor-Detroit border blockade is clearly "illegal," Yelich said, and "the police are the ones that will have to enforce the laws that are being broken there."
Sloly on Thursday warned other demonstrators against coming to Ottawa this weekend.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Ontario Provincial Police are sending help in addition to the 250 Mounties already deployed, although Sloly could not say how many more. He said several forces from the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area are dispatching additional "public order units" - or riot squads - to bolster Ottawa's force.
"With more resources, we'll get more results and a safer end to this unlawful demonstration," he said. "It's been incredibly difficult."
Sloly said some towing companies have refused to help police operations, and some tow-truck operators have reported being threatened.
Ottawa police will continue to "harden" their response in the downtown core, Sloly said, after they "negotiated" the departure of 12 trucks from a staging area near an Ottawa baseball stadium and 10 others from downtown. He said his officers have issued 1,700 tickets, made 25 arrests and laid criminal charges, and that another 126 "active investigations" were underway.
Sloly said the policing operation has cost up to $800,000 a day, and that expense will increase as more officers arrive.
Trudeau and his top ministers have repeatedly said that politicians' options are limited, and that the federal government will not direct any police operations, but would ensure Ottawa and Windsor have all the resources they need.
A senior federal government source, speaking on condition they not be identified, said federal and provincial ministers have been communicating with their counterparts and municipal leaders, but that more co-ordination is needed between the three levels of government.
The official expressed cautious optimism that Ontario will soon provide more OPP officers in Windsor.
In the House of Commons on Thursday, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh demanded the prime minister "stop hiding behind jurisdiction and fix this mess."
The truckers' protests have also spread to major cities including Quebec City, Winnipeg and Toronto, and border crossings in Alberta and Manitoba.
The Ambassador Bridge is a key route in the cross-border transportation of auto parts, medical supplies, manufactured goods and fresh produce. Thousands of trucks have been diverted to another border crossing in Sarnia, which is struggling to cope with the increased traffic.
The federal government continues to insist that it won't give into demands that it immediately drop COVID-19 vaccination mandates for international truckers. It has noted many pandemic restrictions, such as masking and business capacity limits, fall under provincial jurisdiction, and maintain that controlling the protests is a local policing matter.
The RCMP has jurisdiction to handle the Alberta and Manitoba border protests, but only because it operates in those provinces under contract to the provincial government.
The federal Conservatives, whose interim leader and prominent MPs have supported the convoy protesters and argued Trudeau should grant their demands to drop mandates, reversed course on Thursday, saying it's time for the protesters to go home because of the economic damage they have caused.
On Parliament Hill, the trucks, SUVs and pickups jamming major downtown routes remained, sprawled across several city blocks.
Police reiterated a warning issued Wednesday that under the offence known as "mischief to property," protesters could be arrested without warrant, see their vehicles seized and possibly forfeited, and be barred from crossing into the U.S. if charged or convicted.
Police also warned of a "concerted effort" to inundate its 911 and non-emergency policing reporting line with illegitimate calls.
"This endangers lives and is completely unacceptable," the police service posted on Twitter. "We track calls and will charge anyone deliberately interfering with emergencies."
Early Thursday morning, around "60 to 70 light trucks" slowly circled the Ottawa International Airport, according to a statement from the airport. A spokesperson said the protesters left about two hours later.

A billion for re-election

Full text: For all the clamour and din, the ungodly honking and harassment, the bizarre ranting by the aggrieved that has seized public discourse of late, one complaint rarely heard was that Ontario's licence plate renewal stickers were an intolerable affront.
Yet, as the Star's Robert Benzie reported this week, we have the visionary government of Premier Doug Ford floating the prospect of scrapping them and saving drivers in the province up to $120 annually.
Now, no rational Ontarian would complain about saving money.
And the proposal is entirely on-brand for the buck-a-beer premier who has made great political hay from the large dividends he has cashed from modest gestures.
But the plan really makes sense on only one level. And that would be the Ford government's re-election prospects in its scheduled consultation with voters this June.
It is, not to put too fine a point on it, bald-faced pandering.
While the amount is relatively small beer to individuals - and would cover a couple of tanks of gas or a few cases from The Beer Store - it adds up to more than $1 billion forgone by the provincial treasury.
And that amount comes at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has sent deficits of all governments soaring and when justified demands from key sectors for much-needed help is soaring.
As the Star reported, the idea was well-received by cabinet ministers when they were told of it this week. No kidding.
And it is expected to be introduced through legislation this spring and be in place before the election. What timing.
What it basically amounts to is siphoning a billion dollars out of public accounts to spend on the Ford government's re-election bid.
That campaign - because of the premier's uneven response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and his near-invisible response to the civil disobedience of anti-vaccine protesters - will be built on small-bore pocketbook issues of which this proposal is one.
It also plays to Ford's favourite demographic - motorists.
While it would certainly be nice to save $120, that amount per year will change very few lives.
Forfeiting the treasury's $1 billion, however, might result in fewer nurses, inadequate mental health services, more harm to those experiencing homelessness - or any number of benefits sacrificed so the premier can play his preferred role as this season's political Easter bunny, bringing goodies to anything on four wheels.
Under the reported plan, which would affect 8.5 million vehicles in Ontario, annual fees ranging from $12 for mopeds to $120 for passenger vehicles would be scrapped. Drivers would still pay a one-time fee of about $20 for a new licence plate.
The obligation of a provincial leader is to look at the big picture and take the long view - not the shovelling of a few spadefuls of snow, or the doling out of what amounts to nickels and dimes.
New Democrat Jennifer French told Benzie the bottom line for Ontarians is that the cost of living in Ontario has ballooned on everything from gas to groceries under Ford's watch.
The premier should be focused, she said, on addressing big-ticket issues such as housing, hydro and child-care costs.
To be sure, it's an odd state of affairs when the twin obsessions of a premier seem to be licence plates and beer prices.
Then again, few would claim the current era has produced what future history books will regard as the golden age of political leadership.

Full text: The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Thursday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available .
7:05 p.m. British Columbia health officials are reporting five new deaths due to COVID-19 bringing the total fatalities in the province to 2,730, reports The Canadian Press.
A news release Thursday says the province reported 1,318 new cases of the virus, although officials have said this number is likely much higher, because B.C. has reached its testing capacity, according to CP.
Officials say they will no longer provide the number of active cases or those who are out of isolation.
They say the number of people in hospital with COVID-19 is 867, a drop from 985 last Thursday, while 138 people are in intensive care.
They say 90.4 per cent of those eligible aged 12 and older have had two shots of a vaccine, while 51.1 per cent of those have also had a booster dose.
Provincial health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, has said all regulated health workers including dentists, pharmacists, doctors and chiropractors will be required to have their first shot of a COVID-19 vaccine by March 24 and the second dose within 35 days.
5:45 p.m. The Ontario government says it has successfully petitioned a court to freeze access to millions of dollars donated through online fundraising platform GiveSendGo to the truckers convoy protesting COVID-19 restrictions in Ottawa and at several border crossings, reports The Canadian Press.
A spokeswoman for Premier Doug Ford says Ontario’s attorney general brought the application to the Superior Court of Justice seeking an order that would prohibit anyone from distributing donations made through the website’s “Freedom Convoy 2022” and “Adopt-a-Trucker” campaign pages, according to CP.
Spokeswoman Ivana Yelich says an order binding “any and all parties with possession or control over these donations” was issued today.
Hundreds of semi-trucks rolled into downtown Ottawa two weeks ago to protest COVID-19 vaccine mandates and health restrictions and now trucks are also blockading border crossings in Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario.
Donors initially raised more than $10 million through GoFundMe, which announced last Friday it was pulling the plug on the campaign and that the money would be refunded.
Convoy organizers quickly set up a new campaign on Christian fundraising site GiveSendGo, which had raised US$8.2 million by today.
4:44 p.m. Quebec’s opposition parties are accusing the government of taking too long to give up COVID-19 emergency powers and they say the delay is helping Premier François Legault and his ministers avoid scrutiny, reports The Canadian Press.
Earlier this week, the government renewed the state of emergency. Legault told reporters the emergency order would only be lifted once a bill is passed allowing the government to keep some powers, such as the ability to impose the vaccine passport system and mask mandates, according to CP.
Opposition parties, however, say the government should end the state of emergency and have a debate in the legislature about what measures should remain.
Liberal health critic Monsef Derraji said the government uses ministerial decrees too often.
“It’s the wrong way to govern,” Derraji said in an interview Thursday.
Health Minister Christian Dubé has said he would introduce a bill in March to lift the state of emergency, but he has also said it would be up to the opposition as to whether the legislation passes before June.
Derraji said he’s concerned the state of emergency won’t be lifted in time to ensure the government is held to account on its pandemic spending before Quebecers head to the polls.
Quebec reported 35 more deaths linked to COVID-19 on Thursday and 36 fewer hospitalizations.
The Health Department said there were 2,312 COVID-19 hospitalizations, after 193 people were admitted to hospital in the past 24 hours and 229 people were discharged. It said 173 people were in intensive care, an increase of two from the day before.
4:34 p.m. The Ontario government says it has successfully petitioned a court to freeze access to millions of dollars in donations to the truckers convoy that were raised through online platform GiveSendGo, reports The Canadian Press.
A spokeswoman for Premier Doug Ford says Ontario’s attorney general brought the application to the Superior Court of Justice and an order binding “any and all parties with possession or control over these donations” was issued today, according to CP.
4 p.m. An Ontario Superior Court justice has delayed hearing an application for an injunction that would stop protesters blocking Canada-bound traffic at the Ambassador Bridge border crossing in Windsor.
Chief Justice Geoffrey Morawetz says he understands that the matter is urgent, but the application is “serious in nature” and the defendants should be given the chance to make their case.
He also granted the City of Windsor intervener status in the injunction application, which was brought by the Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association.
Morawetz says he will hear submissions tomorrow at noon.
The mayor of Windsor, Ont., says the situation at the Ambassador Bridge is an occupation and it must end.
Dilkens also says anyone who may wish to join the protest is not welcome in his city.
3:55 p.m. Ontario’s top doctor says he’s reviewing timelines for Ontario’s reopening plan and all other COVID-19 measures now that a massive wave of Omicron variant cases is receding, reports The Canadian Press.
Dr. Kieran Moore says the Omicron wave has peaked and it’s time to focus on resuming other activities in the health system and society at large, according to CP.
Now that hospitalizations, intensive care admissions and other virus indicators are improving, the province is lifting a directive that paused all surgeries deemed non-urgent and is allowing them to resume gradually.
Moore says dates for further lifting restrictions on businesses and social gatherings, set to happen in stages on Feb. 21 and March. 14, could be reviewed next week.
He says he’s reviewing the timelines for ending all public health measures including mask rules and proof-of-vaccination requirements and says he will make recommendations to government as early as next week.
His comments came a day after the Ontario’s health minister said the province wasn’t considering lifting mask rules or its vaccine passport system affecting businesses, as some other Canadian provinces have begun to do.
3:15 p.m. Health officials in New Brunswick are reporting another three deaths from COVID-19 in the province today, and this increases the toll to 278 since the start of the pandemic, reports The Canadian Press.
The latest deaths involve two people in the Saint John region, one in their 40s and the other over 90, and a person over 90 in the Fredericton area, according to CP.
There are 140 people hospitalized as a result of COVID-19, up one from Wednesday.
That includes one person in intensive care and eight people on ventilators.
There are 321 healthcare workers who are isolating after testing positive for COVID-19.
Provincial data shows 85.7 per cent of eligible New Brunswickers five and older have received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine and 47 per cent have had booster shots.
2:47 p.m. Health officials in Newfoundland and Labrador say there are now 25 people in hospital due to COVID-19, which matches the previous high in the province, reports The Canadian Press.
It’s the second time the province has seen this many pandemic-related hospitalizations; the first was less than two weeks ago on Feb. 1, according to CP.
A government news release today says eight of the hospitalized patients are in intensive care.
Officials are reporting 243 new cases of COVID-19, with 18 per cent of tests completed in the previous 24 hours yielding a positive result.
There are 1,588 active reported cases in the province, although the figure does not include those who may have contracted the disease, but did not qualify for a test to confirm their infection.
Federal data shows Newfoundland and Labrador continues to have the highest COVID-19 vaccination rate in the country, as 95 per cent of eligible residents have had at least one shot as of Jan. 30.
2:19 p.m. Health officials in Prince Edward Island are reporting seven people in hospital due to COVID-19. This is unchanged from Wednesday, reports The Canadian Press.
Chief public health officer, Dr. Heather Morrison, says that number includes one person in intensive care, according to CP.
She says there are five others in hospital who were admitted for non-COVID-19 reasons and have tested positive for the disease.
Morrison is reporting 210 new cases of COVID-19 today, along with 220 recoveries.
There are 1,982 active reported COVID-19 infections in the province.
Six long-term care facilities have outbreaks, and 21 early learning and child-care centres have reported cases or outbreaks.
1:54 p.m. Crowdfunding site GoFundMe will speak to members of Parliament about what measures it has in place to prevent the funding of extremism.
NDP MP Alistair MacGregor announced today representatives from the site have accepted a request to appear before the House of Commons standing committee on public safety and national security.
MacGregor brought forward the motion and says they will appear March 3.
It comes as a protest against vaccine mandates and COVID-19 health restrictions drags on well into its second week on Parliament Hill, clogging up surrounding streets.
Read the full story here on the Star.
1:20 p.m. A high school in southeast Manitoba is in “hold and secure” mode due to a protest against COVID-19 restrictions outside.
Steinbach Regional Secondary School says students will remain in classes with their teachers, while exterior doors are locked except for students and staff.
The local school division says RCMP are on scene at the school.
1:15 p.m. Ottawa’s public school board says it has reached out to local police about the potential for protesters to drive past schools today.
Protesters mused online about driving past schools after snarling traffic around the national capital’s airport earlier today.
The Ottawa-Carleton District School Board is calling the idea unacceptable, adding that the safety of students and staff shouldn’t be threatened.
So far, the board says there are no reports of concerning activity.
The board’s statement on Twitter says staff will make safety a top priority.
It adds that students and staff will shelter in place if there is reason for concern about school safety.
1:03 p.m. The Bank of Montreal is projecting that the Ambassador Bridge shutdown could start to cut into Canada’s first quarter GDP growth if the protests continue.
Each day they blockade the Ambassador Bridge, protesters are choking off a $400-million lifeline for the North American economy. They may already, experts say, have caused Canada “incalculable” long-term economic damage.
Everything from car parts and appliances to fruits and vegetables was sitting in long lines of tractor trailers on both sides of the Windsor-Detroit crossing Tuesday, snarled up behind protesters who say they’re against COVID-19 vaccine mandates.
Read here for more on the Ambassador Bridge blockade from the Star’s Jacob Lorinc.
12 p.m. RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust is “pruning” its tenant mix to ensure malls and other retail spaces it owns are filled with resilient businesses that are best positioned to weather any further COVID-19 upheaval.
Chief executive Jonathan Gitlin said Thursday that the Toronto-based commercial landlord’s close look at who is renting its spaces will result in the company shedding some assets in enclosed malls, “which are harder to evolve into today’s current demands from our tenants.”
“Within the properties that we are keeping, there is a tenant mix that in order to stay relevant and in order to stay on top of consumer trends, needs to continuously evolve and change,” he said on a call with analysts.
“We are switching over to more necessity-based purveyors and in some cases, it might not be tenants with amazing covenants, but they just have some great uses that will add to...the flavour of the shopping centre.”
11:45 a.m. Michigan’s governor is calling on Canadian authorities to end the protests at two busy border crossings
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer says the blockade at the Ambassador Bridge connecting Windsor and Detroit, and the Blue Water Bridge in Sarnia, Ont. is threatening her state’s economy.
She says local, provincial and federal governments in Canada must de-escalate what she calls an economic blockade.
Whitmer is calling on Canadian authorities to “take all necessary and appropriate steps” to immediately reopen all lanes of traffic.
11:37 a.m. After racking up debt through years of ultralow interest rates, Canadians are being urged to modify their spending as they face the prospect of rising borrowing costs coupled with soaring inflation.
“Recalibrate your spending completely, recalibrate how you’re living your life,” advises Laurie Campbell, director, client financial wellness at debt relief specialist Bromwich and Smith.
Like going on a diet, she says managing money while under stress requires lifestyle changes to avoid going back to old habits.
Campbell suggests people closely examine their whole financial situation and make a serious effort to reduce debt as much as possible even though the lifting of lockdowns will likely spur a desire to go out and spend.
11:25 a.m. Interim Conservative leader Candice Bergen is calling on protesters to take down the blockades of border crossings.
Speaking in the House of Commons, Bergen says the time has come for them to stop the disruptive action that is causing economic harm.
She says farmers, manufacturers, small businesses and families are suffering because of the border blockades.
Bergen adds that she doesn’t believe that is what the protesters want to do.
Bergen also says the protesters’ anti-vaccine-mandate message has been heard and is pledging her party’s support to that end.
Bergen made the comments today at the start of debate on a Conservative motion calling on the government for a plan for ending COVID-19 restrictions.
11 a.m. Manitoba RCMP say a protest has shut down the province’s main border crossing with the United States.
Mounties say a large number of vehicles and farm equipment is blocking the Emerson port of entry, located about 100 km south of Winnipeg.
They say no traffic is getting through in either direction and people should avoid the area.
A protest over COVID-19 public health measures also continues outside the Manitoba legislature in Winnipeg.
10:53 a.m . General Motors’ assembly plants in Ontario and Michigan have curbed production due to the Ambassador Bridge blockades. GM Oshawa cut workers’ hours yesterday, as did the Lansing Delta plant.
10:32 a.m. Ottawa police say nearly two dozen trucks have left the city. Police say a dozen trucks left a parking lot outside the city’s core after negotiations with protesters who have used the area as a staging and logistics ground.
Police say 10 more trucks have also left downtown, and another vehicle was towed for obstructing traffic.
They are also repeating their request that remaining protesters leave the city after almost two weeks of being encamped in the national capital.

10:16 a.m. Ontario reporting 1,897 people are hospitalized with COVID-19, 445 people are in ICU.
56 per cent were admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 and 44 per cent were admitted for other reasons but have tested positive for COVID-19; 76 per cent of patients admitted to the ICU were admitted for COVID-19 and 24 per cent were admitted for other reasons but have tested positive for COVID-19, according to Health Minister Christine Elliott.
In Ontario, 31,153,087 vaccine doses have been administered. 92.1 per cent of Ontarians 12+ have one dose and 89.6 per cent have two doses.
10:10 a.m. Ontario’s expert science advisers say rapid antigen tests don’t detect COVID-19 infections with the Omicron variant as reliably as they did with the Delta strain, but changing the way the tests are performed can boost their sensitivity.
The science advisory table says in a brief today that the rapid tests, which involve nasal swabs, are less sensitive for Omicron, especially in the first one or two days after infection.
But, they say the tests are better at detecting Omicron if people swab both cheeks, followed by the back of the tongue or throat, then both nostrils.
9:58 a.m. A new poll suggests almost 30 per cent of Canadians believe it’s time to lift pandemic restrictions and “learn to live” with the COVID-19 virus, while more than 40 per cent want measures to ease carefully.
Forty-three per cent of Canadians surveyed by Leger identified their feelings about the current state of the pandemic as “prudent” — the most popular answer of four options — saying they did not want to lift restrictions too quickly.
But 29 per cent said they were ready to move on, selecting the answer that said they were “adequately vaccinated” and viewed the Omicron variant as “less serious.”
9:45 a.m. Inflation soared over the past year at its highest rate in four decades, hammering America’s consumers, wiping out pay raises and reinforcing the Federal Reserve’s decision to begin raising borrowing rates across the economy.
The Labor Department said Thursday that consumer prices jumped 7.5 per cent last month compared with 12 months earlier, the steepest year-over-year increase since February 1982. The acceleration of prices ranged across the economy, from food and energy to apartment rents and electricity.
When measured from December to January, inflation was 0.6 per cent, the same as the previous month and more than economists had expected. Prices had risen 0.7 per cent from October to November and 0.9 per cent from September to October.
9:30 a.m. Spaniards removed their facemasks or stuffed them into their pockets for the first time in nearly two months after the country’s outdoor mask mandate was lifted Thursday. Italians face a similar treat Friday.
Both countries have high vaccination rates, declining infection numbers and lower hospitalization figures than during previous surges of the coronavirus. Sara de la Rubia, a 45-year-old nurse in Madrid, said dropping the masks will be a moment to test the effectiveness of vaccines.
“There has to be a moment in which we have to normalize things, start to (have) a normal life, to test how things work,” she said.
After peaking in January, Spain’s contagion rate has been dropping for two weeks, alleviating pressure on hospitals and encouraging authorities to relax some of the measures adopted in mid-December against the fast-spreading omicron variant of the coronavirus.
9:16 a.m. A protest against COVID-19 measures is preventing Canada-bound traffic from crossing the Ambassador Bridge for yet another day.
Police say those using the border bridge to cross into the U.S. can expect significant delays and are telling all motorists to avoid both access points to the span due to the ongoing demonstration.
The protest on the Canadian side of the bridge has prevented Canada-bound traffic from crossing since the demonstration began Monday.
8:57 a.m. Africa is moving to the “control phase” of the COVID-19 pandemic and increased vaccination rates will be crucial in helping the continent live with the disease, the World Health Organization’s Africa director Matshidiso Moeti said Thursday.
“Although COVID-19 will be with us for the long term, there is light at the end of the tunnel,” Moeti said. “This year we can end the disruption and destruction the virus has left in its path, and gain back control over our lives.”
Africa is heading toward “what might become a kind of endemic, living with the virus ... I believe that we are transitioning from the pandemic phase and we will now need to manage the presence of this virus,” she said, addressing reporters at a virtual media briefing.
8:33 a.m. French President Emmanuel Macron said last month he wanted to “p- off” the unvaccinated. He appears to have succeeded.
Protesters against the country’s vaccine mandates aim to use their vehicles to block roads in Paris beginning Friday to show their anger over the restrictions.
The Paris police issued an order banning the demonstration from Friday to Monday, citing the risk of “disturbing the public order.” The protesters, some of whom say they were inspired by the “freedom convoys” in Canada, plan to continue on to Brussels on Monday. Rudi Vervoort, head of the Brussels Capital regional government, said in a statement that the district was also banning the convoy.
8:15 a.m. Toyota’s three Ontario auto plants will stop production for the rest of the week due to the Ambassador Bridge blockade. That’s at least six auto plants shut down or reducing production over the protests.
8:05 a.m. As provinces begin lifting COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, psychology experts expect stress and anxiety to run high among those who remain wary of letting their guards down.
It will take time for many to adjust, they say, but the quick approach some provinces are taking could make the transition more jarring.
Alberta ended its vaccine certificate system on Wednesday, days before its mask requirements for students is set to drop, while Saskatchewan plans to do away with its vaccine mandate on Monday. Other provinces, including Ontario, have taken a more gradual approach to dismantling COVID-19 measures.
Steve Joordens, a psychology professor at the University of Toronto, said it’s natural for people to feel conflicted as restrictions ease.
Though many are tired of the mandates aimed at slowing the spread of the virus, there’s still some underlying fear.
“In the back of our mind there’s this niggling anxiety of: are we doing this too soon?” Joordens said. “Are we going to end up getting our butts kicked again (by a new variant)? And given all the division we’re seeing right now, could this make things worse?”
7:50 a.m. Britain’s Prince Charles has tested positive for COVID-19 and is self-isolating, his office said Thursday.
A message on the royal’s official Twitter page said Charles tested positive on Thursday morning and was “deeply disappointed” not to be able to attend a scheduled visit in Winchester, England.
No other details were immediately available.
Charles, 73, met dozens of people during a Wednesday evening reception at the British Museum.
7:30 a.m. Pope Francis’ first foreign trip of the year is to the Mediterranean island nation of Malta, the Vatican said Tuesday in announcing an April 2-3 trip that had originally been scheduled for 2020 but was postponed because of the pandemic.
Francis, 85, will visit the main island cities of Valletta, Rabat and Floriana as well as the island of Gozo. Further details were to be released later.
Migration is expected to be a theme of Francis’ visit, given Malta has been a flashpoint in Europe’s longstanding migration debate.
6:55 a.m. All extracurricular activities can return to Ontario schools starting immediately — meaning high-contact sports such as hockey and basketball that have been sidelined will be given the go-ahead, as will choirs and wind instruments for music, the Star has learned.
As Ontario continues to slowly ease COVID-19 restrictions while the Omicron surge slows, the province’s chief medical officer of health will announce the new measures for schools at his Thursday news conference.
The move will allow elementary and secondary school athletes to play without masks, but wear them when they are back at the bench, sources told the Star.

6:30 a.m. After two years of living with kids in periodic virtual learning and a partner who is an essential worker, Annette Power was “in desperate need of a vacation.”
She was ready to spend March break visiting her mother in Barbados with her two children, but the trip was cancelled.
The family came down with Omicron during the winter break, delaying the vaccination appointment dates for her kids.

6:14 a.m. The Toronto Zoo is reopening Thursday, 10 days after most restrictions eased in the province.
Zoo management said, in a statement posted on Facebook, the delay is “to work on some exciting new elements” being added to the facility.
Patrons will have to show their vaccine certificates with QR codes, along with a piece of ID, to enter the zoo, the statement added.

5:40 a.m . Coronavirus cases continue to rise rapidly in Tonga, and tests have confirmed that the particularly contagious omicron variant is behind the isolated Pacific island nation’s first community outbreak since the start of the pandemic, officials said Thursday.
Health Minister Saia Piukala told reporters that 31 more people had tested positive for the virus, nearly doubling Tonga’s active cases for the second day in a row to a total of 64, the online Matangi Tonga news portal and other media reported.
While the number may seem small, the nation of 105,000 had managed to escape thus far without any infections aside from a single case brought in from a missionary returning to Tonga from Africa last October, which was successfully isolated.
5:37 a.m. Casting the spreading “Freedom Convoy” protests as a grave threat to Canada, the federal government is settling into a back-seat role in the crisis, offering to send police reinforcements to the local officials leading the responses.
Federal ministers outlined the seriousness of the blockades that have now spread across the country, with blockades against COVID-19 health measures choking off key border crossings and threatening jobs, public safety and millions of dollars in trade.
At the same time, police in Ottawa sent their toughest warning yet to protesters occupying the streets of the capital: clear out or face the prospect of arrest.

5:36 a.m. As countries in Europe and other provinces in Canada begin lifting COVID restrictions, some Ontarians may be wondering why they still have to live with them.
Unlike in Alberta, Saskatchewan and some U.S. states and European countries, there are no immediate plans to do away with mask or vaccine mandates in Ontario, Health Minister Christine Elliott said at a press conference Wednesday.
This is despite Ontario’s COVID situation looking bright, according to Dr. Peter Jüni, scientific director of Ontario’s COVID-19 science table. Though it’s hard to gauge the true presence of COVID in the province, as the speed with which Omicron spread became too much for our testing infrastructure, techniques like wastewater surveillance seem to show Ontario is on the other side of Omicron’s peak.

5:27 a.m. A teachers’ strike has paralyzed learning at many Zimbabwean schools, which opened this week after a prolonged closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In Harare, some schools managed to open Thursday while at others a few teachers reported for work but did not teach, according to unions. The government denounced the strike as “unwarranted conduct” that is depriving children of their right to education.
Many teachers decided to stay at home to protest salaries of about $100 a month. They are demanding that their pay be increased to about $500 per month.
In 2018, teachers earned the equivalent of about $540 a month but that amount has been eroded by years of inflation, currently estimated at 60%, and the devaluation of Zimbabwe’s currency.
4 a.m. Dr. Kieran Moore’s weekly COVID-19 news conference comes a day after the province’s health minister said Ontario will keep its mask mandate and vaccine certificate system in place.
Christine Elliott said Ontario won’t follow the lead of other provinces that have already begun lifting proof-of-vaccination rules and intend to end masking rules soon. She didn’t say when those policies would end, but said the province expects mask rules will remain in place for “some time.”
Moore’s news conference also comes after the province began making rapid test kits available for free at grocery stores, pharmacies and other sites. Elliott said expanding access to the tests is part of Ontario’s plan to roll back COVID-19 restrictions in stages.
Thursday 4 a.m. The NDP is calling on the U.S. ambassador to testify before the House of Commons foreign affairs committee, saying American funding of the nearly two-week-long anti-vaccine mandate protest in Ottawa is an attack on Canada’s democracy.
A significant amount of the more than $10 million in donations to the demonstration came from U.S. donors.
The Commons committee meets today and would need unanimous consent of all parties to issue an invitation to Ambassador David Cohen.
Protesters have been warned by police that if they continue blocking streets they could be charged with mischief to property, have their vehicles and other property seized and possibly forfeited, and that charges or convictions may lead to them being barred from travelling to the United States.
The declaration from police comes after municipal officials in Ottawa spoke with the federal government to find solutions to end the protest that has sparked solidarity rallies, some of which have blocked traffic at border crossings in Coutts, Alta., and the busy Windsor-Detroit Ambassador Bridge crossing.
Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair says Ottawa residents have been subjected to “acts of thuggery and disrespect” by demonstrators, and the government is working to ensure Ottawa police have the “resources that they need to enforce the law to restore public order and to bring this unlawful protest to an end.’’

Coddling convoy was a big mistake

Full text: Here's what activists of all kinds can learn from the Ottawa occupation: in order to maximize media exposure and political impact at your future protests, be sure to arrive in trucks and be obnoxious.
Also: be right-wing.
It's hard to imagine what other lessons to draw from the farcically lenient treatment of the "freedom" convoy that has effectively taken Ottawa hostage for almost two weeks.
Residents of the nation's capital have been subjected to a rare and curious phenomenon that could be dubbed "police docility." It wasn't as if police were caught off-guard; convoy organizers had signalled their aggressive intentions.
Before the convoy left B.C., Patrick King, a longtime far-right activist (with no apparent trucking experience), told a Christian talk show that the convoy "plans to shut down Ottawa."
So Ottawa police had plenty of time to take basic police actions - like putting up concrete barriers - which would have prevented the men in large trucks from driving right up to the Parliament Buildings and the Prime Minister's Office and deciding that that was a nice place to park.
Having met no resistance as they secured the finest parking spots in Ottawa, the foreign-funded truckers behaved like they had just been handed the keys to the city, which in a way they had.
They settled in, built a command centre and a dining area with well-equipped kitchen, brought in barbecues, generators, bouncy castles, saunas and vast supplies of fuel. They then exercised their new-found freedom by ripping masks off local residents, who had the audacity to try to protect themselves from a virus that's killed 5.7 million people worldwide.
The occupation represents an abject failure by the Ottawa police - as well as by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Premier Doug Ford, both of whom have been fearful of triggering a confrontation that might antagonize right-wingers in Western Canada and rural Ontario.
By allowing the convoy to be coddled like this, Trudeau and Ford have given the freedom-bullies a sense of their own importance that is as oversized as their trucks.
In an online video he posted last August, King, the far-right activist, was angry and venomous, boasting he had a criminal record "the size of my f---ing arm. I am not a nice person."
King continued heatedly: "I've had just about enough. You have no idea what's coming ... Wait till the real bullets start flying."
But by last week, speaking from a "command centre" at an "undisclosed location" in occupied Ottawa, King's tone had turned from anger to jubilation: "Guys, I can't believe how friggin' amazing this is! The police last night - we've got videos of it - the police were carrying hot food to the truck drivers ... we moved in 80 trucks last night ... I'm having the time of my life ... I can't stop laughing because this is so awesome."
No wonder the far-right activist is giddy, pinching himself to make sure his dreams really have come true.
Only last September, the far-right and its anti-vax crusade was repudiated by Canadians in the federal election, when the People's Party failed to win a single seat.
Now, with a 12-day occupation of the nation's capital under their belts, the freedom-bullies have been catapulted to the centre of the national stage, looking like a force that'll have to be reckoned with in the future. Diane Deans, chair of the Ottawa Police Services Board, declared: "This is a nation-wide insurrection."
No, it isn't. It's just a small group of belligerent men with very big trucks.
I've been part of much larger demonstrations that got a fraction of the attention. If these guys hadn't been handed such an easy win in Ottawa, they - and their cause - would have likely gotten no more than a few minutes airtime on the national news.
Well done, Canadian authorities.

Doug Ford's billion-dollar election gimmick

Full text: For all the clamour and din, the ungodly honking and harassment, the bizarre ranting by the aggrieved that has seized public discourse of late, one complaint rarely heard was that Ontario’s licence plate renewal stickers were an intolerable affront.
Yet, as the Star’s Robert Benzie reported this week, we have the visionary government of Premier Doug Ford floating the prospect of scrapping them and saving drivers in the province up to $120 annually.
Now, no rational Ontarian would complain about saving money.
And the proposal is entirely on-brand for the buck-a-beer premier who has made great political hay from the large dividends he has cashed from modest gestures.
But the plan really makes sense on only one level. And that would be the Ford government’s re-election prospects in its scheduled consultation with voters this June.
It is, not to put too fine a point on it, bald-faced pandering.
While the amount is relatively small beer to individuals – and would cover a couple of tanks of gas or a few cases from The Beer Store – it adds up to more than $1 billion forgone by the provincial treasury.
And that amount comes at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has sent deficits of all governments soaring and when justified demands from key sectors for much-needed help is soaring.
As the Star reported, the idea was well-received by cabinet ministers when they were told of it this week. No kidding.
And it is expected to be introduced through legislation this spring and be in place before the election. What timing.
What it basically amounts to is siphoning a billion dollars out of public accounts to spend on the Ford government’s re-election bid.
That campaign – because of the premier’s uneven response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and his near-invisible response to the civil disobedience of anti-vaccine protesters – will be built on small-bore pocketbook issues of which this proposal is one.
It also plays to Ford’s favourite demographic – motorists.
While it would certainly be nice to save $120, that amount per year will change very few lives.
Forfeiting the treasury’s $1 billion, however, might result in fewer nurses, inadequate mental health services, more harm to those experiencing homelessness – or any number of benefits sacrificed so the premier can play his preferred role as this season’s political Easter bunny, bringing goodies to anything on four wheels.
Under the reported plan, which would affect 8.5 million vehicles in Ontario, annual fees ranging from $12 for mopeds to $120 for passenger vehicles would be scrapped. Drivers would still pay a one-time fee of about $20 for a new licence plate.
The obligation of a provincial leader is too look at the big picture and take the long view – not the shovelling of a few spadefuls of snow, or the doling out of what amounts to nickels and dimes.
New Democrat Jennifer French told Benzie the bottom line for Ontarians is that the cost of living in Ontario has ballooned on everything from gas to groceries under Ford’s watch.
The premier should be focused, she said, on addressing big-ticket issues such as housing, hydro and child-care costs.
To be sure, it’s an odd state of affairs when the twin obsessions of a premier seem to be licence plates and beer prices.
Then again, few would claim the current era has produced what future history books will regard as the golden age of political leadership.

Full text: OTTAWA—Pressure is mounting on police and political leaders to take action to end the trucker protests jamming the nation’s capital and border traffic at three Canada-U.S. entry points.
But Ottawa’s top cop said breaking up the protests is no simple task, describing the so-called Freedom Convoy as a “sophisticated” operation able to run provincial- and national-level campaigns.
“This is an unprecedented demonstration. It has significant levels of fundraising, co-ordination and communication. They have command centres established here and across the country and beyond this country,” Ottawa police Chief Peter Sloly told reporters Thursday, adding that Canada’s national security agencies have backed that assessment.
The Ottawa police increased their presence on the main roadway in front of Parliament Hill late Thursday, as the Ontario government moved to freeze the flow of funds from one of the convoy’s primary fundraising channels — the U.S.-based Christian crowdfunding platform GiveSendGo.
Ontario’s attorney general brought an application to the Superior Court of Justice seeking an order that would block anyone from “disposing of, or otherwise dealing with … any and all monetary donations made through the Freedom Convoy 2022 and Adopt-a-Trucker campaign pages” on the GiveSendGo platform.
“This afternoon, the order was issued. It binds any and all parties with possession or control over these donations,” said Ivana Yelich, a spokesperson for Premier Doug Ford. Effectively, it freezes the spending of the funds raised.
The campaigns have together amassed more than $9 million (U.S.) to fuel, feed and house demonstrators who have gridlocked downtown Ottawa for two weeks to protest COVID-19 mandates and restrictions. Convoy organizers turned to GiveSendGo, the new platform, after crowdfunding site GoFundMe last week yanked the protest’s original fundraiser from its website.
Late Thursday, GiveSendGo tweeted a statement in response to the Ontario court order, defying the Canadian court’s ability to touch its funds or their intended destination.
“Canada has absolutely ZERO jurisdiction over how we manage our funds here at GiveSendGo. All funds for EVERY campaign on GiveSendGo flow directly to the recipients of those campaigns, not least of which is The Freedom Convoy campaign,” the organization said on Twitter.
Police cleared more than a dozen trucks but hundreds still clogged downtown Ottawa streets Thursday as Michigan’s governor called on Canada to end the protest now jamming critical cross-border traffic between Windsor and Detroit.
In a statement posted on Twitter, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called for a quick resolution to the ongoing closure of the Ambassador Bridge.
“It is imperative that Canadian local, provincial and national governments de-escalate this economic blockade,” Whitmer said. “They must take all necessary and appropriate steps to immediately and safely reopen traffic so we can continue growing our economy.”
But Canadian governments argue their hands are tied because a basic tenet of democracy is that politicians cannot direct police operations. That leaves lawmakers on this side of the border urging protesters to leave and chiding political opponents.
As the crisis built Tuesday night, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to Premier Doug Ford by phone. Ford spoke to other federal ministers late Wednesday as the stoppage at Windsor-Detroit choked key supply chains, leading to shift cancellations by at least three major car manufacturers in Ontario.
However, the Ontario government has declined to participate in the federal government’s proposed trilateral discussion table on the convoy response.
The provincial government sees no use “in another meeting where a table of politicians are sitting around really not able to accomplish anything, because this is … a policing matter,” said Yelich, the Ford spokesperson.
“There’s nothing Justin Trudeau can do, really, at this time, and there’s nothing that Doug Ford can do,” said Yelich.
“We need the police to enforce the law.”
The Windsor-Detroit border blockade is clearly “illegal,” said Yelich, and “the police are the ones that will have to enforce the laws that are being broken there.”
Sloly on Thursday warned other demonstrators against coming to Ottawa this weekend.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Ontario Provincial Police are sending help on top of the 250 Mounties already deployed, although Sloly could not say how many more. He said several forces from the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area are dispatching additional “public order units” — or riot squads — to bolster Ottawa’s force.
“With more resources, we’ll get more results and a safer end to this unlawful demonstration,” he said. “It’s been incredibly difficult,”
Sloly said some towing companies have refused to help police operations, and some tow-truck operators have reported being threatened.
Ottawa police will continue to “harden” their response in the downtown core, Sloly said, after they “negotiated” the departure of 12 trucks from a staging area near an Ottawa baseball stadium and 10 others from downtown. He said his officers have issued 1,700 tickets, made 25 arrests and laid criminal charges, and that another 126 “active investigations” were underway.
Sloly said the policing operation has cost up to $800,000 a day, and that expense will increase as more officers arrive.
Trudeau and his top ministers have repeatedly said that politicians’ options are limited, and that the federal government will not direct any police operations, but would ensure Ottawa and Windsor have all the resources they need.
A senior federal government source, speaking on condition they not be identified, said federal and provincial ministers have been communicating with their counterparts and municipal leaders, but that more co-ordination is needed between the three levels of government.
The official expressed cautious optimism that Ontario will soon provide more OPP officers in Windsor.
In the House of Commons on Thursday, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh demanded the prime minister “stop hiding behind jurisdiction and fix this mess.”
The truckers’ protests have also spread to major cities including Quebec City, Winnipeg and Toronto, and border crossings in Alberta and Manitoba.
The Ambassador Bridge is a key route in the cross-border transportation of auto parts, medical supplies, manufactured goods and fresh produce. Thousands of trucks have been diverted to another border crossing in Sarnia, which is struggling to cope with the increased traffic.
The federal government continues to insist that it won’t give into demands that it immediately drop COVID-19 vaccination mandates for international truckers. It has noted many pandemic restrictions, such as masking and business capacity limits, fall under provincial jurisdiction, and maintain that controlling the protests is a local policing matter.
The RCMP has jurisdiction to handle the Alberta and Manitoba border protests, but only because it operates in those provinces under contract to the provincial government.
The federal Conservatives, whose interim leader and prominent MPs have supported the convoy protesters and argued Trudeau should grant their demands to drop mandates, reversed course on Thursday, saying it’s time for the protesters to go home because of the economic damage they have caused.
On Parliament Hill, the trucks, SUVs and pickups jamming major downtown routes remained, sprawled across several city blocks.
Police reiterated a warning issued Wednesday that under the offence known as “mischief to property,” protesters could be arrested without warrant, see their vehicles seized and possibly forfeited, and be barred from crossing into the U.S. if charged or convicted.
Police also warned of a “concerted effort” to inundate its 911 and non-emergency policing reporting line with illegitimate calls.
“This endangers lives and is completely unacceptable,” the police service posted on Twitter. “We track calls and will charge anyone deliberately interfering with emergencies.”
Early Thursday morning, around “60 to 70 light trucks” slowly circled the Ottawa International Airport, according to a statement from the airport. A spokesperson said the protesters left about two hours later.

Full text: For Ontario NDP Leader Andrea Horwath, it doesn't get any better.
At a mandatory leadership review Sunday, fellow New Democrats gave her a ringing 85 per cent endorsement - her best ever. The party is in the best shape since she became leader 13 years ago, boasting 40 seats and brimming with money, she reassured delegates.
But it better get better by June 2. That's when all Ontario voters render their verdict in the coming election.
Now Canada's longest-serving party leader, Horwath predicted she'll finally be sitting in the premier's office post-election. In her weekend pitch for support, Horwath rattled off the sins of Doug Ford's Progressive Conservative government and lambasted the legacy of the last Liberal dynasty.
"My friends, let me say it loud and clear: On June 2, I'm confident we will get it done!" Horwath told party delegates listening in via Zoom.
What she didn't explain is why, if Ford is so hapless a premier, and the Liberals so lamentable, so many people still prefer them to the NDP? Despite Horwath's bravado about the 2018 seat count, the reality is that the party is not where it needs to be on the eve of the 2022 election.
After four years in power, and two years of pandemic, Ford is in first place in most public opinion polls. The Liberals and New Democrats keep fighting for second, trading places monthly.
Put another way, the odds of Ford winning the most seats are 92 per cent, according to a Feb. 2 analysis by 338canada.com, the respected online survey of surveys. The Liberals have only a seven per cent chance of coming out on top.
The NDP's prospects? Its chances of beating out the Tories for first place show up as zero per cent, according to the analysis.
What's holding Horwath back? It is conventional wisdom, at NDP conventions, that their leader is the most popular politician in Ontario.
In fact, last month's Léger poll puts her popularity at roughly the same as Ford's: The premier's "favourable" rating is 38 per cent, versus 40 for Horwath - a statistical tie.
Unsurprisingly, Ford's unfavourable number is higher at 56 per cent. And yet fully 42 per cent of voters gave Horwath an unfavourable rating - leaving her, too, in negative territory in the popularity sweepstakes.
(Leger pegs the party standings at about the same as most other polls over the past year - Tories leading at 37 per cent, with the Liberals and NDP at 27 and 26 per cent, respectively.)
Why has Horwath-mania not come to Ontario? After all, NDP delegates keep voting for her to stay on - Sunday's 85 per cent is an improvement over the 76 per cent she got from party stalwarts a decade ago.
Her Liberal rival, Steven Del Duca has lower popularity ratings and name recognition, and has yet to put forward any major policy planks.
Yet after only two years as leader, he is on track to win more seats, according to the projections.
Part of it is presumably the brand. While Horwath was preaching to the NDP converted on the weekend, Del Duca was cheerfully pitching to a meeting of the federal Liberals' Ontario wing, hoping to profit from the national party's continuing grip on the province.
The different strategies are instructive. Del Duca focused on Ford's bungling with a promise to replace it with "competent" leadership - all the while ignoring the NDP.
Horwath, by contrast, devoted almost as much time to attacking the Liberals as she did the Tories - making the case that Ford was not entirely at fault because he inherited a mess from Del Duca's Liberals.
"It would be easy ... to lay the blame just at Doug Ford's feet," she mused, preparing to pivot. "Which brings me to Steven Del Duca and his Liberals."
Mocking his claim that Ontario needs a "competent" premier, Horwath countered: "Between 2003 and 2018 ... you were sitting at the Liberal government's cabinet table" (Del Duca was a minister from 2014-18).
With the "social democratic solutions only New Democrats offer," she exhorted, "we must win the election."
Horwath's targeting of Del Duca is a recurring crutch. In attack ads last year, the NDP showed an unflattering clip of the Liberal leader blinking into the camera while tying him to former premier Kathleen Wynne.
The strategy is to assign blame equally between Tories and Liberals, with the NDP blameless and virtuous. More to the point, it casts the current premier and his predecessor (Ford and Wynne - and by extension Del Duca) as two sides of the same coin - Tweedledee and Tweedledum.
That's the phrase the NDP relied on in previous campaigns against its old rivals. Sometimes it works, most times it doesn't.
So far it hasn't got Horwath where she needs to get by June 2. For better or for worse.
In a column last month I mentioned that the latest NDP attack ad shows Del Duca blinking in slow motion. The NDP assures me it did not tinker with Del Duca's blink rate. The Liberals say the clip is pulled from the start of a Zoom event while their leader was waiting for his cue to talk, but the NDP counters that all's fair in the public domain.
Mea culpa, but I still think the NDP is culpable in its own way. The clip is undistorted, but it's undignified. It's not manipulated, but it's manipulative. If I was thrown off by the ad's conspicuous flicker and misstated the frame rate, it's because I'm always suspicious of dubious attack ads that "frame" political rivals.

Rivals slam Doug Ford's plan to scrap licence plate renewal fees

Full text: It’s a $1 billion sticker shock.
Premier Doug Ford’s proposal to eliminate licence plate renewal stickers — which would save motorists up to $120 annually — is being panned by his political opponents.
As disclosed by the Star on Monday, the Progressive Conservatives are preparing a plan to scrap the yearly tags for 8.5 million vehicles in Ontario, which would cost the treasury more than $1 billion.
With legislation expected this spring so the fees would be lifted before the June 2 election, Transportation Minister Caroline Mulroney’s office did not deny it was coming.
“Our government is considering a number of options to cut costs for Ontarians,” Mulroney’s office told the Star on Monday.
But NDP MPP Jennifer French (Oshawa) reminded the Tories what happened last time they tackled licence plates.
“Doug Ford already failed spectacularly at one licence plate project,” said French, referring to the government’s bungled 2019 bid to switch the traditionally white plates to Tory blue.
That scheme was abandoned in 2020 after it emerged the new plates were illegible to police and other motorists in some light conditions.
“Who knows if Ford will follow through or if this is just a shameless pre-election trial balloon,” added the New Democrat.
“The bottom line for everyday people is that under Doug Ford, the cost of living in Ontario has ballooned on everything from the price of gas to food,” said French.
“It’s long past due that Doug Ford do something about major costs like housing, child care and hydro bills.”
Green Leader Mike Schreiner said there are more effective — and environmentally sensitive — ways to help Ontarians’ pocketbooks.
“The premier should bring back the electric vehicle rebates he cancelled (in 2018) if wants to make life more affordable,” said Schreiner.
“If he wants to make driving cheaper for people, going electric is the way to go,” he said, noting it costs him $10 in electricity to charge his Chevrolet Bolt, compared to $100 to fill up many vehicles with gasoline.
Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca’s office declined to comment, saying it would “weigh in when and if it is real.”
The rising cost of fuel is one reason why the Tories are pushing the elimination of annual licence tags.
But scrapping the fees, ranging from $12 for mopeds to $120 for passenger vehicles, will be complicated because the government is still working out how to refund hundreds of millions of dollars to motorists who renewed their stickers last year for 2023.
Drivers would still pay a one-time fee of around $20 for a new licence plate.
The government is in discussions with police and municipalities to determine the impact of getting rid of the stickers.

Conservatives shelve support for carbon levy: Interim leader tells MPs issue must be debated during upcoming leadership race

Full text: Interim Conservative Leader Candice Bergen shelved her party's election pledge to put a consumer price on carbon Wednesday, saying the issue needs to be debated during the upcoming leadership race.
For now, the party will stick to its official position against federal carbon levies, Bergen told MPs during their weekly caucus meeting, multiple MPs told the Star.
That decision came as Bergen seeks to reunite a team rent asunder under the leadership of Erin O'Toole, who those same MPs ousted last week.
And a rejection of O'Toole's environmental plan wasn't the only step in that regard.
Bergen also welcomed Sen. Denise Batters back into the caucus, after O'Toole had kicked her out for launching a petition that called for an early review of his leadership.
O'Toole's carbon pricing plan had been one of the reasons Batters cited for the need to have a new leader. On Wednesday, she was all smiles as she strode out of the meeting.
Bergen has not held a news conference since her fellow Conservative MPs chose her as their interim leader last week.
"My goal as interim leader is to strengthen our movement and leave the next leader with a party that's ready to win," she said in a statement at the time.
Her office did not immediately return a request for comment Wednesday.
O'Toole's embrace of carbon pricing had marked a major shift in party policy - the Conservatives have long opposed carbon levies and O'Toole had run for the party's leadership promising to scrap what Tories referred to as the federal "carbon tax."
But in a bid to put forward a climate change plan that would be seen as credible, he pivoted after he won and promised that an elected Conservative government would introduce a consumer price on carbon.
Unlike the Liberals' existing plan, which charges a levy and sends rebates to consumers, O'Toole's proposal would have used money raised by the levy to fund savings accounts that Canadians could use to make environmentally friendly purchases.
The approach was applauded by many Conservatives, who felt the lack of a climate change plan had severely hurt them during the 2019 election.
But many others remain resolutely opposed to the idea, and O'Toole unveiled his proposal just a month after the party's grassroots had rejected inserting an acknowledgment that "climate change is real" in their official policy book.
"We believe that there should be no federally imposed carbon taxes or cap and trade systems on either the provinces or on the citizens of Canada," the policy book states. "The provinces and territories should be free to develop their own climate change policies, without federal interference or federal penalties or incentives."
O'Toole later dismissed that vote as a meaningless distraction, but when he released his own plan, many of his own MPs felt slighted when they heard about it for first time in media reports.
Three MPs told the Star that Bergen's shelving of the O'Toole carbon plan came without warning as well.
Meanwhile, Ottawa-area MP Pierre Poilievre remains the only person who has so far said that he would seek the party leadership.
Last December, he called for the federal government to freeze planned increases to carbon pricing, and he has long railed against "carbon taxes" in general.
One of his potential competitors in the race, Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown, supported putting a price on carbon when he was leader of Ontario's Progressive Conservatives.
On Wednesday, Brown weighed in on another issue currently dividing the federal Conservatives: the protests against COVID-19 restrictions and vaccination mandates.
Brown echoed Tory MP Michael Chong, who said earlier this week that while people have a right to freedom of expression and to protest, they don't have a right to blockade.
The protest organizers are calling for an end to COVID-19 restrictions, including vaccination mandates, and demanding the federal government take action, despite the fact that most restrictions have been enacted by provincial governments.
Former Conservative party leader Andrew Scheer was spotted Wednesday chatting with demonstrators in front of Parliament Hill. But Calgary MP Ron Liepert said his "law and order" party shouldn't be supporting protests that are unlawful, and it is time for the demonstrators to go home because their point has been made.
"I think you're going to see in the next day or so some initiatives from the Conservatives that are going to hopefully convince these folks that their point has been made," Liepert told reporters Wednesday.

But among its 55 recommendations released Tuesday, critics and politicians agreed the proposal to end exclusionary zoning — the restriction that shuts off 70 per cent of Toronto’s residential land to anything but single-family homes — will be key to solving the housing crisis.
The proposal will almost certainly be controversial with homeowners. But the transition has already begun, with the introduction of policies permitting laneway, garden-suite and multiplex housing in those neighbourhoods, said Mayor John Tory.
Without introducing that gentle densification, he said, “We simply will not be able to sustain the growth in an equitable and fair manner and make sure everybody can find the city to be a home for them.”
Tory said the city will be able to persuade residents the proposal is in the best interest of maintaining stable neighbourhoods and their children’s housing futures.
“Stable neighbourhoods don’t necessarily have to mean static neighbourhoods,” he said. It is ironic, added the mayor, that large houses now owned by one family used to be houses in which there were two or three flats.
Removing single-family zoning is just part of a vast public planning makeover proposed in the report of the Ontario Housing Affordability Task Force released Tuesday. It says Ontario needs to build 1.5 million houses in 10 years. That’s almost twice as many as it built in the last decade, although last year, there were 100,000 housing starts, according to the province.
The task force says municipalities will have to open established neighbourhoods to more affordable units, take the politics out of development approvals and encourage more rentals and modern construction techniques and materials.
It’s not clear whether the province will adopt any or all of the recommendations. Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Steve Clark said on Monday that he has time to act on the findings before the June 2nd election.
Toronto City Councillor Mike Colle, who was behind a motion at city council last month to ask the province to implement anti-flipping and speculation measures, said his reading of the report was “a humungous buffet for developers,” with “no requirements for affordability whatsoever.”
“Unless you put in some kind of restrictions, (speculators) will just see another opportunity to make windfall profits for years to come,” said the former Liberal MPP. Meantime, he said, residents will be taking out huge mortgages they can ill afford.
NDP housing critic Jessica Bell said zoning reform is “a smart and sustainable approach that will allow for the construction of more affordable townhomes, duplexes and triplexes.” Those are typically $500,000 cheaper than a semi-detached house and more in line with what a family can afford, she said.
But, she said, there are red flags among the recommendations, notably the proposal to expand municipal boundaries into nonenvironmentally protected areas, putting urban sprawl on farmland.
“It is not sustainable,” she said. “It locks people into epic, soul-destroying two-hour commutes. And it is expensive for municipalities to provide the infrastructure and the services to new subdivisions.”
Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner called it a “significant contradiction” that the report talks about protecting farmland and the environmentally sensitive Greenbelt, while also suggesting housing be aligned with Highway 413, which, “is going to supercharge sprawl and supercharge climate pollution.”
Schreiner said the task force was focused entirely on the private sector’s role in bolstering housing supply rather than assigning a role to the provincial and federal governments.
“Part of why you’re seeing a housing affordability crisis is that both the provincial and federal levels of government got out of housing in the mid-1990s. The housing affordability crisis has been getting worse every year since then, and it’s reached a breaking point,” he said.
Real estate expert John Pasalis says there are some good things in the report, including a limit on public consultations that are used to stonewall housing development. But he’s not convinced the task force’s proposals will lead to increased affordability. Nor is it entirely realistic.
“We’re building 65,000 homes (a year) on average in Ontario. How do you get to 150,000,” he said. “We’re not going to more than double our housing completions in 10 years. You can’t solve that problem with a two-month task force.”
He also doesn’t believe the private sector will provide more affordable rental housing. “Builders are building what’s most lucrative and it’s higher-end rentals and not because they’re evil people but because they’re businesses and they want to make a profit,” he said.
The composition of the task force and its homebuilding agenda completely missed any discussion of the other ingredients it takes to build a community, said Cathie Macdonald, co-chair of the Federation of North Toronto Residents’ Associations (FONTRA).
“It’s complicated. It’s not just churning out development applications,” she said.
Macdonald said FONTRA also takes exception to the report’s proposal to limit public and stakeholder consultations, saying they build better developments and communities.
“Consultation is important in bringing perspective and knowledge about the neighbourhood — what works and what doesn’t work,” she said. “The province has certainly been cutting as many opportunities as possible to do this.”

Emma Teitel: As Toronto's homeless freeze, modular housing for them sits empty in a city parking lot. Blame Doug Ford's government

Full text: In late January, amid frigid temperatures and several COVID-19 outbreaks at city shelters, St. Michael’s Hospital reported a rise in homeless Torontonians arriving at the emergency room with frostbite and hypothermia.
According to city councillor John Filion (Ward 18-Willowdale), on the eve of Toronto’s colossal mid-January snowstorm, someone set fire to the tent of a Willowdale man who was living in a local parkette. Luckily he was not inside the tent at the time.
Meanwhile, only a couple kilometres away from the scene of the alleged crime, on a sprawling TTC parking lot, the prefabricated units of a brand new modular housing project sat empty in the snow.
In fact, they still sit there today and they have sat there untouched since November, throughout Toronto’s dangerous cold snap, throughout homeless Torontonians’ many visits to the ER, throughout their deaths.
The modular housing units sit empty near Finch Station, a five-minute drive from their intended destination. That destination — 175 Cummer Ave. — should be the site of a housing solution in a bitterly cold city facing a housing crisis. Instead it represents a crisis of confidence in the provincial government to deliver on the promise of housing for all.
If you want to see a politician talk out of both sides of his mouth, behold: in the same week Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Steve Clark unveiled a bold plan to challenge urban NIMBYism and enable the construction of 1.5 million homes in the next decade, he maintained his refusal to approve the construction of supportive housing that could have been built months ago.
Last spring the city asked the minister to sign off on the MZO — Minister’s Zoning Order — necessary to build modular supportive housing at 175 Cummer Ave., a three-storey building that would boast approximately 59 studio apartments. But the minister has refused to sign the MZO because in a statement made to the Star, he is unsatisfied with the “consultation” conducted around the project.
“I’ve said many times, not just with this project, but with many, many other projects, municipalities have to do their due diligence,” Clark told the Star. “They have to have proper consultation before they even request the MZO. So, you know, I’ve spoken with the local MPP and it’s encouraging that he and the mayor are working together to look at alternate sites to ensure the process works.”
According to the minister’s spokesperson, Clark “will speak with mayor (John) Tory and MPP (Stan) Cho to ensure” the project is “moving expediently.”
But the minister’s enthusiasm for further consultation is rich because his government’s new report on housing affordability recommends limiting exactly that: the seemingly endless community consultations that stall new housing in cities.
From the report itself: “NIMBYism (not in my backyard) is a major obstacle to building housing. It drags out the approval process, pushes up costs, and keeps out new residents. Because local councillors depend on the votes of residents who want to keep the status quo, the planning process has become politicized.”
And yet, ironically, in the Willowdale case it is the local MPP, not the local councillor who appears to have politicized the process. Local councillor John Filion is on board with the project despite strong opposition from a vocal group of residents. So is deputy mayor Ana Bailão who is frustrated it hasn’t moved forward.
The person who remains stubbornly opposed to the project at 175 Cummer Ave. is Stan Cho, the novice MPP from Willowdale who is staring down an election season and trying desperately to appease a group of constituents who don’t want the project to move forward.
Specifically, they don’t want it to move forward at 175 Cummer Ave. where it would exist next to a seniors residence — a situation some on a local Facebook page opposed to the project appear to believe will increase crime in the area.
But residents’ prevailing concern, according to Cho himself, is that the leafy Willowdale neighbourhood is unsuitable for people exiting homelessness. “When we’re talking about suitability, we have to think about the needs of the people,” the MPP told me on the phone Tuesday morning.
“I look forward to the day I can walk with the mayor and cut the ribbon on modular housing in Willowdale,” he said. But today is not that day because in his view and in the view of some of his constituents, the proposed location for the modular housing is too far away from grocery stores and amenities to be suitable for previously homeless residents. Despite a quick Google search revealing that the site is only a 10-minute bus ride and 15-minute walk to the nearest grocery store, Cho has previously referred to the neighbourhood as a “food desert.”
“When we’re talking about the most vulnerable in our communities we want to set them up for success,” he told me.
It’s not every day you hear someone reference a deep concern for homeless people to justify denying them a home. But it’s not surprising either.
When residents and leaders of any political stripe say they believe homeless people should live closer to amenities what they really mean is that they should live away from other people. Neighbourhoods are for us. Main drags are for them. Housing is a human right anywhere but here.

As several Tories weigh leadership run, Candice Bergen gathers MPs to chart a path forward

Full text: OTTAWA — A topsy-turvy time for federal Conservatives enters a new phase Wednesday with interim leader Candice Bergen set to preside over the first formal gathering of MPs since they dumped Erin O’Toole last week.
But while Conservatives put forward a united call Tuesday for the end of COVID-19 vaccination mandates — buoyed by a Liberal MP breaking ranks with the government over the issue — fundamental challenges remain behind the scenes.
One will be visible Wednesday just through the windows of the room where the Tory caucus usually meets: truckers who have been blocking major streets around Parliament Hill for 12 days and show no signs of going home.
Ahead of the protesters’ arrival in Ottawa, Conservative caucus members were publicly united in their support for the truckers’ cause — that vaccination mandates for cross-border drivers were unfair and would cripple their industry.
Even as the trucks rolled in — and racist, destructive and harassing behaviour popped up during the early days — many remained aligned with them; two days before O’Toole got the boot and she took over, Bergen sat down for dinner with two of those camping out in downtown Ottawa.
But as the demonstrators have dug in, and as their impact on the day-to-day movement of Ottawa residents has taken its toll, the tone of the response from some Tories is shifting.
What’s happening is no longer a protest but a blockade, and that’s beyond the scope of people’s fundamental right to have their voices heard, said longtime Tory MP Michael Chong.
The protesters need to go home, Chong said, but the politicians need to think deeply about the frustration that brought the “Freedom Convoy” to Parliament Hill.
“We have gotten to this place because we have not been serious. We have not been serious about the rule of law,” he said during an emergency debate on the issue in the House of Commons.
“We have not been serious about ensuring our democratic institutions reflect the diversity of views in this country. We have not been serious about domestic policy. We have not been serious about foreign policy. It is time we got serious.”
The speech immediately set Tory tongues wagging about whether Chong would to take another run at the party leadership, as he did in 2017. Asked Tuesday, the member for Wellington—Halton Hills would only tell the Star that he is thinking about how he can best serve his country.
Others doing some thinking include Chong’s caucus colleague Leslyn Lewis, who placed third in the 2020 leadership race; Tasha Kheiriddin, a prominent Conservative thinker and strategist; Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown; and former leadership contender and Progressive Conservative party leader Peter MacKay.
Meanwhile, Pierre Poilievre, the party’s finance critic, is expected to be shuffled out of that job after launching his campaign to lead the party.
Leadership contenders generally don’t get to hold critic positions that would give them a higher profile during the race, although no one within the party thinks Poilievre needs that to galvanize his supporters.
His launch video posted late Saturday night has attracted 3.9 million views on Twitter alone, and he already has numerous endorsements from fellow MPs.
Poilievre’s organization is also already collecting signatures in support of his nomination, despite the fact no formal rules of the race have been set, and likely won’t be for at least a few weeks.
The rules will also include a cut-off for membership sales to would-be voters. Efforts to boost the ranks of card-carrying Tories have already begun.
In a post-election review conducted for the party, one recommendation was to make memberships free to expand the party’s base, but it’s unlikely that recommendation — or any other from the review — will be implemented on Bergen’s watch.
“An interim leader is limited in what they can do to change the party or the mechanics — that’s not the job they were elected to do,” said Garry Keller, who served as chief of staff to Rona Ambrose when she was interim leader.
“The job is to provide a steady hand on the wheel and turn the party over in better shape than when they came into the position.”
Bergen has already moved swiftly to put her stamp on the front benches of the party, pushing aside long-time O’Toole loyalists in favour of a fresh team. A larger shuffle of critics prompted by Poilievre’s move is likely as well.
Another issue potentially on the table for Wednesday’s meeting is whether Bergen will bring Sen. Denise Batters back into the fold. Batters was kicked out of caucus by O’Toole for demanding a leadership review, and her dismissal exacerbated tensions within the party’s ranks.
When it comes to charting a policy path forward for the party, Bergen will also be navigating a tricky course, said Keller.
“She has a delicate balancing act: reflect where the caucus and party is at as in policy pronouncements and in communications, but not to make radical policy decisions that have major impacts on platform and policy in the future that could bind the hands of a future leader.”

Conservatives drop support for carbon pricing, bring an O'Toole foe back from exile

Full text: OTTAWA — Interim Conservative Leader Candice Bergen shelved her party’s election pledge to put a consumer price on carbon Wednesday, saying the issue needs to be debated during the upcoming leadership race.
For now, the party will stick to its official position against federal carbon levies, Bergen told MPs during their weekly caucus meeting, multiple MPs told the Star.
That decision came as Bergen seeks to reunite a team rent asunder under the leadership of Erin O’Toole, who those same MPs ousted last week.
And a rejection of O’Toole’s environmental plan wasn’t the only step in that regard.
Bergen also welcomed Sen. Denise Batters back into the caucus, after O’Toole had kicked her out for launching a petition that called for an early review of his leadership.
O’Toole’s carbon pricing plan had been one of the reasons Batters cited for the need to have a new leader. On Wednesday, she was all smiles as she strode out of the meeting.
”I’m just thrilled (to be) back into my Conservative family,” she said.
Bergen has not held a news conference since her fellow Conservative MPs chose her as their interim leader last week.
”My goal as interim leader is to strengthen our movement and leave the next leader with a party that’s ready to win,” she said in a statement at the time.
Her office did not immediately return a request for comment Wednesday.
O’Toole’s embrace of carbon pricing had marked a major shift in party policy — the Conservatives have long opposed carbon levies and O’Toole had run for the party’s leadership promising to scrap what Tories referred to as the federal “carbon tax.”
But in a bid to put forward a climate change plan that would be seen as credible, he pivoted after he won and promised that an elected Conservative government would introduce a consumer price on carbon.
Unlike the Liberals’ existing plan, which charges a levy and sends rebates to consumers, O’Toole’s proposal would have used money raised by the levy to fund savings accounts that Canadians could use to make environmentally friendly purchases.
The approach was applauded by many Conservatives, who felt the lack of a climate change plan had severely hurt them during the 2019 election, especially in the vote-rich areas around Toronto and B.C.’s Lower Mainland.
But many others remain resolutely opposed to the idea, and O’Toole unveiled his proposal just a month after the party’s grassroots had rejected inserting an acknowledgment that “ climate change is real ” in their official policy book.
“We believe that there should be no federally imposed carbon taxes or cap and trade systems on either the provinces or on the citizens of Canada,” the policy book states. “The provinces and territories should be free to develop their own climate change policies, without federal interference or federal penalties or incentives.”
O’Toole later dismissed that vote as a meaningless distraction, but when he released his own plan, many of his own MPs felt slighted when they heard about it for first time in media reports.
Three MPs told the Star that Bergen’s shelving of the O’Toole carbon plan came without warning as well.
Meanwhile, Ottawa-area MP Pierre Poilievre remains the only person who has so far said that he would seek the party leadership.
Last December, he called for the federal government to freeze planned increases to carbon pricing, and he has long railed against “carbon taxes” in general.
One of his potential competitors in the race, Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown, supported putting a price on carbon when he was leader of Ontario’s Progressive Conservatives.
On Wednesday, Brown weighed in on another issue currently dividing the federal Conservatives: the protests against COVID-19 restrictions and vaccination mandates, which began in downtown Ottawa and how now spread to the Canada-U.S. border .
Brown echoed Tory MP Michael Chong, who said earlier this week that while people have a right to freedom of expression and to protest, they don’t have a right to blockade.
The protest organizers are calling for an end to COVID-19 restrictions, including vaccination mandates, and demanding the federal government take action, despite the fact that most restrictions have been enacted by provincial governments.
Former Conservative party leader Andrew Scheer was spotted Wednesday chatting with demonstrators in front of Parliament Hill. But Calgary MP Ron Liepert said his “law and order” party shouldn’t be supporting protests that are unlawful, and it is time for the demonstrators to go home because their point has been made.
“I think you’re going to see in the next day or so some initiatives from the Conservatives that are going to hopefully convince these folks that their point has been made,” Liepert told reporters Wednesday.

Belligerent men in big trucks given keys to nation's capital

Full text: Here’s what activists of all kinds can learn from the Ottawa occupation: in order to maximize media exposure and political impact at your future protests, be sure to arrive in trucks and be obnoxious.
Also: be right-wing.
It’s hard to imagine what other lessons to draw from the farcically lenient treatment of the “freedom” convoy that has effectively taken Ottawa hostage for almost two weeks.
Residents of the nation’s capital have been subjected to a rare and curious phenomenon that could be dubbed “police docility.” It wasn’t as if police were caught off-guard; convoy organizers had signalled their aggressive intentions.
Before the convoy left B.C., Patrick King, a long-time far-right activist (with no apparent trucking experience), told a Christian talk show that the convoy “ plans to shut down Ottawa .”
So Ottawa police had plenty of time to take basic police actions — like putting up concrete barriers — which would have prevented the men in large trucks from driving right up to the Parliament Buildings and the Prime Minister’s Office and deciding that that was a nice place to park.
Having met no resistance as they secured the finest parking spots in Ottawa, the foreign-funded truckers behaved like they had just been handed the keys to the city, which in a way they had.
They settled in, built a command centre and a dining area with well-equipped kitchen, brought in barbecues, generators, bouncy castles, saunas and vast supplies of fuel. They then exercised their new-found freedom by ripping masks off local residents, who had the audacity to try to protect themselves from a virus that’s killed 5.7 million people worldwide.
The occupation represents an abject failure by the Ottawa police — as well as by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Ontario Premier Doug Ford, both of whom have been fearful of triggering a confrontation that might antagonize right-wingers in Western Canada and rural Ontario.
By allowing the convoy to be coddled like this, Trudeau and Ford have given the freedom-bullies a sense of their own importance that is as oversized as their trucks.
In an online video he posted last August, Patrick King, the far-right activist, was angry and venomous, boasting he had a criminal record “the size of my f — cking arm. I am not a nice person.” King continued heatedly: “I’ve had just about enough. You have no idea what’s coming … Wait till the real bullets start flying.”
But by last week, speaking from a “command centre” at an “undisclosed location” in occupied Ottawa, King’s tone had turned from anger to jubilation : “Guys, I can’t believe how friggin’ amazing this is! The police last night — we’ve got videos of it — the police were carrying hot food to the truck drivers … we moved in 80 trucks last night … I’m having the time of my life … I can’t stop laughing because this is so awesome.”
No wonder the far-right activist is giddy, pinching himself to make sure his dreams really have come true.
Only last September, the far-right and its anti-vax crusade was repudiated by Canadians in the federal election, when the People’s Party failed to win a single seat.
Now, with a 12-day occupation of the nation’s capital under their belts, the freedom-bullies have been catapulted to the centre of the national stage, looking like a force that’ll have to be reckoned with in the future. Diane Deans, chair of the Ottawa Police Services Board, declared: “This is a nation-wide insurrection.”
No, it isn’t. It’s just a small group of belligerent men with very big trucks.
I’ve been part of much larger demonstrations that got a fraction of the attention. If these guys hadn’t been handed such an easy win in Ottawa, they — and their cause — would have likely gotten no more than a few minutes airtime on the national news.
Well done, Canadian authorities.

Full text: The province's housing task force has released a set of 55 sweeping recommendations that, if implemented, would overhaul virtually every aspect of Ontario's housing system, from zoning and development charges to heritage designations and planning appeal rules.
The proposals are aimed at ending the province's housing crisis by enabling the construction of 1.5 million homes in the next decade, says the task force report released Tuesday.
Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Steve Clark said bold action is needed if Ontario is going to reach that target. Even though there were 81,000 homes built last year, "we're going to have to build a lot more housing units a lot faster," he said.
The recommendations include putting an end to exclusionary zoning that shuts multi-family housing out of single-family residential neighbourhoods in about 70 per cent of Toronto.
The task force also proposes ending the height restrictions on skyscrapers immediately near transit stations if city zoning doesn't accommodate the province's density targets within two years.
Municipal heritage designations would be prohibited once a development application has been filed for property and municipalities would have to pay property owners for the loss of value if their property is designated.
Property taxes on purpose-built rental buildings, which can be up to 2.5 times higher, would be aligned with houses and condos to encourage investors to build more rental apartments.
Clark says he has time to act on the recommendations before the June election and that he hasn't ruled out any of the task force proposals. But he plans to solicit feedback from municipalities.
He said he is aware some of the recommendations, including those that would allow more units on existing single-family lots, will be challenging.
"Municipalities are certainly aware that this is one option that we have on the table and we've had a very positive and constructive response," he said.
Among the other proposals is modernizing the Ontario Building Code and allowing for timber construction of buildings up to 12 storeys instead of the current limit of six. The task force recommended that development consultations should be limited to a maximum set out in the Planning Act and that a backlog of 1,000 cases needed clearing from the Ontario Land Tribunal.
Development charges and cash-in-lieu for parks would be waived for all residential infill homes up to 10 units or for any housing that doesn't require new infrastructure. Projects with a guarantee of affordability for 40 years would also be exempt from those charges.
The recommendations on Tuesday come as Ontario home prices soared to an average of $923,000 last year from $329,000 in 2011. In the same decade, incomes rose only 38 per cent.
The report notes that Toronto's population density falls well below those of other global cities with 450 people per square kilometre on average compared with 1,800 in London and 1,700 in New York.
The nine-member task force, chaired by Jake Lawrence, CEO of Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, included real estate industry experts, developers, an academic, an Aboriginal housing expert and a representative of Habitat for Humanity.
When the committee was announced it drew criticism from at least one academic, the Ontario NDP and Green Party for being weighted toward the real estate and development industries.

Ford wants to scrap licence plate stickers

Full text: Premier Doug Ford is test-driving a plan to eliminate licence plate renewal stickers to save motorists up to $120 annually, the Star has learned.
The proposal, which would cost the treasury more than $1 billion a year because there are about 8.5 million vehicles registered in Ontario, has not been finalized.
But it could help the Progressive Conservatives' re-election campaign in the June 2 vote.
Sources, speaking confidentially in order to discuss internal deliberations, say the plan was well-received by ministers when it was shared with cabinet last week.
Transportation Minister Caroline Mulroney's office was tight-lipped about the measure, which is expected to be introduced through legislation this spring and be in place before the election.
"Our government is considering a number of options to cut costs for Ontarians," Mulroney's office said in a carefully worded statement Monday.
With rising inflation and skyrocketing fuel costs, the Tories are looking at ways to save money for pandemic-weary Ontario voters - especially those on fixed incomes, such as seniors.
The change would also dovetail with Ford's push to build the 60-kilometre Highway 413 between Milton and Vaughan, and the 16.2-kilometre Bradford Bypass linking Highways 400 and 404.
New highways and making it cheaper to drive on them should appeal to commuters in the Greater Toronto Area, home to the ridings that traditionally determine the winner of Ontario elections.
While voters who don't own motorcycles, cars, SUVs and trucks would not benefit, the Tories emphasize Queen's Park has partnered with Ottawa and municipalities to spend tens of billions of dollars on public transit.
That includes the TTC's Ontario Line, the Eglinton Crosstown West LRT, as well as the Scarborough and Yonge North subway extensions.
However, eliminating the licence fees, which range from $12 for mopeds to $120 for passenger vehicles in southern Ontario, will be complicated as well as costly.
That's because the government is still determining how to refund hundreds of millions of dollars to motorists who have already renewed their tags.
"It's not as easy as you'd think," said an insider, noting many Ontario residents renew their stickers for the maximum two years at a time for $240.
Motorists would still pay a one-time fee of around $20 for a new licence plate, but the annual renewal process would be scrapped, reducing lineups at Service Ontario offices and kiosks.
In 2018, Ford eliminated the controversial Drive Clean program, which required tests and, in some cases, repairs for passen-ger vehicles.
That initiative was one of the most popular moves of his shaky rookie year as premier.
"This government is reducing the burden on residents and families who own a car," Ford said at the time.
Launched by former Conservative premier Mike Harris in 1999, Drive Clean became a nuisance for Ontario motorists, since most vehicles passed the emissions tests.
Even though former premier Kathleen Wynne's Liberals cancelled the $30 test fee in 2017, the province was still footing the $40-million annual smog-testing tab.
Insiders say the government is quietly consulting with police and municipalities to determine the consequences of getting rid of licence plate stickers.
A lot of police resources are used pulling over people driving with expired plates.
There have been instances of officers using the stickers as an excuse to target Black motorists or other visible minorities.
But the province and municipalities have also relied upon the renewals to collect unpaid traffic and parking fines, so those details still must be worked out.
After the COVID-19 pandemic hit Ontario in March 2020, Ford announced an extension on the expiry dates of all government identification - such as driver's licenses and OHIP cards - as well as plate stickers.
That was to curb the spread of the virus by preventing people from gathering at crowded Service Ontario outlets.
Licence plate changes have been a source of political embarrassment for the Tories in the past.
In the 2019 budget, the government announced with much fanfare that the white Ontario plates dating back to 1973 would be changed to Conservative blue.
The new two-tone blue plates, however, were illegible in some light conditions and Ford was forced to abandon them in 2020 after about 145,000 had been manufactured.

Liberal MP breaks with Justin Trudeau over COVID-19 vaccinations and restrictions

Full text: OTTAWA—In a striking break with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a backbench Liberal MP has accused his party of stoking divisions and using the pandemic for political gain.
It was the first crack in Liberal party unity amid a backlash against COVID-19 health measures that has exposed differences within the Conservative party and gripped Canada’s capital city, even as some provinces move to relax pandemic restrictions.
Joël Lightbound, the MP for the Quebec City riding of Louis-Hébert, echoed the criticism of opposition Conservatives on Tuesday, when he expressed sympathy for some “Freedom Convoy” demonstrators who want to lift all pandemic health measures and have occupied the streets around Parliament Hill for almost two weeks.
Though he didn’t name anyone, Lightbound said “quite a few” Liberal MPs share his concerns with the Liberal government’s stance on COVID-19 health measures.
“I can’t help but notice with regret that both the tone and the policies of my government changed drastically on the eve — and during — the last election campaign,” said Lightbound, who later resigned as chair of the Liberals’ Quebec caucus.
“From a positive and unifying approach, a decision was made to wedge, to divide and to stigmatize. I fear that this politicization of the pandemic risks undermining the public’s trust in our public health institutions.”
During the federal election last summer, Trudeau and Liberal MPs faced aggressive protesters who denounced the government’s vaccine mandates. Trudeau condemned them at the time as “anti-vaxxer mobs.”
And before the so-called “Freedom Convoy” protesters launched demonstrations across the country — paralyzing downtown Ottawa and blockading border crossings in southwestern Ontario and Alberta — Trudeau said they were part of a “fringe minority” who held “unacceptable views.”
Such comments drew rebukes from the Conservative opposition, who have seen their own divisions over the convoy protests. Several Tory MPs, including Interim Leader Candice Bergen, have conveyed support for the demonstrations. Yet Quebec MP Pierre-Paul Hus called last week for the protest to end, while Nunavut Sen. Dennis Patterson left the Conservative caucus over the party’s failure to condemn the convoy.
One point on which the Tories are united is their longtime argument that the Liberal government has divided Canadians with vaccine mandates for domestic air travellers, federal bureaucrats and cross-border truckers.
The vaccine requirement for that last group sparked the ongoing occupation in the nation’s capital — something local officials have called a “siege” after widespread reports of harassment, hate crimes and property damage.
While Lightbound said Tuesday that he condemns symbols of hate and extremism like the Confederate flags and swastikas spotted in Ottawa, he argued governments shouldn’t “dismiss” or “demonize” protesters expressing what he sees as legitimate concerns with the persistence of COVID-19 vaccine mandates and other restrictions.
He cited concerns about the mental health impacts of social isolation on children and seniors, as well as the economic impacts of lockdowns on businesses. He also echoed the language of protesters who allege there is “segregation” in Canadian society between people who are vaccinated against COVID-19 and those who are not.
“Where the hell are we heading here in Canada? I think there lies the frustration,” he said, describing what he called public concern about vaccination passports and mandates being “normalized.”
He called on the federal government to develop a “road map” for lifting restrictions, expressed doubt that the vaccine mandate for cross-border truckers is justified by scientific evidence, and questioned why Trudeau has ruled out increasing federal health transfers — a key and long-standing demand of all provinces — until the pandemic is over.
On his way into the Commons for question period Tuesday, Trudeau said he understood the frustration but defended vaccine mandates as the path out of the pandemic.
“We’re all sick and tired of restrictions, of mandates, of having to make sacrifices, of not being able to do the things we love,” the prime minister said.
“Mandates are the way to avoid further restrictions … As Canadians have gotten vaccinated, we’ve been able to get through things. So this team is going to stay focused on doing exactly that.”
Marc Miller, the Liberal Crown-Indigenous relations minister, was more pointed. Describing politics as a “team sport,” Miller suggested Lightbound should know better than to express such views publicly.
He also disagreed with Lightbound’s assertion that the Liberal government’s COVID-19 policies are divisive.
“I think saving lives is much more than a political debate,” Miller said. “It’s something we’ve been relentless in doing over the last two years, and if Canadians think that’s politicizing the debate, I think they need to screw their heads on better,” Miller said.
Steven MacKinnon, the Liberal government whip, said he spoke with Lightbound Tuesday afternoon about his dissenting views.
“He has expressed disagreements with government policy. Subsequently, Mr. Lightbound has resigned as chair of the Quebec Liberal Caucus. He has expressed clear confidence in the government and remains a member of the Liberal caucus,” MacKinnon wrote in a Twitter statement.
Several members of the Conservative party — which is calling for an end to vaccine mandates and has similarly accused the Trudeau Liberals of politicizing the issue — commended Lightbound for his remarks.
“We are not alone! Finally Liberals are breaking ranks with Trudeau and calling for an end to the discriminatory mandates,” Alberta Conservative MP Chris Warkentin posted on Facebook.
Outside Parliament along Wellington Street, protesters danced and walked holding flags and placards with slogans now familiar throughout Ottawa, including claims that Trudeau committed “treason” and various denunciations of the “fake news” and vaccine mandates.
Standing near the fenced-in National War Memorial, Sylvain Bouchard welcomed Lightbound’s comments and agreed the pandemic has been divisive. Since he decided to join the convoy protests last weekend, Bouchard said some members of his family no longer want to speak with him. He hoped the protests had created a space for Canadians who share his skepticism of COVID-19 health restrictions to speak out.
“I think more and more people will come out of the shadows and be a little bit more brave,” he said.
Lightbound’s objection to his government’s pandemic response comes as several provinces move to wind down their own restrictions and vaccine policies.
Later Tuesday, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney announced his province’s plan to scrap vaccination passports that same night, saying public health restrictions had led to “terrible division, even amongst family and friends.”
Earlier in the day, Saskatchewan announced its intent to end proof of vaccination requirements to enter certain indoor venues by Feb. 14., while Quebec shared a staged reopening plan starting this weekend, with the potential to reconsider mask mandates and vaccine passports in mid-March.

Full text: TORONTO - Ontario's fiscal watchdog predicts smaller budget deficits over the next few years compared to those projected by the government last fall, saying the more positive outlook is due to an improved revenue forecast.
The Financial Accountability Office issued a report Tuesday that said Ontario's deficit is expected to decline to $2.8 billion by the end of the 2023-24 fiscal year, down from $16 billion this fiscal year.
That's compared to the government's predicted budget deficit of $11.4 billion.
Financial Accountability Officer Peter Weltman said the difference "is largely due to a significant change in the revenue forecast."
"That's really where the bulk of this comes from," Weltman said at a virtual news conference. The report also notes that a "lower projection for interest on debt expense" by the watchdog's office contributed to the $8.6 billion difference.
In an interview, Weltman said his office had more time than the government to see how the economy has rebounded from COVID-19 over the past months, noting that it's been difficult to nail down reasonable economic forecasts during the pandemic.
The watchdog report projects that revenues will be $7.6 billion higher by 2023-24 than figures in the government's plan.
The report makes total spending projections similar to the government's for the fiscal year ending in 2024. But it highlights shortfalls for programs in health, education, justice, postsecondary education and social services in government's plan, which it says could be offset using "significant unallocated funds."
Weltman said a lot of the unallocated funds are "COVID-earmarked money" that didn't have a specified allocation as of Jan. 20. The numbers are not included in the watchdog's projections until the government specifies its plans for the money, and Weltman said "the government can do really what it wants to do" with the funds.
"(Government) can create new programs, it can enhance existing programs, it can fund those programs shortfalls or it could just hold on to it and reduce the deficit," he said.
A spokeswoman for Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy described the unallocated funds noted in the watchdog's report as "contingency funding" that the government has built into its fiscal plans during the pandemic.
"The report itself acknowledges that 'unallocated funds could be used to fund new programs, enhance existing programs,'" Emily Hogeveen said in an emailed statement.
"Contingency funding is regularly deployed, as needed, in this manner."
Hogeveen also said the government presented "faster growth and slower growth economic scenarios" in its last fiscal update to give Ontarians more transparency.
The Financial Accountability Office's report comes ahead of the Progressive Conservative government's election-year budget that's expected to come before the end of next month.
The Opposition New Democrats raised concerns about the report showing lack of funding in areas like health and the potential for unannounced tax cuts, which the watchdog report said could explain the difference between its tax revenue projections and the government's.
"If the Financial Accountability Officer is right, (Premier Doug Ford) is planning to take even more away from our health care, our children's schools and our social services and use that money for corporate tax cuts for his big box buddies," NDP finance critic Catherine Fife said in a written statement. "We cannot give him a chance to do that."
Mike Schreiner, leader of the provincial Greens, said the Ford should clarify his plans for social services in light of the shortfalls pointed out in the report.
"It's inexcusable to leave Ontarians out to dry at a time when people and businesses are already struggling so much," Schreiner said in a statement. "It's time for Doug Ford to be honest about his plans and start making the investments needed for a green and caring recovery."
Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca highlighted the wide gap between the watchdog's and government's forecasts.
"The government's revenue forecasts were off by billions and billions of dollars," he said in a written statement. "Their poor financial planning has needlessly starved our hospitals and schools at a time when they needed support the most."
This report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 8, 2022.

Doug Ford may scrap renewal fees for Ontario licence plates

Full text: Premier Doug Ford is test-driving a plan to eliminate licence plate renewal stickers to save motorists up to $120 annually, the Star has learned.
The proposal, which would cost the treasury more than $1 billion a year because there are about 8.5 million vehicles registered in Ontario, has not been finalized.
But it could help the Progressive Conservatives’ re-election campaign in the June 2 vote.
Sources, speaking confidentially in order to discuss internal deliberations, say the plan was well-received by ministers when it was shared with cabinet last week.
Transportation Minister Caroline Mulroney’s office was tight-lipped about the measure, which is expected to be introduced through legislation this spring and be in place before the election.
“Our government is considering a number of options to cut costs for Ontarians,” Mulroney’s office said in a carefully worded statement Monday.
With rising inflation and skyrocketing fuel costs, the Tories are looking at ways to save money for pandemic-weary Ontario voters — especially those on fixed incomes, such as seniors.
The change would also dovetail with Ford’s push to build the 60-kilometre Highway 413 between Milton and Vaughan, and the 16.2-kilometre Bradford Bypass linking Highways 400 and 404.
New highways and making it cheaper to drive on them should appeal to commuters in the Greater Toronto Area, home to the ridings that traditionally determine the winner of Ontario elections.
While voters who don’t own motorcycles, cars, SUVs and trucks would not benefit, the Tories emphasize Queen’s Park has partnered with Ottawa and municipalities to spend tens of billions of dollars on public transit.
That includes the TTC’s Ontario Line, the Eglinton Crosstown West LRT, as well as the Scarborough and Yonge North subway extensions.
However, eliminating the licence fees, which range from $12 for mopeds to $120 for passenger vehicles in southern Ontario, will be complicated as well as costly.
That’s because the government is still determining how to refund hundreds of millions of dollars to motorists who have already renewed their tags.
“It’s not as easy as you’d think,” said an insider, noting many Ontario residents renew their stickers for the maximum two years at a time for $240.
Motorists would still pay a one-time fee of around $20 for a new licence plate, but the annual renewal process would be scrapped, reducing lineups at Service Ontario offices and kiosks.
In 2018, Ford eliminated the controversial Drive Clean program , which required tests and, in some cases, repairs for passenger vehicles.
That initiative was one of the most popular moves of his shaky rookie year as premier.
“This government is reducing the burden on residents and families who own a car,” Ford said at the time.
Launched by former Conservative premier Mike Harris in 1999, Drive Clean became a nuisance for Ontario motorists, since most vehicles passed the emissions tests.
Even though former premier Kathleen Wynne’s Liberals cancelled the $30 test fee in 2017, the province was still footing the $40-million annual smog-testing tab.
Insiders say the government is quietly consulting with police and municipalities to determine the consequences of getting rid of licence plate stickers.
A lot of police resources are used pulling over people driving with expired plates. There have been instances of officers using the stickers as an excuse to target Black motorists or other visible minorities .
But the province and municipalities have also relied upon the renewals to collect unpaid traffic and parking fines, so those details still must be worked out.
After the COVID-19 pandemic hit Ontario in March 2020, Ford announced an extension on the expiry dates of all government identification — such as driver’s licenses and OHIP cards — as well as plate stickers.
That was to curb the spread of the virus by preventing people from gathering at crowded Service Ontario outlets.
Licence plate changes have been a source of political embarrassment for the Tories in the past.
In the 2019 budget , the government announced with much fanfare that the white Ontario plates dating back to 1973 would be changed to Conservative blue.
The new two-tone blue plates , however, were illegible in some light conditions and Ford was forced to abandon them in 2020 after about 145,000 had been manufactured.

Full text: A topsy-turvy time for federal Conservatives enters a new phase Wednesday with interim leader Candice Bergen set to preside over the first formal gathering of MPs since they dumped Erin O'Toole last week.
But while Conservatives put forward a united call Tuesday for the end of COVID-19 vaccination mandates - buoyed by a Liberal MP breaking ranks with the government over the issue - fundamental challenges remain behind the scenes.
One will be visible Wednesday just through the windows of the room where the Tory caucus usually meets: truckers who have been blocking major streets around Parliament Hill for 12 days and show no signs of going home.
Ahead of the protesters' arrival in Ottawa, Conservative caucus members were publicly united in their support for the truckers' cause - that vaccination mandates for cross-border drivers were unfair and would cripple their industry.
Even as the trucks rolled in - and racist, destructive and harassing behaviour popped up during the early days - many remained aligned with them; two days before O'Toole got the boot and she took over, Bergen sat down for dinner with two of those camping out in downtown Ottawa.
But as the demonstrators have dug in, and as their impact on the day-to-day movement of Ottawa residents has taken its toll, the tone of the response from some Tories is shifting.
What's happening is no longer a protest but a blockade, and that's beyond the scope of people's fundamental right to have their voices heard, said longtime Tory MP Michael Chong.
The protesters need to go home, Chong said, but the politicians need to think deeply about the frustration that brought the "Freedom Convoy" to Parliament Hill.
"We have gotten to this place because we have not been serious. We have not been serious about the rule of law," he said during an emergency debate on the issue in the House of Commons.
"We have not been serious about ensuring our democratic institutions reflect the diversity of views in this country. We have not been serious about domestic policy. We have not been serious about foreign policy. It is time we got serious."
The speech immediately set Tory tongues wagging about whether Chong would to take another run at the party leadership, as he did in 2017. Asked Tuesday, the member for Wellington-Halton Hills would only tell the Star that he is thinking about how he can best serve his country.
Meanwhile, Pierre Poilievre, the party's finance critic, is expected to be shuffled out of that job after launching his campaign to lead the party. Leadership contenders generally don't get to hold critic positions that would give them a higher profile during the race.
In a post-election review conducted for the party, one recommendation was to make memberships free to expand the party's base, but it's unlikely that recommendation - or any other from the review - will be implemented on Bergen's watch.
"An interim leader is limited in what they can do to change the party or the mechanics - that's not the job they were elected to do," said Garry Keller, who served as chief of staff to Rona Ambrose when she was interim leader.
"The job is to provide a steady hand on the wheel and turn the party over in better shape than when they came into the position."
Bergen has already moved swiftly to put her stamp on the front benches of the party, pushing aside long-time O'Toole loyalists in favour of a fresh team. A larger shuffle of critics prompted by Poilievre's move is likely as well.
Another issue potentially on the table for Wednesday's meeting is whether Bergen will bring Sen. Denise Batters back into the fold. Batters was kicked out of caucus by O'Toole for demanding a leadership review, and her dismissal exacerbated tensions within the party's ranks.
When it comes to charting a policy path forward for the party, Bergen will also be navigating a tricky course, said Keller.
"She has a delicate balancing act: reflect where the caucus and party is at as in policy pronouncements and in communications, but not to make radical policy decisions that have major impacts on platform."

Liberal MP breaks with Trudeau: Quebec member says Ottawa shouldn't dismiss concerns of those who want health measures lifted

Full text: In a striking break with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a backbench Liberal MP has accused his party of stoking divisions and using the pandemic for political gain.
It was the first crack in Liberal party unity amid a backlash against COVID-19 health measures that has exposed differences within the Conservative party and gripped Canada's capital city, even as some provinces move to relax pandemic restrictions.
Joël Lightbound, the MP for the Quebec City riding of Louis-Hébert, echoed the criticism of opposition Conservatives on Tuesday, when he expressed sympathy for some "Freedom Convoy" demonstrators who want to lift all pandemic health measures and have occupied the streets around Parliament Hill for almost two weeks.
Though he didn't name anyone, Lightbound said "quite a few" Liberal MPs share his concerns with the Liberal government's stance on COVID-19 health measures.
"I can't help but notice with regret that both the tone and the policies of my government changed drastically on the eve - and during - the last election campaign," said Lightbound, who later resigned as chair of the Liberals' Quebec caucus.
"From a positive and unifying approach, a decision was made to wedge, to divide and to stigmatize. I fear that this politicization of the pandemic risks undermining the public's trust in our public health institutions."
During the federal election last summer, Trudeau and Liberal MPs faced aggressive protesters who denounced the government's vaccine mandates. Trudeau condemned them at the time as "anti-vaxxer mobs."
And before the so-called "Freedom Convoy" protesters launched demonstrations across the country - paralyzing downtown Ottawa and blockading border crossings in southwestern Ontario and Alberta - Trudeau said they were part of a "fringe minority" who held "unacceptable views."
Such comments drew rebukes from the Conservative opposition, who have seen their own divisions over the convoy protests. Several Tory MPs, including Interim Leader Candice Bergen, have conveyed support for the demonstrations. Yet Quebec MP Pierre-Paul Hus called last week for the protest to end, while Nunavut Sen. Dennis Patterson left the Conservative caucus over the party's failure to condemn the convoy.
One point on which the Tories are united is their longtime argument that the Liberal government has divided Canadians with vaccine mandates for domestic air travellers, federal bureaucrats and cross-border truckers.
The vaccine requirement for that last group sparked the ongoing occupation in the nation's capital - something local officials have called a "siege" after widespread reports of harassment, hate crimes and property damage.
While Lightbound said Tuesday that he condemns symbols of hate and extremism like the Confederate flags and swastikas spotted in Ottawa, he argued governments shouldn't "dismiss" or "demonize" protesters expressing what he sees as legitimate concerns with the persistence of COVID-19 vaccine mandates and other restrictions.
He cited concerns about the mental health impacts of social isolation on children and seniors, as well as the economic impacts of lockdowns on businesses. He also echoed the language of protesters who allege there is "segregation" in Canadian society between people who are vaccinated against COVID-19 and those who are not.
"Where the hell are we heading here in Canada? I think there lies the frustration," he said, describing what he called public concern about vaccination passports and mandates being "normalized."
He called on the federal government to develop a "road map" for lifting restrictions, expressed doubt that the vaccine mandate for cross-border truckers is justified by scientific evidence, and questioned why Trudeau has ruled out increasing federal health transfers - a key and long-standing demand of all provinces - until the pandemic is over.
On his way into the Commons for question period Tuesday, Trudeau said he understood the frustration but defended vaccine mandates as the path out of the pandemic.
"We're all sick and tired of restrictions, of mandates, of having to make sacrifices, of not being able to do the things we love," the prime minister said.
"Mandates are the way to avoid further restrictions ... As Canadians have gotten vaccinated, we've been able to get through things. So this team is going to stay focused on doing exactly that."
Marc Miller, the Liberal Crown-Indigenous relations minister, was more pointed. Describing politics as a "team sport," Miller suggested Lightbound should know better than to express such views publicly.
He also disagreed with Lightbound's assertion that the Liberal government's COVID-19 policies are divisive.
"I think saving lives is much more than a political debate," Miller said. "It's something we've been relentless in doing over the last two years, and if Canadians think that's politicizing the debate, I think they need to screw their heads on better," Miller said.
Steven MacKinnon, the Liberal government whip, said he spoke with Lightbound Tuesday afternoon about his dissenting views.
"He has expressed disagreements with government policy. Subsequently, Mr. Lightbound has resigned as chair of the Quebec Liberal Caucus. He has expressed clear confidence in the government and remains a member of the Liberal caucus," MacKinnon wrote in a Twitter statement.
Several members of the Conservative party - which is calling for an end to vaccine mandates and has similarly accused the Trudeau Liberals of politicizing the issue - commended Lightbound for his remarks.
"We are not alone! Finally Liberals are breaking ranks with Trudeau and calling for an end to the discriminatory mandates," Alberta Conservative MP Chris Warkentin posted on Facebook.
Standing near the fenced-in National War Memorial, Sylvain Bouchard welcomed Lightbound's comments and agreed the pandemic has been divisive. Since he decided to join the convoy protests last weekend, Bouchard said some members of his family no longer want to speak with him. He hoped the protests had created a space for Canadians who share his skepticism of COVID-19 health restrictions to speak out.
"I think more and more people will come out of the shadows and be a little bit more brave," he said.

Rivals slam Ford's licence plate plan: Premier proposing to eliminate renewal stickers

Full text: It's a $1-billion sticker shock.
Premier Doug Ford's proposal to eliminate licence plate renewal stickers - which would save motorists up to $120 annually - is being panned by his political opponents.
As disclosed by the Star on Monday, the Progressive Conservatives are preparing a plan to scrap the yearly tags for 8.5 million vehicles in Ontario, which would cost the treasury more than $1 billion.
With legislation expected this spring so the fees would be lifted before the June 2 election, Transportation Minister Caroline Mulroney's office did not deny it was coming.
"Our government is considering a number of options to cut costs for Ontarians," Mulroney's office told the Star on Monday.
But NDP MPP Jennifer French (Oshawa) reminded the Tories what happened last time they tackled licence plates.
"Doug Ford already failed spectacularly at one licence plate project," said French, referring to the government's bungled 2019 bid to switch the traditionally white plates to Tory blue.
That scheme was abandoned in 2020 after it emerged the new plates were illegible to police and other motorists in some light conditions.
"Who knows if Ford will follow through or if this is just a shameless pre-election trial balloon," added the New Democrat.
"The bottom line for everyday people is that under Doug Ford, the cost of living in Ontario has ballooned on everything from the price of gas to food," said French.
"It's long past due that Doug Ford do something about major costs like housing, child care and hydro bills."
Green Leader Mike Schreiner said there are more effective - and environmentally sensitive - ways to help Ontarians' pocketbooks.
"The premier should bring back the electric vehicle rebates he cancelled (in 2018) if wants to make life more affordable," said Schreiner.
"If he wants to make driving cheaper for people, going electric is the way to go," he said, noting it costs him $10 in electricity to charge his Chevrolet Bolt, compared to $100 to fill up many vehicles with gasoline.
Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca's office declined to comment, saying it would "weigh in when and if it is real."
The rising cost of fuel is one reason why the Tories are pushing the elimination of annual licence tags.
But scrapping the fees, ranging from $12 for mopeds to $120 for passenger vehicles, will be complicated because the government is still working out how to refund hundreds of millions of dollars to motorists who renewed their stickers last year for 2023.
Drivers would still pay a one-time fee of around $20 for a new licence plate.
The government is in discussions with police and municipalities to determine the impact of getting rid of the stickers.

Full text: Ontario's Housing Affordability Task Force makes scant mention of affordable housing construction or the speculation and investment buying many believe are driving up home prices.
But among its 55 recommendations released Tuesday, critics and politicians agreed the proposal to end exclusionary zoning - the restriction that shuts off 70 per cent of Toronto's residential land to anything but single-family homes - will be key to solving the housing crisis. The proposal will almost certainly be controversial with homeowners. But the transition has already begun, with the introduction of policies permitting laneway, garden-suite and multiplex housing in those neighbourhoods, said Mayor John Tory.
Without introducing that gentle densification, he said, "We simply will not be able to sustain the growth in an equitable and fair manner and make sure everybody can find the city to be a home for them."
Tory said the city will be able to persuade residents the proposal is in the best interest of maintaining stable neighbourhoods and their children's housing futures.
"Stable neighbourhoods don't necessarily have to mean static neighbourhoods," he said. It is ironic, added the mayor, that large houses now owned by one family used to be houses in which there were two or three flats.
Removing single-family zoning is just part of a vast public planning makeover proposed in the report of the Ontario Housing Affordability Task Force released Tuesday. It says Ontario needs to build 1.5 million houses in 10 years.
The task force says municipalities will have to open established neighbourhoods to more affordable units, take the politics out of development approvals and encourage more rentals and modern construction techniques and materials.
It's not clear whether the province will adopt any or all of the recommendations. Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Steve Clark said on Monday that he has time to act on the findings before the June 2 election.
Toronto City Coun. Mike Colle, who was behind a motion at city council last month to ask the province to implement anti-flipping and speculation measures, said his reading of the report was "a humungous buffet for developers," with "no requirements for affordability whatsoever."
"Unless you put in some kind of restrictions, (speculators) will just see another opportunity to make windfall profits for years to come," said the former Liberal MPP. Meantime, he said, residents will be taking out huge mortgages they can ill afford.
NDP housing critic Jessica Bell said zoning reform is "a smart and sustainable approach that will allow for the construction of more affordable townhomes, duplexes and triplexes." Those are typically $500,000 cheaper than a semi-detached house and more in line with what a family can afford, she said.
But, she said, there are red flags among the recommendations, notably the proposal to expand municipal boundaries into nonenvironmentally protected areas, putting urban sprawl on farmland.
"It is not sustainable," she said. "It locks people into epic, soul-destroying two-hour commutes. And it is expensive for municipalities to provide the infrastructure and the services to new subdivisions."
Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner called it a "significant contradiction" that the report talks about protecting farmland and the environmentally sensitive greenbelt, while also suggesting housing be aligned with Highway 413, which, "is going to supercharge sprawl and supercharge climate pollution."
Schreiner said the task force was focused entirely on the private sector's role in bolstering housing supply rather than assigning a role to the provincial and federal governments.
"Part of why you're seeing a housing affordability crisis is that both the provincial and federal levels of government got out of housing in the mid-1990s. The housing affordability crisis has been getting worse every year since then," he said.
Real estate expert John Pasalis says there are some good things in the report, including a limit on public consultations that are used to stonewall housing development. But he's not convinced the task force's proposals will lead to increased affordability. Nor is it entirely realistic.
"We're building 65,000 homes (a year) on average in Ontario. How do you get to 150,000," he said. "We're not going to more than double our housing completions in 10 years. You can't solve that problem with a two-month task force."
He also doesn't believe the private sector will provide more affordable rental housing. "Builders are building what's most lucrative and it's higher-end rentals and not because they're evil people but because they're businesses and they want to make a profit," he said.
The composition of the task force and its homebuilding agenda completely missed any discussion of the other ingredients it takes to build a community, said Cathie Macdonald, co-chair of the Federation of North Toronto Residents' Associations. "It's complicated. It's not just churning out development applications," she said.

NDP's Andrea Horwath sails through provincial leadership vote

Full text: With four months until the June 2 election, the NDP’s Andrea Horwath easily passed a leadership review with 85 per cent support Sunday in the wake of controversy over a candidate dropped last week .
The vote had been delayed for months and took place at a virtual convention that was supposed to be held in-person in her hometown of Hamilton, but was moved online because of the unexpected Omicron wave of COVID-19.
“This isn’t about me. This is about finally giving everyday Ontarians a government that’s going to put them first,” Horwath said in a statement after the tally was released.
The mandatory leadership review was the fourth of her tenure since 2009 and her highest support level to date, narrowly beating a result of 84 per cent after the 2018 election that saw the NDP reach 40 seats and become the official opposition following the collapse of the Liberals.
Horwath said New Democrats are well positioned to defeat Premier Doug Ford over his handling of the pandemic, which she said has resulted in a high death toll in nursing homes, the occupation of downtown Ottawa by protesters, and other fumbles.
“We can get it done,” she said in a line used repeatedly during a half-hour speech to 1,100 delegates.
“This is the guy who bought (gasoline pump) stickers that didn’t stick ... guy who rolled out licence plates you couldn’t read .”
Opposition parties have vowed not to support a Ford minority if that’s what voters send to Queen’s Park. Current polls suggest that is a likely option with the Liberals rebounding. The 338Canada polling simulator updated Feb. 2 suggests the Tories would win 59 seats, the Liberals 35, the NDP 29 and the Greens one if the election was held today.
NDP delegates cast their leadership ballots six days after Horwath was forced to dismiss a recently recruited “star” candidate, former Ajax mayor Steve Parish, for his advocacy in naming a street in the eastern GTA suburb for Nazi naval commander Hans Langdorff.
Although the street name was removed two years ago, Parish opposed the change and that prompted blowback from within Horwath’s caucus as well as in the community.
“Naming streets after Nazis is an obvious clear no. There are no excuses,” wrote MPP Rima Berns-McGown (Beaches-East York).
At a news conference before the review vote was announced, Horwath maintained the party has a thorough candidate vetting process in place for the spring election.
She acknowledged not acting quickly enough on two 2018 candidates that caused the party trouble on the campaign trail — one who railed against wearing poppies on Remembrance Day as “a ritual of war glorification” and another accused of posting Nazi memes on Facebook .
Neither candidate was dropped and Horwath said a more thorough review should have been conducted.
“In the midst and throes of the campaign I don’t know that we took enough of that time.”
Correction — Feb. 7, 2022: As of Feb. 2, the 338Canada polling simulator suggested the Tories would win an election with 59 seats, the Liberals 35, the NDP 29 and the Greens one. This article previous reported incorrect data from the polling simulator.

Full text: Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson has declared a state of emergency in the city over ongoing trucker protests.
In a news release Sunday, the city said the decision, "reflects the serious danger and threat to the safety and security of residents posed by the ongoing demonstrations."
It also "highlights the need for support from other jurisdictions and levels of government," and will give the city more flexibility to procure supplies, the release added.
Frustration in the nation's capital has been mounting since what some are calling an occupation of the downtown core began over a week ago, with trucks blocking streets and horns blaring throughout the night.
Also on Sunday, Ottawa police announced anyone attempting to bring support such as gas, to demonstrators could be arrested, and said they'd issued more than 450 tickets since Saturday morning.
"Overnight, demonstrators exhibited extremely disruptive and unlawful behaviour, which presented risks to public safety and unacceptable distress for Ottawa residents," read a news release on the Ottawa Police website. "We continue to advise demonstrators not to enter Ottawa, and to go home."
Bylaw and police have issued tickets for things ranging from excessive noise, to fireworks, and stunt driving, according to the release.
Several large vehicles were towed including one stolen vehicle, the release added. Police there have responded to more than 650 calls and almost 100 criminal investigations have been opened.
A local hate crime hotline has also received more than 200 calls.
What began as a trucker convoy protesting COVID-19 public health restrictions and vaccine mandates reached several Canadian cities, Saturday, including Toronto, Edmonton, Halifax and Vancouver, but also faced some of its strongest resistance yet.
Ontario's Solicitor General Sylvia Jones congratulated the city of Toronto and Toronto police for "ensuring" the Saturday demonstration was safe, in an emailed statement, Sunday.
"I understand the Ottawa Police Service continues to express concerns about their ability to manage the ongoing occupation in their city," she added.
"Politicians at all levels cannot direct the police. To be clear: police services, including the Ottawa Police Service, have full discretion and extensive existing legislative authority under the Criminal Code to respond to and manage demonstrations and take enforcement action, as appropriate, against any individuals committing crimes in their jurisdiction."
More than 1,500 Ontario Provincial Police officers, as well as officers from other municipal police services and the RCMP, are on the ground in Ottawa, she said.
"While we cannot direct the police, we have provided the city of Ottawa everything they have asked for and will continue to provide whatever support they request," added Premier Doug Ford in a tweet.
A GoFundMe campaign supporting the convoy was shut down by the site Friday, after reports of alleged harassment, but fundraising has now shifted to a Christian platform hosted by GiveSendGo. Reporters spotted Nazi swastikas and Confederate flags last weekend in the Ottawa crowd, and police warned about possible weapons at the demonstrations there, arresting one man who allegedly tried to bring a gun.
Meanwhile, in Toronto, police announced that a 34-year-old man was arrested Saturday at Bedford Road and Bloor Street West for allegedly throwing dog poop at another person, and charged with assault with a weapon. Const. David Hopkinson of Toronto Police corporate communications said in an email that the "accused was not part of the demonstration" as far as he knows. "He was arrested at a protest but I'm not sure if that protest is part of the trucker protest," said Hopkinson, who declined to give further details as the matter will be going to court.
Hundreds of unmasked supporters wrapped in Canadian flags, chanting "freedom" and holding anti-media and anti-Trudeau signs gathered at Queen's Park on Saturday afternoon and jammed the intersection at Bloor Street West and Avenue Road, west to Bedford Road and east to Yonge Street with a few trucks and several cars and SUVs.
Horns blared for hours. Despite frigid temperatures dropping below -8 C, one man danced in only a thong and a Canadian flag atop a truck with a flag that read "Treason Trudeau."
But things wound down by the evening.
Toronto Police Chief James Ramer tweeted shortly after 9 p.m. the protesters and vehicles had "been safely moved out" and they "appreciated the co-operation" as they "opened and returned the intersection for safe use by residents and businesses."
Toronto police also arrested a 22-year-old man on Saturday for assault with a weapon, public mischief and allegedly setting off a smoke bomb.
By Sunday evening, Toronto's streets were quiet with no known protests.
"The Toronto Police Service will be working overnight to re-open road closures. We will maintain a visible police presence in the downtown core and will respond as necessary to keep the city safe," the police said in a tweet.

Full text: With four months until the June 2 election, the NDP's Andrea Horwath easily passed a leadership review with 85 per cent support Sunday in the wake of controversy over a candidate dropped last week.
The vote had been delayed for months and took place at a virtual convention that was supposed to be held in-person in her hometown of Hamilton, but was moved online because of the unexpected Omicron wave of COVID-19.
"This isn't about me. This is about finally giving everyday Ontarians a government that's going to put them first," Horwath said in a statement after the tally was released.
The mandatory leadership review was the fourth of her tenure since 2009 and her highest support level to date, narrowly beating a result of 84 per cent after the 2018 election that saw the NDP reach 40 seats and become the official Opposition following the collapse of the Liberals.
Horwath said New Democrats are well positioned to defeat Premier Doug Ford over his handling of the pandemic, which she said has resulted in a high death toll in nursing homes, the occupation of downtown Ottawa by protesters, and other fumbles.
"We can get it done," she said in a line used repeatedly during a half-hour speech to 1,100 delegates.
"This is the guy who bought (gasoline pump) stickers that didn't stick ... guy who rolled out licence plates you couldn't read."
Opposition parties have vowed not to support a Ford minority if that's what voters send to Queen's Park. Current polls suggest that is a likely option with the Liberals rebounding. The 338Canada polling simulator updated Feb. 2 suggests the Tories would win 61 seats, the Liberals 33, the NDP 29 and the Greens one if the election was held today.
NDP delegates cast their leadership ballots six days after Horwath was forced to dismiss a recently recruited "star" candidate, former Ajax mayor Steve Parish, for his advocacy in naming a street in the eastern GTA suburb for Nazi naval commander Hans Langdorff.
Although the street name was removed two years ago, Parish opposed the change and that prompted blowback from within Horwath's caucus as well as in the community.
"Naming streets after Nazis is an obvious clear no. There are no excuses," wrote MPP Rima Berns-McGown (Beaches-East York).
At a news conference before the review vote was announced, Horwath maintained the party has a thorough candidate vetting process in place for the spring election.
She acknowledged not acting quickly enough on two 2018 candidates that caused the party trouble on the campaign trail - one who railed against wearing poppies on Remembrance Day as "a ritual of war glorification" and another accused of posting Nazi memes on Facebook.
Neither candidate was dropped and Horwath said a more thorough review should have been conducted.

Full text: The ousting of leader Erin O'Toole this week was not a referendum on his performance, but rather symptomatic of larger fractures in the Conservative party.
A coalition that was founded to work in spite of - or even because of - regional and ideological tensions now appears incapable of agreeing upon a coherent set of principles for Conservative partisans, let alone Canadians more broadly.
O'Toole, the latest casualty of these tensions, was right to try and modernize the party, with policies characterized by inclusive social policy, a serious stance on climate change and a principled conservative vision for Canadian workers. However, his flailing efforts to appease competing factions created confusion for members, disappointment for voters and inconsistency for Conservative candidates.
As unfashionable as it might be in some circles, I continue to be a proud progressive conservative, and as a result am nothing but distressed with the party's current positioning. While there were glaring flaws in O'Toole's execution, his exit should be seen for what it is - a sign that the party has work to do to engage its members and to offer an approach to governing which could appeal to the vast majority of Canadians - rather than what it is not: some providential affirmation of vague social conservatism.
The task facing the Conservative party is not to ignore its history in a misguided attempt to turn itself into the political equivalent of a pretzel.
Far from it. As Tories, we need to embrace our history, seriously consider what Canadian progressive conservatism means today, and find our backbone in the process.
Of course, we can expect the process to be a messy one.
A vocal minority within the party has generated intense media fascination, won excessive influence and kneecapped creditable efforts to reconsider the party's stance on important issues.
The push-and-pull dynamics between populists and institutionalists, westerners and central Canadians, and social conservatives and progressives are not new. However, the rapid shift in the Canadian political centre, hastened by the pandemic, has laid those tensions bare.
The Conservative party's inability or unwillingness to adequately respond can largely be attributed to its relative success in avoiding electoral catastrophe.
The Liberals, on the other hand, were shocked into change after a series of embarrassing electoral losses to the Harper Conservatives. Their worst-ever result in 2011 - including relegation to third-party status - allowed Justin Trudeau to lead the party to a remarkable renaissance by unapologetically embracing social liberalism, exiling members of the old guard and setting his sights on a younger, more progressive coalition of voters. The result? He was propelled to victory in 2015.
It turns out that a brush with annihilation is a powerful source of courage. If only our party could be so lucky.
Meagre losses have failed to give us that overwhelming mandate for reform.
Quite frankly, many have become content with being the first runner-up - really the first loser - and taking painkillers to mask afflictions that actually require more complicated surgery. Rather, continued attempts to maintain an existing but declining base have meant the party has repeatedly failed to take the bold steps required in establishing a broader base that can actually win an election.
Canada needs strong voices who can address its growing affordability crisis and articulate a coherent foreign policy. Voices who can promote economic dynamism that propels young Canadians to enjoy the same opportunities as their parents, or (imagine) even better ones.
I hope that the soon-to-be-announced leadership race is defined by honest conversations about the Conservative coalition, and an acknowledgment that the loudest voices in the room or on social media are sometimes only that.
Maybe, if we are lucky, we will get a new leader who will finally challenge Conservatives to pursue a true north star - one of genuine, admirable and inclusive Canadian conservatism.

Full text: Trudeau should channel father's famous quip
"Just watch me" is burned into the memory of all of us who were alive to hear then prime minister Pierre Trudeau speak it, all those years ago.
It is time for his son, Justin, to do the same with the protesters in Ottawa.
They have a right to protest reasonably, but the point of reason has now passed. Move them out and return the civil social order that by far the vast majority of Canadian citizens support and deserve.
Peace, order and good government is certainly all the justification needed to take the necessary steps to do so.
Roger Hilderley, Stratford, Ont.
Canada is simply worn down by COVID-19
Canada has all the usual symptoms of what can be termed a national virus, including high fever, headaches, fatigue, shortness of breath and just plain feeling sick.
Turns out this late-stage nation-state COVID virus did not come from bats, a market or a lab. Rather, it gestated from fatigue over on-and-off-again lockdowns, government mandated vax passports, vaccination fears, school closures, job loss, job insecurity, working from home, runaway housing costs, inflation, wealth disparity, supply chain issues, social isolation, the shutdown of recreational and cultural venues, media hype, poor political leadership, as well as identity politics and culture wars.
Our immune systems are worn down. And a freezing January and a truckers' convoy long on frustration and anger but short on objectives and strategy don't help either.
Robert Anderson, Waterloo
No mandates? Then what's your solution?
Fighting for liberty means more than saying you disagree. You also need to provide a better way forward.
COVID-19 is real. It's constantly changing, and dealing with it is frustrating. COVID-19 hasn't gone away, and getting rid of mandates will not change that fact. Saying otherwise is wishful thinking.
Masks are uncomfortable. Injections are unpleasant. Vaccination side effects are real but limited. Closing optional social activities saved lives during the influenza epidemic in 1918, and again now; these interventions save lives.
To those opposing public health mandates, what are our other viable options?
I will start: mandating ventilation purification systems to include UV -C filtration in public spaces, especially in public transportation, airlines, buses and trains, with government funding to help so our businesses and recreational areas can stay open and stay safe.
Daniel Miller, M.D., Lethbridge, Alta.
Give the school experience kids need and deserve
My eight-year-old daughter tells me she doesn't want to go to school. She's fully vaccinated and has worn a mask to school every day the past two years. Well, when schools were open.
But her classroom is cold, she says, because they have to leave a window open all day, so the kids hunker down at their desks in their jackets. Since you have to take off your mask to eat, no one is allowed to talk or get up during lunch. There's no group work of any kind, no hands-on activities, no field trips. She wanted to bring a snow toy to school after the recent snowfall, but even that has been banned - no toys allowed.
Just because kids are "back in school" does not mean school is even close to the experience it was before the pandemic. Instead, it's a become a cold, fearful place that many kids dread, some choosing the even poorer virtual option.
Time and again, Doug Ford has said "schools should be the last thing to close and the first thing to open" and time and again he has failed them.
It's time to make things right and give our children the school experience they desperately need and deserve.
Ken Young, Markham
Tories faces monumental task choosing leader
For the Conservatives, firing Erin O'Toole is an opportunity, not a crisis, Feb. 3
In Althia Raj's column, she very clearly explains the issues the Conservative party has as they determine a new party leader and that it is crucial for all of us that they select one who demonstrates the values that represents their party's views, but also reflect those principles that we, as Canadians, hold so very dearly.
A leader who does not, may in fact lose the next election, but more importantly may sow discourse which will further impact on our country. The negativity that may develop could easily encourage those on the fringes of our society and breed an undercurrent of negative discourse that divides people.
We are, hopefully, coming out of a pandemic, one that has truly tested all of us in so many ways and we all need a Conservative party who holds true to its values but does not capitalize on what we have been through to try to advance their political capital.
Lynda Hurley, Toronto
China has Canada in its economic grasp
"What China wants, China gets," Opinion, Feb. 4
Our federal government is very likely being heavily pressured by Canada's powerful telecom giants to say "Yes" to China's Huawei, because they have already largely built its 5G tech into their systems.
Powerful business interests can debilitate our high-level elected officials through implicit or explicit threats to transfer or eliminate jobs and capital investment, thus economic stability, if corporate "requests" aren't accommodated.
It's a political crippling that's worsened by a blaring news media that's permitted to be naturally critical of incumbent governments, especially in regards to job and capital transfers and economic weakening.

Full text: OTTAWA - Interim Conservative Leader Candice Bergen shoved aside some key allies of former leader Erin O'Toole on Friday as the party began to reshape its short- and long-term future.
Bergen replaced four O'Toole supporters on what's known as the leadership team - MPs tasked with the day-to-day operations in Parliament - and also issued a statement seeking to moderate the party's position on the ongoing protest against COVID-19 vaccination mandates that has paralyzed downtown Ottawa for days.
Sources told the Star Bergen was getting pressure on all sides to dial back the party's support of the protesters' call for an end to vaccination mandates.
Tensions in Ottawa were running high at the prospect of another massive weekend protest and among Tories, concerns are also mounting that identifying too closely with the demonstrators could do long-term political damage at a time when the party needs to start rebuilding.
With that process furiously underway, Conservative insiders were abuzz Friday with speculation about whether Ottawa MP Pierre Poilievre would run for the party leadership.
The pugilistic finance critic mulled a run in the last leadership race, only to bow out at the eleventh hour. Since then, his star has only risen. Poilievre is in demand as a fundraiser and speaker on the conservative circuit, and while he may mock Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's selfies, he can hardly move through a crowd without being asked to take them himself.
O'Toole's decision to briefly remove Poilievre from the finance portfolio was among the grievances cited by Conservative MPs when they voted to oust O'Toole in a 73-45 vote.
In the waning hours of his leadership, O'Toole's allies were also invoking Poilievre's name and the fact he may not decide to run as a reason to continue to back O'Toole.
On Friday, Conservatives described him as a "juggernaut" - a force which crushes everything in its path - amid questions about what his entry might mean to the party's looming leadership race.
The party has twice debated how to run a leadership contest since Stephen Harper stepped down after losing the 2015 election.
In 2017, contenders were given months to submit an entry fee of $100,000 and gather the support of 300 party members in 30 electoral districts from across the country. The relatively low bar was later cited as the reason there were as many as 14 people in the race.
When one of those who stepped forward was TV personality and celebrity businessman Kevin O'Leary - who had never before taken an active role in federal politics - there was much hand-wringing about an "outsider" moving into the big blue tent. O'Leary ultimately bowed out when it became clear that his lack of ability to speak French would be more of a barrier than he'd realized.
When it came time to set the rules for the next contest, organizers decided to up the ante - the entry fee was set at $300,000, 3,000 signatures were needed and candidates only had a matter of weeks to get that all together.
In part perhaps because the COVID-19 pandemic hit just months after the race was called, only four people ultimately cleared the bar: rookie MP Derek Sloan, political newcomer Leslyn Lewis, O'Toole and former Progressive Conservative party leader Peter MacKay.
Almost 18 months later, MacKay has still not finished paying the bills he ran up in that contest; on Thursday, he held a fundraiser with businessman Conrad Black and Danielle Smith, the former leader of Alberta's populist Wildrose party.
That debt has fuelled speculation that MacKay might stay out of the next race, although a few blue hearts were set aflutter when the Toronto Sun published a column Friday in which he called for a strong Conservative party.
Given Poilievre's fundraising heft and wide network of support, he'd have no trouble qualifying for the race, insiders say.
But the choice for the organizing committee this time is how wide it wants the field to be - and that field could also be shaped by what Poilievre decides to do, numerous Conservatives say.
"Do people stay out because he's in? That's the question," one longtime party organizer told the Star.
On Friday, the party announced the first organizational steps for the race - a committee that will name the actual committee charged with setting the rules.
When it comes to when the votes will be cast, many are urging a speedy approach, eyeing September as the right time to have a new leader in place.
As an MP, the date may matter less to Poilievre than to others considering the job. Even if he lost, he'd still have his seat.
A similar calculus exists for fellow MP Leslyn Lewis, who entered the 2020 leadership contest as a total newcomer but ended up in a strong third-place finish thanks to rock solid support among the social conservative wing of the party. She's widely expected to run again.
Anyone coming in from the private sector could go back to their old jobs, too.
Names in the mix include Mark Mulroney, former Quebec premier Jean Charest, and Quebec business mogul Vincenzo Guzzo.
Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown, a former MP and former leader of Ontario's Progressive Conservatives, is already making calls to test the waters. He's up for re-election this fall, so he will need to assess the risks of seeking the federal leadership - and what happens if he doesn't win.
Brown's name began surfacing as a potential successor even before O'Toole got the boot, when he decided to champion a fight against Quebec's Bill 21, which prohibits people in positions of public authority from wearing religious symbols on the job.
The law gained renewed attention late last year after a teacher in Quebec who wears a hijab was removed from the classroom.
O'Toole's position on the bill was too mild for some in his caucus, and some had been prepared to force the issue internally before he was fired.
Many told the Star they expect it to be on the table in the next leadership race.
"This is something that as Conservatives we should have been fundamentally against from the get-go," said Kyle Seeback (Dufferin-Caledon).
"It's discriminatory. It's trampling religious freedom. And all we're asking is that our party take the position that as this went to the Supreme Court, we would intervene. I don't think that is a radical position. I think that is the right position."

Full text: With Erin O'Toole gone, the Canadian conservative movement finds itself at a fork in the road. But before choosing a path, Conservative party members will have to determine what destination they have in mind. As is often the case, the path of least resistance may well also be the most likely to lead to a dead end.
Here are a few early takes on the way forward:
There are those within the Conservative caucus who believe the road to success goes through a reconciliation with the People's Party or at least with its supporters.
Some MPs walked that talk this week when they went out of their way to cosy up with the ragtag mob that has been holding Canada's capital under siege.
Maxime Bernier's party may rank last or next to last in federal voting intentions, but it comes first in the hearts of a sizable number of the convoy's hard-core supporters.
In his early days as Canadian Alliance leader, Stephen Harper started off by bringing back to his caucus the handful of MPs who had bolted to the Tories in protest over Stockwell Day's leadership.
The two feuding federal conservative clans subsequently came to terms. The reunification of the Canadian right under a single federal roof was an essential step on the way to forming a Conservative government.
But Harper's overtures to the Tories were never only about putting an end to vote splitting. The move went beyond electoral mathematics. It also served to dispel the widespread notion that the Reform/Alliance party was too extreme to be considered a valid contender for government.
The merger of the Canadian Alliance with the Tories allowed Harper's party to project a more centrist image and, in the process, attract a critical number of mainstream voters to the blue tent.
A move toward the People's Party and its supporters would have the opposite effect. It would risk taking the Conservatives even further in the wilderness by making it a less palatable to the moderate voters it needs to win a governing mandate. Some of the voters who would be alienated by such a rapprochement are current Conservative sympathizers.
Among those who were celebrating O'Toole's demise, there were many who said they wanted to claim their party back.
As it happens, some of the New Democrats who showed Thomas Mulcair the door a few years ago harboured similar feelings. They believed their party had strayed from its roots under Mulcair to become more centrist. They said their top-of-mind goal was to reconnect with those roots.
Six years and two elections later, how well has that worked out?
There is little doubt many New Democrat activists are more comfortable with their party under Jagmeet Singh.
But the NDP has also gone from serious contender for federal power - with significant representation from every region of the country - to fourth place in the House of Commons and less than a handful of MPs east of Ontario.
As for the moral victories that have sustained the federal NDP for most of its existence, they have been few and far between over the past half-dozen years.
If O'Toole's tenure is going to be remembered for anything, it will be his attempt to drag the Conservative party into the climate-change tent. His acceptance of carbon pricing as an essential tool in any serious climate policy amounted to a timid but essential step toward that objective.
There is undoubtedly a constituency within the Conservative ranks that wants to walk back that step on the way to a change at the top. Last spring, more than half of the party's convention delegates would not support a resolution that acknowledged the seriousness of the climate crisis. But anyone who believes such a choice will expand rather than shrink the pool of available Conservative supporters has not kept touch with a fast-evolving public opinion.
In contrast with the NDP, the Conservative party has been left a vacuum to fill by Justin Trudeau's Liberals.
If there is a sweet spot for the party to land in, it is at centre-right, where Red Tories but also scores of Blue Liberals are quietly uncomfortable with the economic direction or lack thereof of the Trudeau government.
Those voters crave a competent, fiscally conservative alternative that is more interested in policy heavy-lifting than in glib, misleading social media hits.
Whether a candidate will materialize to succeed O'Toole who fits that bill is not a given. Nor is it certain that the party's many factions will manage to look beyond their pet causes on the way to selecting their next leader.
But as they ponder their options, the Conservatives might want to consider, a) that they won't necessarily have Trudeau to kick around in the next election, and b) that his successor could well bring more impressive economic credentials to the fore than the current prime minister.

All eyes are on Poilievre ahead of race: Party insiders abuzz about whether 'juggernaut' Ottawa MP would want to replace O'Toole

Full text: Interim Conservative Leader Candice Bergen shoved aside some key allies of former leader Erin O'Toole on Friday as the party began to reshape its short- and long-term future.
Bergen replaced four O'Toole supporters on what's known as the leadership team - MPs tasked with the day-to-day operations in Parliament - and also issued a statement seeking to moderate the party's position on the ongoing protest against COVID-19 vaccination mandates that has paralyzed downtown Ottawa for days.
Sources told the Star that Bergen was getting pressure on all sides to dial back the party's support of the protesters' call for an end to vaccination mandates.
Tensions in Ottawa were running high at the prospect of another massive weekend protest and among Tories, concerns are also mounting that identifying too closely with the demonstrators could do long-term political damage at a time when the party needs to start rebuilding.
With that process furiously underway, Conservative insiders were abuzz Friday with speculation about whether Ottawa MP Pierre Poilievre would run for the party leadership.
The pugilistic finance critic mulled a run in the last leadership race, only to bow out at the eleventh hour.
Since then, his star has only risen. Poilievre is in demand as a fundraiser and speaker on the conservative circuit, and while he may mock Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's selfies, he can hardly move through a crowd without being asked to take them himself.
O'Toole's decision to briefly remove Poilievre from the finance portfolio was among the grievances cited by Conservative MPs when they voted to oust O'Toole in a 73-45 vote.
In the waning hours of his leadership, O'Toole's allies were also invoking Poilievre's name and the fact he may not decide to run as a reason to continue to back O'Toole.
On Friday, Conservatives described him as a "juggernaut" - a force that crushes everything in its path - amid questions about what his entry might mean to the party's looming leadership race.
The party has twice debated how to run a leadership contest since Stephen Harper stepped down after losing the 2015 election.
In 2017, contenders were given months to submit an entry fee of $100,000 and gather the support of 300 party members in 30 electoral districts from across the country. The relatively low bar was later cited as the reason there were as many as 14 people in the race.
When one of those who stepped forward was TV personality and celebrity businessman Kevin O'Leary - who had never before taken an active role in federal politics - there was much hand-wringing about an "outsider" moving into the big blue tent. O'Leary ultimately bowed out when it became clear that his lack of ability to speak French would be more of a barrier than he'd realized.
When it came time to set the rules for the next contest, organizers decided to up the ante - the entry fee was set at $300,000, 3,000 signatures were needed and candidates only had a matter of weeks to get that all together.
In part perhaps because the COVID-19 pandemic hit just months after the race was called, only four people ultimately cleared the bar: rookie MP Derek Sloan, political newcomer Leslyn Lewis, O'Toole and former Progressive Conservative party leader Peter MacKay.
Almost 18 months later, MacKay has still not finished paying the bills he ran up in that contest; on Thursday, he held a fundraiser with businessman Conrad Black and Danielle Smith, the former leader of Alberta's populist Wildrose party.
That debt has fuelled speculation that MacKay might stay out of the next race, although a few blue hearts were set aflutter when the Toronto Sun published a column Friday in which he called for a strong Conservative party.
Given Poilievre's fundraising heft and wide network of support, he'd have no trouble qualifying for the race, insiders say.
But the choice for the organizing committee this time is how wide it wants the field to be - and that field could also be shaped by what Poilievre decides to do, numerous Conservatives say.
"Do people stay out because he's in? That's the question," one longtime party organizer told the Star.
On Friday, the party announced the first organizational steps for the race - a committee that will name the actual committee charged with setting the rules.
When it comes to when the votes will be cast, many are urging a speedy approach, eyeing September as the right time to have a new leader in place.
As an MP, the date may matter less to Poilievre than to others considering the job. Even if he lost, he'd still have his seat.
A similar calculus exists for fellow MP Leslyn Lewis, who entered the 2020 leadership contest as a total newcomer but ended up in a strong third-place finish thanks to rock solid support among the social conservative wing of the party. She's widely expected to run again.
Anyone coming in from the private sector could go back to their old jobs too.
Names in the mix include Mark Mulroney, former Quebec premier Jean Charest, and Quebec business mogul Vincenzo Guzzo.
Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown, a former MP and former leader of Ontario's Progressive Conservatives, is already making calls to test the waters. He's up for re-election this fall, so he will need to assess the risks of seeking the federal leadership - and what happens if he doesn't win.

1. Mississauga councillor resigned after a fellow councillor allegedly vandalized her SUV in the city hall parking garage
When Karen Ras resigned her seat from Mississauga’s city council, she thanked her family, colleagues and voters, but said little about why she was leaving before her term was up.
A farewell letter she posted online in mid-January referenced “workplace issues” faced by Mississauga councillors that she says aren’t effectively handled by the city’s code of conduct for politicians.
What Ras did not say at the time, was that for much of this term her vehicle had been repeatedly vandalized in the city parking garage.
And, she alleges to Torstar, it was another councillor who did it — Ron Starr, who has served on council for more than a decade.
2. The inside story of the plot to topple Erin O’Toole: ‘It’s about character’
For some Conservatives, it became clear more than a year ago that Erin O’Toole wasn’t going to survive as leader of their party.
O’Toole himself didn’t realize it until hours before he was ousted.
In that chasm between O’Toole and many members of his party — and the breakdown of good will and communication that created it — lie the reasons that 73 of 119 Conservative MPs voted on Wednesday to kick him out.
Some say it was O’Toole’s flip-flops that did him in, others his attempt to move the party to the centre. Some say it was his stance on conversion therapy, others his failure to consult and communicate. Some say his leadership was a casualty of the pandemic.
3. This family spent a lifetime perfecting self-isolation. They still caught COVID-19
The Vanstone family has spent a lifetime perfecting self-isolation, but when COVID-19 infiltrated their Simcoe County home, the entire household got sick.
Since Madison Vanstone’s cystic fibrosis diagnosis 20 years ago, her family has never had a virus sweep through the entire home the way COVID-19 did. Cystic fibrosis is a chronic disease that affects the lungs and other organs. The common cold or flu could wreak havoc on her body.
“We’ve lived with this scenario and this worry forever. However, [this] one just seemed to be so contagious that despite our best efforts, it went through everybody,” said Beth Vanstone, 59, who fell ill along with her husband and two daughters.
4. Toronto scientists are trying to crack one of COVID’s biggest mysteries: Its impact on the brain
For Susie Goulding the term “brain fog” doesn’t begin to cover it.
That makes it seem like she’s missed her morning coffee.
But she compares the intense and often debilitating memory, focus and concentration issues she’s faced over the past nearly two years to living with dementia.
“It’s completely flipped my life upside down,” said the 54-year-old Oakville resident.
5. The ‘Meh’ Decade: Slouchy flannel, shows about nothing, pre-internet bliss. The ’90s we romanticize — and the one we forget
When I was growing up in the ’80s and ’90s, my hometown of Lethbridge, Alberta, was not especially notable for its cultural abundance. Yet in a single year, when I happened to be in grade 12, I saw the following at our local multiplex: “Being John Malkovich,” “Eyes Wide Shut,” “Magnolia,” “Fight Club,” “Bringing Out the Dead,” “The Matrix,” “Boys Don’t Cry,” “The Thin Red Line ,” “Notting Hill,” “The Blair Witch Project,” “Election,” “Princess Mononoke,” “The Insider,” “Cider House Rules,” and “The Sixth Sense.” It did not occur to us, in 1999, that this was an unusually rich crop of movies—nor did it seem weird that you would experience cinematic landmarks by Stanley Kubrick, Terrence Malick and David Fincher down the hall from Suzy Shier, Randy River, and Orange Julius.
Cinephiles everywhere remember 1999 as a banner year at the movies. Even the teen crap of that year—“American Pie,” “Cruel Intentions,” “10 Things I Hate About You”—was somehow genre-defining teen crap. As awards season ramped up, it became clear that one film was rising above the competitive field. “American Beauty” topped many “best of” lists, nabbing Oscars for Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor, and Best Picture. As “Variety” put it at the time, “no other 1999 movie has benefited from such universal raves.”
Today, as Chuck Klosterman observes in “The Nineties: A Book,” “American Beauty” is widely considered not only bad, but also odious and morally reprehensible. In 1999, Roger Ebert had praised “American Beauty” for its poignant portrayal of “a man who is unloved by his wife, not respected by his daughter, and not needed at work,” which is exactly why (qua Klosterman) we now hate the film: “It examines the interior problems of upper-middle-class white people living in the late twentieth century…it was, in all probability, the last time in history such problems would be considered worthy of contemplation.”
6. Why the ‘Freedom convoy’ protest on Parliament Hill may just be the beginning
For days, the roads surrounding Parliament Hill have been choked, and the air of the nation’s capital has been thick with the incessant honking of truck horns.
As protesters continued to rally, a question hung in the air above the din.
What happens when all the trucks leave?
Initially, this was a protest against vaccine mandates for truckers crossing the Canada-U.S. border. But, as drivers from both coasts converged on Ottawa, the scope of their complaints has broadened. Now protesters have called for the elimination of all vaccine mandates, the removal of COVID-19-prevention restrictions and, at least according to a memorandum of understanding circulated by one organizer, the dissolution of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government.
None of those things are likely to happen, most agree. But if nothing else, the convoy has succeeded in organizing and mobilizing a large number of people. And that means the movement likely will not end once the trucks pull out of the nation’s capital.
7. How Canada’s ‘Freedom Convoy’ is inspiring protests in other countries
An anti-vaccine-mandate protest that began with Canadian truckers and their supporters travelling to Ottawa in a convoy may be forming the template for an international populist movement against COVID-19 restrictions.
As protesters in Ottawa were promising they wouldn’t put an end to their nearly weeklong occupation, as some have called it, of the capital until all COVID-19 restrictions are lifted, organizers in other countries were using the Canadian example to advance their own campaigns.
Dozens of Facebook and Telegram groups inspired by the Canadian truckers have sprouted up across the world, from Cyprus to Argentina to New Zealand, with members expressing solidarity and shared frustration, and in some cases, even organizing convoys to their own local capitals.
8. Rubens Mukja was gone for 42 days before his family found his body. Police returned a copy of his suicide note with a breakfast order on the back
On a Saturday night in early October, Rubens Mukja, 33, walked out of the Mississauga home he shared with his parents and never came back.
For more than a month, the software developer’s whereabouts were unknown, but his family feared the worst. He’d left a suicide note in his bedroom and, alarmingly, the gun owner appeared to have left with several of his handguns he’d removed from his safe, his family said.
Although Peel Regional Police initially launched an extensive missing persons probe that drew media coverage, the weeks dragged on with no news until, the family says, they were told that searching would cease unless new information came to light — and that Rubens didn’t want to be found .
Adding to their pain, the family say they were devastated when police returned to them a copy of Rubens’ note, with food orders scrawled on the back — handwritten notes for donuts and breakfast sandwiches — raising concerns about the officers’ credibility, said Eros Mukja, Rubens’ older brother.
9. This Toronto gym owner got $250,000 in aid and says he needs more. But are subsidies just keeping ‘zombie’ businesses alive?
Two weeks ago, Hugo Croft-Levesque was staring down imminent bankruptcy for his once-thriving Toronto kick-boxing gyms.
Even with $250,000 in government subsidies since COVID-19 restrictions began crushing his business, Croft-Levesque was more than $80,000 in debt.
For the first time since the pandemic began, he couldn’t pay rent.
On the verge of collapse, he managed to buy himself more time — his landlords agreed to wait until the next round of subsidies hit his bank account.
Just how much time he’s got, it’s not clear, with federal programs designed to give businesses a fighting chance during waves of lockdowns and restrictions set to phase out in the coming months.
10. I am Toufah: The Toronto woman who stood up to a dictator and launched a West African MeToo movement
Toufah Jallow lives in two worlds that are about to collide. In the North Toronto neighbourhood she has come to call home, she is an anonymous college student, “a simple girl,” she said, “trying to go to school and take the TTC.” But in The Gambia, the small West African nation she used to call home, “simple” is a distant memory. There she is a well-known activist and former beauty pageant winner who accused a dictator of rape. She is not simply a face of the nation’s “Me Too” movement. She bears its name, writes Star columnist Emma Teitel.
“#I am Toufah” is the hashtag that flooded Gambian social media amid Jallow’s heart-rending revelation at a televised press conference, and her subsequent testimony before the country’s Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission (TRRC) in 2019. Just four years earlier, at age 18, she had entered and won the Gambian version of America’s Got Talent, a state-sponsored televised beauty pageant. That distinction gained her the attention of a country and a personal audience with its president.
Later she would find herself detailing to the TRRC her charge of what happened next: in 2015, shortly after she was named pageant victor, she told them, Yahya Jammeh, the country’s then-president of more than 20 years, proposed marriage to her and then, when spurned, brutally raped her.
11. ‘Even in your death, they squeeze you out’: How cemeteries have also become out-of-reach Toronto real estate
At a cemetery in Oshawa, on a recent afternoon, a handful of people stood vigil as a woman in her early 30s was lowered into a grave — an hour’s drive away from her funeral in Toronto.
Toronto had been the young woman’s home for years, said Zoë Dodd, one of the few mourners gathered around the burial plot. She had family and friends in the city. But with social services covering her funeral costs — an arrangement available if someone dies in the city without enough money in their estate to cover basic end-of-life rituals — her final resting place was relegated to another city. They just couldn’t find a place to bury her in Toronto.
“The city squeezes out poor and working-class people,” Dodd said, noting that many of the woman’s friends couldn’t make the burial service in time — without cars, they’d be left relying on long transit commutes. “Then, even in your death, they squeeze you out to somewhere else.”
12. A drunk driver killed her children. Now she wants Ottawa to strengthen victims’ rights
Canada’s criminal justice system does little to help victims of crime despite the existence of a national victims’ bill of rights, says Jennifer Neville-Lake, whose three children were killed by a drunk driver.
She’s now pushing for Parliament to strengthen those rights.
It’s an “incredibly traumatic experience” to be a victim in the criminal justice system, Neville-Lake said in a recent interview with the Star. “You’re just carried along, you’re just there.”
All of Neville-Lake’s children, Daniel, 9, Harrison, 5, and Milagros (Milly), 2, along with her father, 65-year-old Gary Neville, were killed by drunk driver Marco Muzzo in 2015 in Vaughan, Ont., a case that shocked the country.
13. ‘How long can we keep doing this?’ CFIB president Dan Kelly on mental health, butting heads with Doug Ford, and wooing customers back during the Omicron wave
Dan Kelly is everywhere.
Between the first day of the COVID-19 pandemic nearly two years ago and late January, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business president estimates the CFIB has fielded 3,000 media interviews. He cranks out Twitter quips, talks with business reporters on live TV and appears in national newspapers (including this one). Over the holidays, he even took calls with Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland about the plight of the CFIB’s 110,000 or so members.
“I hate business subsidies,” Kelly remarks. “Nobody will be happier than me to see all of these subsidy programs eliminated.”
And yet, for the last two years the CFIB have pleaded with Ottawa to keep billions in relief money flowing to small business owners facing flatlining revenue and hiring woes.

Cosying up to Maxime Bernier would seal the Conservatives' fate as a fringe party

Full text: MONTREAL — With Erin O’Toole gone, the Canadian conservative movement finds itself at a fork in the road. But before choosing a path, Conservative party members will have to determine what destination they have in mind. As is often the case, the path of least resistance may well also be the most likely to lead to a dead end.
Here are a few early takes on the way forward:

- There are those within the Conservative caucus who believe the road to success goes through a reconciliation with the People’s Party or at least with its supporters.


Some MPs walked that talk this week when they went out of their way to cosy up with the ragtag mob that has been holding Canada’s capital under siege.
Maxime Bernier’s party may rank last or next to last in federal voting intentions, but it comes first in the hearts of a sizable number of the convoy’s hard-core supporters.
In his early days as Canadian Alliance leader, Stephen Harper started off by bringing back to his caucus the handful of MPs who had bolted to the Tories in protest over Stockwell Day’s leadership.
The two feuding federal conservative clans subsequently came to terms. The reunification of the Canadian right under a single federal roof was an essential step on the way to forming a Conservative government.
But Harper’s overtures to the Tories were never only about putting an end to vote splitting. The move went beyond electoral mathematics. It also served to dispel the widespread notion that the Reform/Alliance party was too extreme to be considered a valid contender for government.
The merger of the Canadian Alliance with the Tories allowed Harper’s party to project a more centrist image and, in the process, attract a critical number of mainstream voters to the blue tent.
A move toward the People’s Party and its supporters would have the opposite effect. It would risk taking the Conservatives even further in the wilderness by making it a less palatable to the moderate voters it needs to win a governing mandate. Some of the voters who would be alienated by such a rapprochement are current Conservative sympathizers.

- Among those who were celebrating O’Toole’s demise, there were many who said they wanted to claim their party back.


As it happens, some of the New Democrats who showed Thomas Mulcair the door a few years ago harboured similar feelings. They believed their party had strayed from its roots under Mulcair to become more centrist. They said their top-of-mind goal was to reconnect with those roots.
Six years and two elections later, how well has that worked out?
There is little doubt many New Democrat activists are more comfortable with their party under Jagmeet Singh.
But the NDP has also gone from serious contender for federal power — with significant representation from every region of the country — to fourth place in the House of Commons and less than a handful of MPs east of Ontario.
As for the moral victories that have sustained the federal NDP for most of its existence, they have been few and far between over the past half-dozen years.

- If O’Toole’s tenure is going to be remembered for anything, it will be his attempt to drag the Conservative party into the climate-change tent. His acceptance of carbon pricing as an essential tool in any serious climate policy amounted to a timid but essential step toward that objective.


There is undoubtedly a constituency within the Conservative ranks that wants to walk back that step on the way to a change at the top. Last spring, more than half of the party’s convention delegates would not support a resolution that acknowledged the seriousness of the climate crisis. But anyone who believes such a choice will expand rather than shrink the pool of available Conservative supporters has not kept touch with a fast-evolving public opinion.
In contrast with the NDP, the Conservative party has been left a vacuum to fill by Justin Trudeau’s Liberals.
If there is a sweet spot for the party to land in, it is at centre-right, where Red Tories but also scores of Blue Liberals are quietly uncomfortable with the economic direction or lack thereof of the Trudeau government.
Those voters crave a competent, fiscally conservative alternative that is more interested in policy heavy-lifting than in glib, misleading social media hits.
Whether a candidate will materialize to succeed O’Toole who fits that bill is not a given. Nor is it certain that the party’s many factions will manage to look beyond their pet causes on the way to selecting their next leader.
But as they ponder their options, the Conservatives might want to consider, a) that they won’t necessarily have Trudeau to kick around in the next election, and b) that his successor could well bring more impressive economic credentials to the fore than the current prime minister.

Doug Ford accused of 'emboldening' protesters as Toronto braces for weekend rally

Full text: Denouncing the Ottawa protest by anti-vaxxers and anti-lockdown activists as “an occupation,” Premier Doug Ford is warning those rallying at Queen’s Park this weekend to behave themselves.
“Any harassment or acts of hatred or acts of violence, we’ll have zero tolerance, absolutely zero tolerance,” Ford told reporters at a Council of the Federation meeting of Canada’s premiers on Friday.
His comments came as downtown Toronto braced for a truckers’ protest similar to the one that has blockaded the area around Parliament Hill for the past week.
“It’s not a protest any more, it’s become an occupation. It’s only hurting families, it’s hurting businesses. It’s time for this to come to an end,” the premier said, chiding the Ottawa demonstrators.
“You think we like lockdowns or public health measures? We don’t. They were necessary.”
Ford stressed that pledged the province would help Toronto and its police force in any way possible.
Earlier, opposition leaders had accused him of sending the wrong signals to demonstrators by saying “God bless them” and sympathizing with their frustration in comments to a Hamilton radio station.
Last weekend, the Ottawa demonstration clogged downtown streets as some protesters waved Nazi and Confederate flags, harassed local residents, threw rocks at ambulances and honked air horns incessantly.
“To pretend that might not be exactly what’s on its way to Queen’s Park is being wilfully ignorant,” said New Democrat Leader Andrea Horwath, who expressed concern about the safety of people working at five hospitals near the legislature.
“His words are simply emboldening this crowd.”
Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca noted Ford has changed his tone about the so-called “Freedom Convoy” after calling previous COVID-19 demonstrators “a bunch of yahoos.”
Del Duca pointed out the premier said nothing about the deteriorating situation in the nation’s capital until Monday — three days after it began.
“Doug Ford has to a large extent been missing in action,” the Liberal leader told reporters, calling Ford’s public statements “weak” and “half-hearted.”
“I suspect, I fear, someone who is looking at the election that is coming up in a few months, perhaps contemplating a bid for the leadership of the federal Conservative party ... is now coddling that anti-vaxxer fringe, that extremist fringe that I’m sad to say we have on display in Ottawa,” Del Duca added.
“He is trying to cobble together a very dangerous coalition.”
Ford, who faces weekly demonstrations outside his Etobicoke home , told CHML in an interview Thursday that, “I just hope it’s always a peaceful protest.”
“We live in a democracy. If people want to come down and protest, God bless them. I understand their frustration,” he said.
On Friday afternoon, Toronto police began closing streets within several blocks of the legislature and five nearby teaching hospitals, redirecting snarled traffic and positioning police vehicles at nearby intersections.
The heavy police presence included drones being readied to provide aerial surveillance at Saturday’s protest.
Two tractors got to Queen’s Park before the roadblocks were in place. They were later escorted north by police to Avenue Road south of Bloor Street West, where about three dozen farm tractors, pickups and trucks had been blocked by a phalanx of police vehicles and two buses. The sound of their air horns filled the air.
One pickup truck had a large sign mounted in the back reading: “Give back our freedoms. Take off your mask and smell the bulls - - - of the mainstream media.”
Green Leader Mike Schreiner said the premier “needs to stop playing both sides when it comes to anti-vaccine protests.”
Solicitor General Sylvia Jones has said “peaceful protest is a cornerstone of a healthy democracy.”
“However, criminal behaviour is never tolerated, and hatred or intolerance must be condemned by all,” said Jones.
“The role of the police is to keep the peace and protect the public. The government does not interfere with or direct police operational decisions, including in response to occupations, demonstrations, or blockades,” she said.
“There are long-standing historical reasons for the separation between the government and policing operations. As with any major demonstration, local police will take the appropriate action to keep their communities safe, and we stand ready to provide additional support if necessary.”
But mindful of University Avenue’s hospital row, Jones warned that “blocking access to emergency medical services, including paramedic services and hospitals, is completely unacceptable.”

Full text: Look who’s coming to Toronto.
The fretful men living in their trucks in downtown Ottawa have a plan: to dissolve the federal government in favour of, basically, a committee of public safety comprising Gov.-Gen. Mary Simon, the Senate and whoever else the little men choose.
Their very exclusive group, Canada Unity, has 251 members, the size of a mid-budget wedding. Its “Citizens of Canada Committee” would then run Canada , instructing “all levels of the Federal, Provincial, Territorial, and Municipal governments to immediately cease and desist all unconstitutional human rights, discriminatory and segregated actions.” And if the Governor General et al. won’t do this, the federal government must fall.
It sounds awfully good actually — it’s what we’re always saying to governments we already have, especially about unplowed streets after snowstorms — but do go on.
This would be “an unprecedented dissolution of the federal system and put an abrupt end to 155 years of continuous parliamentary rule (a record that happens to rank us as one of the world’s oldest democracies),” wrote puzzled journalist Tristin Hopper , a funny, enjoyable writer, but no one else is laughing. (I am.)
“You go, girl(s). Down with the ‘aristocratic conspiracy,’” as they said in the ’90s. Sorry, that last bit was the 1790s. It was the French Revolution.
Back then, that version of a Committee of Public Safety — or Comité de salut public as they called it, being French — had nine men but ballooned to 12.
Despite constant onboarding and outcycling to avoid quarrels, the 12 quickly turned against each other and the resultant bloodbath was so dreadfully famous that you’d think the men of Ottawa would have heard about it.
They’ve heard about Nazis and they sure misinterpreted that. I wonder if they know about the sad history of central committeeship in China and the former Soviet Union.
They view Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as an aristocratic conspiracy of one and believe that they, beating heart of the common man, can whip Canada into shape. They want no rules about COVID-19 whatsoever, no masking, no vaccination mandates, and reinstatement of the canned unvaccinated, among other things.
And they want the locals to like them. Can we be friends?
No. Back away from the Toronto.
We already knew what they oppose. We now know what they support, which is repeatedly degrading the statue of Terry Fox, who ran across the country supporting cancer care, dancing on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, defecating and urinating in people’s snowy front yards, honking horns so people can’t sleep, running diesel engines so people fall ill from fumes, preventing public ceremonies honouring Muslim victims of terrorism, demanding food at homeless shelters, terrorizing local women, howling at masked hospice workers, hauling diesel in carts to feed their idling engines, building shacks, and shutting down businesses in downtown Ottawa.
Bad parking does not a revolution make.
At this point, they have not met the Governor General, nor will they. Do they think of her as mom? I suspect her tone would be icy. Go make your bed, as Jordan Peterson once put it.
I have decided not to call them “truckers,” given that 90 per cent of Canadian truckers are vaccinated, eager to work, and have nothing to do with these strange fringe types. Driving transport trucks is not an identity; being a jerk is.
They are extremist jerks; their stupidity makes them even more dangerous because they can be easily lied to, ordered about, and made to ruin their own lives and the lives of others.
This week I noticed a strange thing: large white maskless men on the Toronto subway, openly eating takeout. No one does that. Are they from out of town?
As a political statement, it’s not exactly Churchillian but still. Are lights going out all over the Prairies? Shall we not see them again in our lifetime? We will if the Toronto police get all grim about it, and I hope they do.
Lie down with jerks, wake up with fleas. GoFundMe found that out the hard way after allegations it took donations for the protest from abroad, and from people using fake names . The protest is un-Canadian.
And I’ve called them “little men” but they’re not. They dress like moonshiners, like paintballers, in the most unflattering parkas I’ve seen this winter. Collectively, they look like a batch of mashed potatoes demanding to run the country. It’s a cry for help.
So is everything right now. I too demand an end to “unconstitutional human rights, discriminatory and segregated actions” — not even grammatical — and the way the RCMP, the Ontario government and sullen city police failed to end an illegal occupation.
Ottawa police bullies allowed the downtown Morgentaler abortion clinic to be terrorized in the same way for many years. As a result, the province set up clinic safe zones .
This time it’s different. “If people want to come down and protest, God bless them,” Premier Doug Ford said about the demonstration coming to Toronto this weekend. In four months we will vote for a new premier. Ford should beware.

Full text: Since the Conservative caucus dumped Erin O’Toole as leader on Wednesday, some have suggested the party is now doomed — that its best chance for mainstream electability was thrown out the window, and that by courting its populist and social conservative flanks, the party relegates itself to a longer stint on the opposition benches. I believe this is too simplistic a read on what happened and ignores the opportunity ahead.
The move to show O’Toole the door was an overwhelming condemnation of O’Toole himself. As one caucus member put it to me Thursday, “He’s a hypocrite.” The vote was not a condemnation of the more centrist approach O’Toole espoused, it was a denunciation of his performance. Yes, social conservatives are upset with O’Toole. But he betrayed them by courting their support during the leadership race by pretending to be a candidate he had no plans to be.
Discussions about the Conservative party often focus on the challenge of having a large base of social conservatives. They are very influential, and they are organized. Activists dominate many riding associations. They stack delegate nomination meetings to ensure their own supporters vote at party conventions. They’re important volunteers who can either help elect candidates or mount challenges against sitting MPs during nomination battles. They are also an important donor base.
But they have not — yet —been the majority of the party.
If O’Toole ran his leadership campaign in 2020 on the platform he presented to Canadians during the 2021 election campaign — pro-choice, in favour of carbon pricing and a temporary ban on assault-style weapons —he would have run to the left of Peter MacKay, a pro-choice candidate, and lost.
O’Toole only became leader by being the second choice of supporters of Derek Sloan and Leslyn Lewis. With two pro-choice candidates, it’s safe to assume social conservatives would have left the rest of their preferential ballots blank.
The last time abortion was debated at a Conservative convention was in 2018. The motion, to delete a line in the policy book stating a Conservative government will not support any legislation to regulate abortion, was defeated by a vote of 53 per cent against. Tight, uncomfortably so, but still a defeat. In 2016, 70 per cent of Conservative delegates voted to strike the definition of marriage as a union between one man and one woman from the Tories’ policy book.
The message here is clear: the party belongs to those who show up. The fight for what becomes of the Conservative party will happen over the next several months. The next leader will set the tone, the policy priorities, and the parameters of the party’s coalition.
If those who are socially progressive and fiscally conservative sit out the fight, that coalition may be dominated by the social conservatives and far-right populists who some in the party now seem preoccupied in courting. So, find desirable candidates. Sell memberships. The formula is not complicated.
It took the Liberals two tries and a near-death experience after Paul Martin to land on Justin Trudeau. The Conservatives are not doomed. They just need to find someone willing to step up and do the work that’s required to build a party that reflects the country.
There should be a Conservative leader unafraid to denounce the truck convoy occupying Ottawa. Someone willing to say people have the right to peaceful assembly, but it doesn’t look like this. A leader who expresses alarm at the presence of Nazi and Confederate flags, and doesn’t just refer to the people waving them as “bad apples.”
It should also be possible to have a leader capable of empathy —one who says people who lose their jobs because they refuse to be vaccinated, for whatever reason, should have access to a job bank where employers don’t require vaccinations. That the country’s safety net includes all Canadians, not just those whose views we agree with.
(To be clear, I remain convinced that not getting vaccinated is a selfish position. The “freedom” signs lining the fence of the parliamentary precinct might as well say “Let more people die” or “Undermine health care.” But I also think many who refuse to get vaccinated are scared and misinformed, and I don’t think they should lose their houses or have their children go hungry.)
Some of the names currently being tossed around as potential Conservative leaders concern me. I hope the Tories don’t settle on a divisive leader who spreads misinformation convincingly.
Canada needs a broad-based party that can challenge the Liberals for power. Not only do the voters deserve choice, but this will help prevent the Grits from being lazy and ensure more accountable government.
It is in all our interests that the Tories pick well.

Full text: Mississauga councillor Ron Starr needs to resign and city officials — including Mayor Bonnie Crombie — must be held accountable for failing to support Karen Ras .
Crombie, who never shies from journalists, TV cameras or scrums, is suddenly unavailable for media interviews.
She seems to be taking a page from Premier Doug Ford’s playbook.
This comes following allegations of harassment and vandalism by Starr, which contributed to Ras’s abrupt resignation last month , to the dismay of her Ward 2 constituents.
Council met on Feb. 2, planning to discuss whether the next Ward 2 councillor will be appointed or elected in a byelection.
To no one’s surprise, council appointed a familiar face to fill in ahead of the Oct. 24 election: Pat Mullin.
She preceded Ras, and spent 29 years in office before retiring in 2014.
But a CBC News story released early that morning accused a sitting councillor of harassing and intimidating Ras — without initially naming him .
Throughout the day, details emerged and further investigation — including one by Torstar — identified Starr as the alleged vandal caught on camera keying Ras’s SUV in an underground parking garage at the civic centre in April 2021.
He’s now taking a leave of absence at the request of council.
There were eight documented cases of vandalism, violence and harassment in the workplace.
Ras contacted Peel Regional Police and complained to city hall security, leading to cameras being installed.
Criminal charges weren’t laid. Ras told Torstar the $1,250 repair bill was paid by Starr. How noble of him.
Reimbursement aside, this is hardly behaviour one would deem appropriate from a long-time city councillor. If Starr worked in the private sector, he’d already be fired.
The Municipal Act encompasses a code of conduct addressing respectful behaviour by council. Ras, however, has been shown nothing but disrespect.
Mayor Crombie’s silence and failure to demonstrate leadership during this debacle is damning. Meanwhile, the city’s corporate communications team is in full crisis-management mode.
“Neither council or the corporation of the City of Mississauga condone the alleged actions by one of our city councillors or any harassment or bullying at city facilities,” said Crombie via a news release issued after 5 p.m. on Feb. 2.
“We take seriously the safety of all our employees, members of council and everyone who visits the City Hall precinct. Through this investigation, we will get the answers council and the public demand and deserve.”
If that were true, Crombie would’ve immediately addressed this matter, long before it was exposed by the press. Where was the investigation when Ras needed it most?
Then, Crombie had the audacity to tweet about the latest developments after the news release went out, making sure to add Ras’s name: “In light of the serious allegations involving Councillor Ron Starr, @citymississauga Council voted unanimously today for our IC to open an investigation into the matter. Through this, we will get the answers that Karen Ras, the public and Council demand and deserve.”
So now integrity commissioner Robert Swayze can open an investigation, only after a flurry of explosive press coverage? Why wasn’t this brought before council months ago? And when will Swayze investigate Crombie’s inaction regarding this very serious matter?
Council’s code of conduct has to be amended — as soon as possible — to address harassment among colleagues.
In addition, councillors cannot be allowed to “police themselves,” as Ras succinctly put it.
Ras deserved answers and recourse months ago, and Crombie doesn’t get to spin this and act like she’s suddenly all for transparency.
This fiasco could signal the end of Crombie’s mayoral reign. Crombie cruised to victory in 2014 after being endorsed by former mayor Hazel McCallion, and has had an easy run — until now.
Ward 2 voters — home to the city’s wealthiest and most demanding taxpayers — and residents across Mississauga, including Starr’s Ward 6, are fuming and voicing their concerns on social media.
But tweeting and posting in local Facebook groups isn’t nearly enough action. They need to take their grievances — about Starr, Crombie and the council code of conduct — to the Office of the Ombudsman of Ontario.
“Anyone who has an unresolved administrative issue with a municipality is welcome to make a complaint to our office at www.ombudsman.on.ca ,” said spokesperson Linda Williamson in an email.
Finally, Crombie needs to stop hiding, and publicly apologize to Ras and the furious taxpayers who dutifully elected her — and watched Ras get kicked to the curb.

The inside story of the plot to topple Erin O'Toole: 'It's about character'

Full text: OTTAWA — For some Conservatives, it became clear more than a year ago that Erin O’Toole wasn’t going to survive as leader of their party.
O’Toole himself didn’t realize it until hours before he was ousted.
In that chasm between O’Toole and many members of his party — and the breakdown of good will and communication that created it — lie the reasons that 73 of 119 Conservative MPs voted on Wednesday to kick him out.
Some say it was O’Toole’s flip-flops that did him in, others his attempt to move the party to the centre. Some say it was his stance on conversion therapy, others his failure to consult and communicate. Some say his leadership was a casualty of the pandemic.
One common thread that emerged from interviews with Conservative MPs, party staffers, organizers and others with long-standing ties to the party was perhaps best encapsulated by rookie MP Stephen Ellis:
“Democracy is a messy, messy way to do work.”
O’Toole won leadership in August 2020, beating out the presumed front-runner Peter MacKay by appealing to the right wing of the party as a “true blue” Conservative and hoovering up support from social conservatives who felt alienated by MacKay’s progressive approach.
In his victory speech, he pledged a renewed conservative movement, one that welcomed more Canadians, and many party members nodded in agreement.
In the months following that speech, however, O’Toole sidelined supporters of his rivals in the leadership contest, going so far as to kick one rival — Derek Sloan — out of the Conservative caucus altogether.
Then in March 2021, he gave a speech to the party’s policy convention — and while some of its themes echoed his victory speech in August, his “true blue” credentials had already begun to fade in the eyes of the party’s membership.
In the August speech, the grassroots heard words of optimism and renewal; in March, they heard insults as O’Toole emphasized the need for the party to have courage, and to prove to voters that it had grown and learned.
“We could get onside with moving the party, but not with being told there was something wrong with us,” said one longtime MP.
“We’re a big tent party, we always have been. But he started creating camps in that tent with that speech.”
Next came carbon pricing. A month after the convention, without warning or briefing any of his MPs, O’Toole dropped a bombshell : the Tories were going to embrace the idea of putting a consumer price on carbon.
“Look, I hate carbon taxes,” one MP told the Star this week. “Maybe he never could have convinced me it was the right approach, but he didn’t even give us the dignity of being part of the conversation.”
At that moment, the bonds of trust between the leader and his party’s MPs began to break.
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic was also throwing up its own challenges.
The Conservative MPs elected in 2019 included many rookies who’d barely taken their seats in the House of Commons before the country closed its doors; another group followed in 2021, when pandemic restrictions remained.
Conservative MP Alex Ruff, a longtime O’Toole supporter, said the team-building necessary for new MPs under a new leader was impossible in the Zoom era.
In his view, what happened in the last week of O’Toole’s leadership was a reflection of the pandemic.
“This was about two years of being locked up, frustrated and without being able to come together in person as a team,” he said.
People close to O’Toole now acknowledge that he never had a good enough read on his MPs, often minimizing issues and problems or catching up with them too late.
At the point in last summer’s election campaign when the Conservatives were on track to potentially form a minority government, many figured that a victory would help soothe some of the ongoing tensions.
Except O’Toole didn’t win.
And even as he struck an optimistic tone in the days that followed, his supporters sensed that the beginning of the end could be upon them.
“It was one and done,” said a long-time Conservative organizer. “That was the precedent set for Andrew Scheer, and that’s what was going to happen to us.”
Nonetheless, his team thought they could make it to 2023, when O’Toole would face the leadership review required by the party’s constitution. With enough time, some felt they could still turn the ship around.
Deputizing defeated MP James Cumming to conduct a review of the campaign’s failings would give them time to present a plan and a path forward, O’Toole’s team believed. Maybe they could convince the caucus — and the party’s members — to give him another chance.
It seemed to help that many Conservatives believe in the right of the party’s grassroots to handle all matters of leadership.
That’s why, in their first meeting of the post-election era, the Conservative MPs were not unanimously in favour of adopting a provision of the Reform Act which gives a party’s MPs the power to call for a leadership review if 20 per cent of caucus wants one.
But the provision was adopted nonetheless. At the time, O’Toole said it was a not a “sword of Damocles” hanging over his head — but that was exactly what it became.
Getting 20 per cent of caucus to sign up took time but, in the end, not as much as even the organizers anticipated.
The irritants had piled up: A snap motion to push a bill banning conversion therapy all the way to the Senate; an apparent flip-flop over mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations on Parliament Hill; a leak of a damaging story about Alberta MP Shannon Stubbs, in what was perceived as retribution for her call for an earlier leadership review.
What his MPs saw as signs of disrespect were considered by O’Toole’s team to be the necessary work of bringing a restive group to heel.
Closing out 2021 was the “bloodbath” in a December caucus meeting over Quebec’s Bill 21, which prohibits those in positions of public authority from wearing religious symbols at work.
That meeting would set the course for the final days of O’Toole’s leadership.
A motion was put up for debate at the next meeting that would see the party condemn Bill 21 in no uncertain terms — even though the party’s official policy was that Quebec lawmakers had the right to do as they liked. O’Toole’s inner circle saw it as a trap. Adopting the motion would create a new fissure in caucus between its Quebec MPs and those opposed to Bill 21.
It seemed that the leaders detractors were not going to stop until they triggered a leadership review.
Internal pressure was brought to bear on O’Toole to consider what grassroots Tories had been asking for via several competing petitions, including one from Conservative Sen. Denise Batters: move up the leadership review.
Then, a week ago Monday, O’Toole gave what many considered a disjointed news conference about the imminent arrival of a trucker convoy in Ottawa. Few knew at the time that his wife Rebecca had just come through surgery, multiple sources told the Star, while O’Toole was juggling the return of Parliament, his restive caucus and the need for a thoughtful response to the demands of the protesters.
His response didn’t land well, and his team knew it. For the next four days, they would fight over how to deal with the convoy.
Videos were shot and shelved, lines argued over. In the meantime, some of his MPs were loudly and proudly backing the truckers.
A caucus retreat that same week turned into a shambles.
One MP took the microphone and gave O’Toole an intense and emotional dressing drown over his handling of COVID-19 vaccination requirements for MPs; when O’Toole suggested they continue the conversation elsewhere, the MP flat-out refused.
The second day of the meeting featured Cummings’s post mortem of the 2021 election campaign — but details from it were being leaked to the media even as O’Toole’s MPs were hearing them for the first time.
The renewed sense of being disrespected, and the fact there was no obvious plan for change in the campaign report, spurred meetings that night on how to gather enough signatures to force a vote on O’Toole’s leadership.
“A letter like this doesn’t come because of a single policy or an ideological divide,” said one MP.
“It’s about character.”
Both sides started making calls over the weekend.
By Monday, it was clear that enough signatures had been gathered to trigger the vote.
O’Toole’s team lashed out, portraying the organizers as acolytes of former leader Andrew Scheer, or members of “the conversion crew” who were still angry about the handling of the conversion therapy bill.
Later that night, O’Toole would issue a statement suggesting there were forces at work trying to drag the party down.
One long-time MP, who said they are in none of those camps, said it was O’Toole’s response that cemented his decision to vote him out.
“I had such high hopes for him as a leader,” the MP said, “but I’ve been left totally disappointed and disillusioned.”
Two MPs told the Star their colleagues lied to O’Toole when he called canvassing for their support, a move many framed as payback for the times they felt O’Toole had deceived them.
“Our support was soft,” said one O’Toole loyalist, “and we couldn’t harden it up.”
In his last-ditch pitch to caucus to keep him on, O’Toole pointed to the party’s gains and growth on his watch.
He promised to move up the leadership review and let the members have their say.
They will now, MPs say, whenever the next leadership race is called.
As for O’Toole, he insists there’s no bad seat in the House of Commons, and says he wants to stay as the MP for Durham.
“I pledge my support and unwavering loyalty to our next leader,” he said following his ouster, “and I urge everyone in our party to come together and do the same.”

Full text: Ultimately, the experiment has failed. The saga of Erin O’Toole has demonstrated the near impossibility of uniting the right behind one party. Conservatives who want to challenge Liberal hegemony will have to find another vehicle.
In theory, O’Toole did all the right things. He won the leadership of his party by presenting himself as a true-blue conservative.
Once that was in the bag, he moved quickly to the left in order to appeal to the electorate at large. He endorsed a carbon tax, and had his caucus withdraw its support for conversion therapy. He made a direct pitch to unionized workers. He stopped playing footsie with the Christian right.
In short, he followed the classic formula for Conservative success: Go right to get your party on side; veer left to appeal to the country as a whole.
His problem was that this time, the classic formula didn’t work.
It didn’t work because his caucus eventually refused to play along. Conservatives — and presumably the voters they represent — were sick of hiding their true beliefs just to score easy political points in official Ottawa.
The result was total confusion. O’Toole would articulate one position, while one or more of his caucus mates articulated another.
The contradictions grew particularly intense during last weekend’s trucker protest in Ottawa. Some Conservative MPs supported the protesters. Others, echoing the feelings of many non-Conservative Canadians, were less enthusiastic.
O’Toole himself appeared confused as to what he thought about the protest.
Indeed, O’Toole seemed confused about almost everything. He continued his efforts to appeal to a broad spectrum of Canadians. Yet he might reverse himself if those efforts appeared, in Conservative terms, to be too controversial.
None of this was supposed to work this way. When Stephen Harper’s Canadian Alliance joined forces with Peter MacKay’s Progressive Conservatives, the resultant Conservative Party of Canada was supposed to act as a single, unified party.
The new party, it was thought, would eliminate feuds within the right and eventually bring the Conservatives to power.
Under Harper, this is exactly what happened. The Conservatives won three straight victories. In 2015, they appeared to be settling in for more.
But the feuds didn’t end. They grew. Social conservatives were increasingly at odds with their secular counterparts. Riding associations fractured along ideological lines.
The reasons for this were unclear. In part, they had to do with Harper’s exit from the political scene. With him gone, there was no one to enforce discipline on the party.
But in part, the splits reflected the party’s failure to forge a single coherent vision. There are still two parties warring within the bosom of the unified Conservative movement.
As O’Toole put it this week, one of those parties is modern and moderate. The other is reactionary and extreme.
The moderate party had a chance at winning power, because on most issues it was in sync with the majority of Canadians. The extreme party had no chance because it was not.
This fatal contradiction cannot be wished away. Except for a brief period under Harper, attempts to unite the right have failed.
A new leader will not solve this problem. O’Toole was a perfectly normal leader; he couldn’t make it work. There is no reason to think anyone else could do better.
Perhaps it is time to admit that uniting the right has failed. Perhaps it is time to divide the Conservative party back into its constituent parts. Social conservatives can vote for one party, and fiscal conservatives can vote for another. Those who win seats can form coalitions with like-minded MPs.
It would take a while for conservatives elected under this system to win power. It takes a while already. Recognition that the right is not united would at least be more honest.

Full text: Yes Doug Ford is premier, but a province is not a nation.
Why not Ford Nation — prime minister of all Canada?
Ford has never given up his dream of winning the bigger “brass ring” on Parliament Hill. Those are the words he has used in private moments to describe the one big achievement that still eludes him today.
Now, with Wednesday’s defenestration of Erin O’Toole as federal Conservative leader, a window of opportunity has opened wider for that still-tempting brass ring. With the leadership up for grabs again, is Ford ready to act on his lingering political fantasy?
Surely there are many good reasons to discount this bad idea. But don’t count him out just yet, not until you’ve answered today’s question and tomorrow’s thought experiment:
Who is the most powerful of all Tories in Canada today?
When Ford repurposed himself as the populist premier of the most populous province in Canada, he was quickly regarded as a rock star among his fellow travellers. When he popped up at a federal Conservative convention in 2018, delegates relegated the party’s new national leader at the time, Andrew Scheer, to taking pictures of them with Ford.
Many other Ontario contenders and pretenders will be fielding phone calls today (more on that later). But all eyes are on the premier who will have his ear to the ground — and his cellphone — until the snows melt.
Would Ford be foolish enough to trade the seat of power at Queen’s Park for the slippery slopes of Parliament Hill? History tells us that flirting with federal politics is something of an occupational habit for ambitious provincial leaders and an occupational hazard for a breathless media.
Then-premier Bill Davis kept reporters on the ropes for months over a rumoured federal run in the early 1980s with his mischievous flirtation, equivocation and incantation: “I have no plans to have any plans.”
Even Dalton McGuinty sent up a federal Liberal leadership trial balloon when he announced his resignation as premier in late 2012. The distraction quickly fizzled, as did McGuinty.
But the current premier is a wild card, utterly unpredictable. When he lost Toronto’s 2014 mayoral race, who imagined him leapfrogging to Queen’s Park a few years later?
Unilingual, you say? Unimportant for many of today’s Tories — let’s see what they say of former Saskatchewan premier Brad Wall’s lack of French.
Asked about his prospects Tuesday — back when the question of O’Toole’s fate was more hypothetical than spectacle — Ford offered this homespun homily about staying close to home:
“No, I have my hands full — I love being premier of this province,” he began. “That’s my job. I’m just, you know, 24/7 working on getting us out of this pandemic.”
And then, this little tease, intended or not: “When I see this divide in this country and in this province, I want people united and we’re going to get there.”
Note the notion of uniting “this country.” This nation. His Ford Nation?
Spoiler alert: June 2 looms — voting day is a mere four months away, and the unofficial Ontario election campaign is already underway.
Never say never, but timing is always everything in politics. A major inhibition for his federal ambition is that Ford can’t be eyeing Ottawa while neglecting Ontario.
If Ford bides his time and doesn’t bite, some of his predecessors, and cabinet ministers, well might.
In which case, don’t rule out the possibility of two former Ontario Progressive Conservative leaders taking a run at it: Patrick Brown and John Tory are both big city mayors who speak French — Brown with a Brampton power base, Tory straddling Fortress Toronto.
And then there’s Stephen Lecce, who learned everything he knows about politics working for ex-PM Stephen Harper. Ottawa beckons him after being bashed for years by teachers in the education portfolio.
Consider Caroline Mulroney, who has nothing if not name recognition and language cognition. She will be exhorted to follow in the footsteps of her famous father, former PM Brian Mulroney, notwithstanding her humiliating third-place defeat by Ford in 2018, and the minor matter of her media phobia.
Regardless of whether Ford or any other Ontario Tories run for the leadership — or renounce it once and for all — they will be braced for the inevitable fallout from the federal contest. The rival Conservative candidates are likely to lapse into the same old hard-right ideas that don’t play well with the Ontario voters Ford needs to win re-election as premier — anti-abortion with hints of the homophobia, Islamophobia and hatred of gun control that seem to resurface in every race.
With a provincial election underway, Ontario’s PCs will frequently be put on the spot and have to distance themselves with damage control. The spillover will blur and blend the federal and provincial Tory brands.
For Ford, the baggage will get heavier. And the brass ring will remain a distant dream.

What Erin O'Toole's ousting means for BIPOC Canadians

Full text: Erin O’Toole is no longer the leader of the Conservative party. Seventy-three MPs voted to launch a leadership race, 13 more than needed to officially oust the one election leader.
How did this happen? Well, that would require a post-mortem longer than this article could allow, but simply put? O’Toole took the party on a fast-moving train to the political centre, something some MP’s and party members decried.
As one focused on fiscal responsibility, I personally had some reservations about the $100 billion dollars in new spending O’Toole’s platform called for, but as a Black gay man, I fully supported his endorsement of a conversion therapy ban and his unending support for communities of colour.
Just one day into Black History Month and I’m already asking myself, “how will my community fare under a new Tory leader?” Last year at this time (in this very same column) I asked, “ If Black loyalty to Liberals equates to our advancement, why do we still face so many challenges?”
Challenges for Canadians who are Black, Indigenous or people of colour (BIPOC) are even more pronounced this year due to an ongoing pandemic, inflation that has driven up the cost of living, and a housing crisis that all but promises to get worst. All of this on top of systemic inequities, discrimination that still exists in 2022, and barriers to resources and opportunities.
All that to say, a new CPC leader will need to understand the unique needs of BIPOC communities, should they wish to earn their support in vote-rich places like Ontario. After all, winning Ontario is an important part of the journey to the prime minister’s office.
Say what you will about Erin O’Toole, but he understood this. It’s exactly why he felt more progressive policies would help conservatives in places like the GTA. His detractors immediately denounced this strategy when conservatives failed to gain momentum in the GTA during the last election. Here’s the thing: they were wrong.
The reality is that perception takes time to change in the eyes of voters and it cannot be done in one cycle. Conservatives tried to capture more of the progressive vote by pulling to the centre, but fruits from those labours wouldn’t appear in just one cycle. For progressive voters, especially those part of BIPOC communities, they need to see a steady commitment to those policies and values over time before placing all their eggs in a big blue basket.
If conservatives win government in the next election, there will be many BIPOC Canadians counting on them to help heal long-existing fractures within their communities. The reality is that all Canadians will need this going forward. In order to successfully meet that need the conservatives must unite within their party; whether a social conservative, fiscal conservative, or progressive conservative. Division will all but certainly promise a continual descent to oblivion for the party, making way for liberals to govern for another 100 years.
A recently founded organization, the “ Majority Committee ,” is a group of Conservative supporters who were backing O’Toole.
“We represent the silent majority of Conservatives who are common-sense, solutions-focused and pragmatic,” founder Fraser Macondald said . “I worry quite a bit about the future of the party if we reverse course and the people who want to replace Mr. O’Toole make us an unviable and irrelevant option for mainstream voters.” The group will now likely seek to get involved in the next looming leadership.
As of publication, names floating around include MP Leslyn Lewis, Pierre Poilievre, Patrick Brown, and Peter MacKay, to name a few. But if any one of them is going to unite this country, they are going to have to unite their party first. Do it conservatives. BIPOC Canadians are depending on you.

'One and done': Inside the plot to oust O'Toole

Full text: For some Conservatives, it became clear more than a year ago that Erin O'Toole wasn't going to survive as leader of their party.
O'Toole himself didn't realize it until hours before he was ousted.
In that chasm between O'Toole and many members of his party - and the breakdown of good will and communication that created it - lie the reasons that 73 of 119 Conservative MPs voted on Wednesday to kick him out.
Some say it was O'Toole's flip-flops that did him in, others his attempt to move the party to the centre. Some say it was his stance on conversion therapy, others his failure to consult and communicate. Some say his leadership was a casualty of the pandemic.
One common thread that emerged from interviews with Conservative MPs, party staffers, organizers and others with long-standing ties to the party was perhaps best encapsulated by rookie MP Stephen Ellis:
"Democracy is a messy, messy way to do work."
O'Toole won leadership in August 2020, beating out the presumed front-runner Peter MacKay by appealing to the right wing of the party as a "true blue" Conservative and hoovering up support from social conservatives who felt alienated by MacKay's progressive approach.
In his victory speech, he pledged a renewed conservative movement, one that welcomed more Canadians, and many party members nodded in agreement.
In the months following that speech, however, O'Toole sidelined supporters of his rivals in the leadership contest, going so far as to kick one rival - Derek Sloan - out of the Conservative caucus altogether.
Then in March 2021, he gave a speech to the party's policy convention - and while some of its themes echoed his victory speech in August, his "true blue" credentials had already begun to fade in the eyes of the party's membership.
In the August speech, the grassroots heard words of optimism and renewal; in March, they heard insults as O'Toole emphasized the need for the party to have courage, and to prove to voters that it had grown and learned.
"We could get onside with moving the party, but not with being told there was something wrong with us," said one longtime MP.
"We're a big tent party, we always have been. But he started creating camps in that tent with that speech."
Next came carbon pricing. A month after the convention, without warning or briefing any of his MPs, O'Toole dropped a bombshell: the Tories were going to embrace the idea of putting a consumer price on carbon.
"Look, I hate carbon taxes," one MP told the Star this week. "Maybe he never could have convinced me it was the right approach, but he didn't even give us the dignity of being part of the conversation."
At that moment, the bonds of trust between the leader and his party's MPs began to break.
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic was also throwing up its own challenges.
The Conservative MPs elected in 2019 included many rookies who'd barely taken their seats in the House of Commons before the country closed its doors; another group followed in 2021, when pandemic restrictions remained.
Conservative MP Alex Ruff, a longtime O'Toole supporter, said the team-building necessary for new MPs under a new leader was impossible in the Zoom era.
In his view, what happened in the last week of O'Toole's leadership was a reflection of the pandemic.
"This was about two years of being locked up, frustrated and without being able to come together in person as a team," he said.
People close to O'Toole now acknowledge that he never had a good enough read on his MPs, often minimizing issues and problems or catching up with them too late.
At the point in last summer's election campaign when the Conservatives were on track to potentially form a minority government, many figured that a victory would help soothe some of the ongoing tensions.
Except O'Toole didn't win.
And even as he struck an optimistic tone in the days that followed, his supporters sensed that the beginning of the end could be upon them.
"It was one and done," said a long-time Conservative organizer. "That was the precedent set for Andrew Scheer, and that's what was going to happen to us."
Nonetheless, his team thought they could make it to 2023, when O'Toole would face the leadership review required by the party's constitution. With enough time, some felt they could still turn the ship around.
Deputizing defeated MP James Cumming to conduct a review of the campaign's failings would give them time to present a plan and a path forward, O'Toole's team believed. Maybe they could persuade the caucus - and the party's members - to give him another chance.
It seemed to help that many Conservatives believe in the right of the party's grassroots to handle all matters of leadership.
That's why, in their first meeting of the post-election era, the Conservative MPs were not unanimously in favour of adopting a provision of the Reform Act, which gives a party's MPs the power to call for a leadership review if 20 per cent of caucus wants one.
But the provision was adopted nonetheless. At the time, O'Toole said it was a not a "sword of Damocles" hanging over his head - but that was exactly what it became.
Getting 20 per cent of caucus to sign up took time but, in the end, not as much as even the organizers anticipated.
The irritants had piled up: A snap motion to push a bill banning conversion therapy all the way to the Senate; an apparent flip-flop over mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations on Parliament Hill; a leak of a damaging story about Alberta MP Shannon Stubbs, in what was perceived as retribution for her call for an earlier leadership review.
What his MPs saw as signs of disrespect were considered by O'Toole's team to be the necessary work of bringing a restive group to heel.
Closing out 2021 was the "bloodbath" in a December caucus meeting over Quebec's Bill 21, which prohibits those in positions of public authority from wearing religious symbols at work.
That meeting would set the course for the final days of O'Toole's leadership.
A motion was put up for debate at the next meeting that would see the party condemn Bill 21 in no uncertain terms - even though the party's official policy was that Quebec lawmakers had the right to do as they liked. O'Toole's inner circle saw it as a trap. Adopting the motion would create a new fissure in caucus between its Quebec MPs and those opposed to Bill 21.
It seemed that the leaders detractors were not going to stop until they triggered a leadership review.
Internal pressure was brought to bear on O'Toole to consider what grassroots Tories had been asking for via several competing petitions, including one from Conservative Sen. Denise Batters: Move up the leadership review.
Then, a week ago Monday, O'Toole gave what many considered a disjointed news conference about the imminent arrival of a trucker convoy in Ottawa. Few knew at the time that his wife Rebecca had just come through surgery, multiple sources told the Star, while O'Toole was juggling the return of Parliament, his restive caucus and the need for a thoughtful response to the demands of the protesters.
His response didn't land well, and his team knew it. For the next four days, they would fight over how to deal with the convoy.
Videos were shot and shelved, lines argued over. In the meantime, some of his MPs were loudly and proudly backing the truckers.
A caucus retreat that same week turned into a shambles.
One MP took the microphone and gave O'Toole an intense and emotional dressing drown over his handling of COVID-19 vaccination requirements for MPs; when O'Toole suggested they continue the conversation elsewhere, the MP flat-out refused.
The second day of the meeting featured Cummings's post mortem of the 2021 election campaign - but details from it were being leaked to the media even as O'Toole's MPs were hearing them for the first time.
The renewed sense of being disrespected, and the fact there was no obvious plan for change in the campaign report, spurred meetings that night on how to gather enough signatures to force a vote on O'Toole's leadership.
"A letter like this doesn't come because of a single policy or an ideological divide," said one MP.
"It's about character."
Both sides started making calls over the weekend.
By Monday, it was clear that enough signatures had been gathered to trigger the vote.
O'Toole's team lashed out, portraying the organizers as acolytes of former leader Andrew Scheer, or members of "the conversion crew" who were still angry about the handling of the conversion therapy bill.
Later that night, O'Toole would issue a statement suggesting there were forces at work trying to drag the party down.
One longtime MP, who said they are in none of those camps, said it was O'Toole's response that cemented his decision to vote him out.
"I had such high hopes for him as a leader," the MP said, "but I've been left totally disappointed and disillusioned."
Two MPs told the Star their colleagues lied to O'Toole when he called canvassing for their support, a move many framed as payback for the times they felt O'Toole had deceived them.
"Our support was soft," said one O'Toole loyalist, "and we couldn't harden it up."
In his last-ditch pitch to caucus to keep him on, O'Toole pointed to the party's gains and growth on his watch.
He promised to move up the leadership review and let the members have their say.
They will now, MPs say, whenever the next leadership race is called.
As for O'Toole, he insists there's no bad seat in the House of Commons, and says he wants to stay as the MP for Durham.
"I pledge my support and unwavering loyalty to our next leader," he said following his ouster, "and I urge everyone in our party to come together and do the same."

Firing O'Toole an opportunity, not a crisis

Full text: Since the Conservative caucus dumped Erin O'Toole as leader on Wednesday, some have suggested the party is now doomed - that its best chance for mainstream electability was thrown out the window, and that by courting its populist and social conservative flanks, the party relegates itself to a longer stint on the opposition benches. I believe this is too simplistic a read on what happened and ignores the opportunity ahead.
The move to show O'Toole the door was an overwhelming condemnation of O'Toole himself. As one caucus member put it to me Thursday, "He's a hypocrite." The vote was not a condemnation of the more centrist approach O'Toole espoused, it was a denunciation of his performance. Yes, social conservatives are upset with O'Toole. But he betrayed them by courting their support during the leadership race by pretending to be a candidate he had no plans to be.
Discussions about the Conservative party often focus on the challenge of having a large base of social conservatives. They are very influential, and they are organized. Activists dominate many riding associations. They stack delegate nomination meetings to ensure their own supporters vote at party conventions. They're important volunteers who can either help elect candidates or mount challenges against sitting MPs during nomination battles. They are also an important donor base.
But they have not - yet -been the majority of the party.
If O'Toole ran his leadership campaign in 2020 on the platform he presented to Canadians during the 2021 election campaign - pro-choice, in favour of carbon pricing and a temporary ban on assault-style weapons -he would have run to the left of Peter MacKay, a pro-choice candidate, and lost.
O'Toole only became leader by being the second choice of supporters of Derek Sloan and Leslyn Lewis. With two pro-choice candidates, it's safe to assume social conservatives would have left the rest of their preferential ballots blank.
The last time abortion was debated at a Conservative convention was in 2018. The motion, to delete a line in the policy book stating a Conservative government will not support any legislation to regulate abortion, was defeated by a vote of 53 per cent against. Tight, uncomfortably so, but still a defeat. In 2016, 70 per cent of Conservative delegates voted to strike the definition of marriage as a union between one man and one woman from the Tories' policy book.
The message here is clear: the party belongs to those who show up. The fight for what becomes of the Conservative party will happen over the next several months. The next leader will set the tone, the policy priorities, and the parameters of the party's coalition.
If those who are socially progressive and fiscally conservative sit out the fight, that coalition may be dominated by the social conservatives and far-right populists who some in the party now seem preoccupied in courting. So, find desirable candidates. Sell memberships. The formula is not complicated.
It took the Liberals two tries and a near-death experience after Paul Martin to land on Justin Trudeau. The Conservatives are not doomed. They just need to find someone willing to step up and do the work that's required to build a party that reflects the country.
There should be a Conservative leader unafraid to denounce the truck convoy occupying Ottawa. Someone willing to say people have the right to peaceful assembly, but it doesn't look like this. A leader who expresses alarm at the presence of Nazi and Confederate flags, and doesn't just refer to the people waving them as "bad apples."
It should also be possible to have a leader capable of empathy - one who says people who lose their jobs because they refuse to be vaccinated, for whatever reason, should have access to a job bank where employers don't require vaccinations. That the country's safety net includes all Canadians, not just those whose views we agree with.
(To be clear, I remain convinced that not getting vaccinated is a selfish position. The "freedom" signs lining the fence of the parliamentary precinct might as well say "Let more people die" or "Undermine health care." But I also think many who refuse to get vaccinated are scared and misinformed, and I don't think they should lose their houses or have their children go hungry.)
Some of the names currently being tossed around as potential Conservative leaders concern me. I hope the Tories don't settle on a divisive leader who spreads misinformation convincingly.
Canada needs a broad-based party that can challenge the Liberals for power. Not only do the voters deserve choice, but this will help prevent the Grits from being lazy and ensure more accountable government.

Full text: OTTAWA — Another race to pick a new Conservative party leader is on.
And in the colourful words of one Conservative MP after Wednesday’s coup that toppled Erin O’Toole, “It’s gonna be a bloody tough job.”
A short race favours the already known and the already well-organized. A longer contest will give others a shot at it.
This will be the fourth leadership contest since the party was born of the 2003 merger between the Reform/Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives.
Here’s your cheat sheet on those around whom speculation is swirling:

- Pierre Poilievre : The early front-runner. Finance critic, 42. Career politician, former cabinet minister and political aide. Upstaged both O’Toole and Andrew Scheer with savage attacks on Liberal spending policies. Fiscal hawk. Social media savvy. Strong organizer. Poilievre embraced the so-called “Freedom Convoy” plaguing downtown Ottawa now, calling its participants “Bright, joyful & peaceful Canadians championing freedom over fear on Parliament Hill.” If he doesn’t drop out of the race like he did last time, the job could be his to lose.



- Peter MacKay : The longtime aspirant. Lawyer, 56. Former leader of the Progressive Conservative party, who merged it with the Canadian Alliance and stepped aside as Harper ran to take over. Cabinet minister under Harper. Left politics in 2015 ahead of that year’s election. Tried to make a comeback in 2020. Ran to replace Scheer. Despite more caucus support including among many socially conservative MPs, he lost to O’Toole and is still paying off that debt. Now living in Nova Scotia, MacKay works with Deloitte and law firm McInnes Cooper. He is undoubtedly interested again, but much depends on what rules the party sets out.



- Rona Ambrose : Gone but not forgotten. Former interim leader, 52, A Harper cabinet minister, she stepped up when he stepped down after losing in 2015. Socially progressive. Fiscally conservative. Ambrose unified a bruised caucus and was an effective critic of the rookie Trudeau government. Her bio touts that she was the “first leader of the Conservative party to back equal marriage and march in a gay pride parade.” Ambrose now sits on several corporate boards and think tanks, and opted out of the last leadership race. She would start as the strongest female candidate and could rally a lot of support, but may not take the leap.



- Leslyn Lewis : Social conservative standard bearer. Rookie MP, 51. A Jamaican-born lawyer, Lewis blew onto the political scene when she ran against O’Toole for the leadership in 2020 and rallied the social conservative wing of the party. An opponent of abortion and COVID-19 vaccination mandates, she bitterly clashed with O’Toole’s team in the Conservative caucus. Tweeted, “The media and the power structure expect me to sit in the back of the bus. I won’t!” Her fans may want her to run again, but sources say Lewis has privately told others that she will not.



- Michelle Rempel Garner : Western warrior. Prominent Calgary MP, 41. Feminist with an economics degree, sommelier skills and a pro-business, pro-gun bent. Socially progressive, fiscally conservative. Strong advocate for LGBTQ rights. Takes no guff on social media. As an opposition critic, she is a cabinet minister’s worst nightmare. Married to a retired U.S. army veteran, she will be urged to run in the race and has flirted with the possibility in the past. One to watch.



- Brad Wall : Former premier and Saskatchewan Party leader. Bright, quotable, 56. A consultant and political pundit, he left provincial politics in 2017 after a decade in power. His name is often floated for the national job but Wall doesn’t speak French and has not thrown his hat into the ring the last two times the leadership came open, perhaps mindful you need to parlez vous in Parliament.



- Patrick Brown : Political animal. Brampton mayor, 43. A former Conservative MP who became leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, then got bounced by his PC caucus amid allegations of misconduct. Definitely kicking the tires at a federal run, sources said Wednesday.



- Caroline Mulroney : Ontario cabinet minister. Lawyer, bilingual, 47. Politically ambitious. The eldest child of former prime minister Brian Mulroney, and the only one to make the leap into elected politics, she ran for the Ontario PC leadership before she’d even run as an MPP. After a rocky start, is finding her feet as a provincial cabinet minister. May be too soon for a successful detour into federal politics.



- Doug Ford: Ontario premier. Chief Etobicoke cheerleader, 57. Timing is everything, and it’s not on Ford’s side, this time. Several close to the premier believe he harbours a desire to be prime minister but faces a looming provincial election. Told reporters this week he has “my hands full. I love being premier of this province, we’re going to build this province, and I’m going to continue leading this province.” So that’s a hard maybe.



- Andrew Scheer : Saskatchewan MP. Former Conservative leader and former Commons speaker, 42. Some of his caucus colleagues rue the day he was forced to step down after losing the 2019 election and would love to see him back. But Scheer has ruled out a comeback and wants to remain, as one supporter said, as a team player and one day serve as a cabinet minister in a Conservative government.

Ontario's integrity commissioner finds no wrongdoing in proposed rerouting of Bradford Bypass

Full text: Ontario’s integrity commissioner has found no evidence of wrongdoing by Transportation Minister Caroline Mulroney or Associate Minister Stan Cho in the government’s proposed rerouting of the planned Bradford Bypass.
The proposed route change of the controversial highway would send it around Cho’s father’s property in East Gwillimbury instead of cutting through it.
Integrity commissioner J. David Wake’s report was in response to a complaint filed by NDP MPP Taras Natyshak, who called for an investigation into Premier Doug Ford, Mulroney and Cho, alleging there was conflict of interest and undue influence over the Bradford Bypass.
The MPP’s complaint followed a joint investigation by Torstar and Canada’s National Observer last October , which found Associate Minister Cho’s father co-owns Silver Lakes Golf and Country Club in East Gwillimbury — a property that would be spared under the recently proposed route change.
“On the information available to me I was satisfied that neither Minister Mulroney, Mr. Cho nor their staff had any involvement in directing the process which led to a proposed highway realignment avoiding the golf course,” the commissioner said in his 12-page report.
Wake had previously cleared Ford of any conflict of interest in the planning of the 16.2-km Bradford Bypass, which would connect Highways 404 and 400.
A senior ministry of transportation official told the commissioner that the route change was made by staff and consultants working in the ministry with no involvement from Mulroney and her staff.
Mulroney told the commissioner that she did not know of the change to the proposed route that would circumvent Cho’s father’s business and was never briefed on it until she informed herself for the purposes of responding to Natyshak’s complaint, according to the report.
“I find that there is not only insufficient evidence to support Mr. Natyshak’s allegations, but what evidence there is points very much in the opposite direction,” the commissioner said in his report.
Cho’s office had told Torstar/Observer that the MPP declared a conflict of interest upon his appointment, with a protocol in place blocking his access to information related to the bypass.
In a submission to the commissioner, Mulroney rejected Natyshak’s allegation that she may have allowed information relayed to her by Cho concerning the route of the bypass to influence the ministry of transportation’s decision to propose the route.
“I had no information from Associate Minister Cho, and I have done nothing to influence the route of the bypass, let alone to further my private interest or to improperly further another person’s private interest,” Mulroney is quoted as saying in the report.
Mulroney said she was aware that Cho’s father had an ownership interest in Silver Lakes but never discussed the matter with him because “she felt it would be inappropriate.”
Mulroney confirmed Cho invited her to his father’s golf course in East Gwillimbury in March, weeks before the proposed route change was announced. She said she attended in her capacity as MPP for York-Simcoe, and did not discuss anything related to her role as Minister of Transportation or to the Bradford Bypass.
Cho, an MPP for Willowdale, joined her at Silver Lakes because he knew she would meet his parents and he wanted to be present “because I am so proud of them,” the report said.
“I am happy he has made clear what I have maintained now for months — I was not involved in any decisions regarding the routing of the Bradford Bypass,” Cho tweeted in response to the commissioner’s report.
In his statement, he said his parents who built their lives in Canada from scratch have been subjected to racist attacks following the Star article about the rerouting of the bypass. He said he expects an apology from the NDP for jumping to conclusions.
In her tweet, Mulroney said, “We are moving full steam ahead with the Bradford Bypass and other critically needed transportation projects across the province.”
The Bradford Bypass, a key pledge in the Tories’ June 2 re-election campaign, would cross 27 waterways and cut through environmentally sensitive Holland Marsh lands, impacting about 39 hectares of wildlife habitat and 11 hectares of wetlands.

Full text: OTTAWA — Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole and his team worked furiously to salvage his leadership Tuesday, on the eve of a crucial caucus vote that some party insiders predicted he has little chance of surviving.
Conservative MPs are set to vote Wednesday on whether O’Toole ought to stay on as leader. If a majority of them don’t agree that he should, he’ll be shown the door.
O’Toole and some of his closest allies were working the phones Tuesday, trying to gauge whether that majority exists. But sources told the Star that his team was reaching out in some cases to MPs who have already signed on to the effort to dump him.
“He doesn’t have the support he thinks he does,” said one MP, speaking on the condition they not be named to freely discuss internal party matters.
Thirty-five MPs are squarely in favour of ousting O’Toole, having signed a letter calling for a vote on whether he should remain on as leader.
That effort began immediately after the Conservatives failed to beat the Liberals in the 2021 election, and has gained momentum in fits and starts as the party has struggled to make gains in popular support.
Things came to a head last week, when Conservative MPs heard the results of the party’s election review. During a heated meeting, some caucus members openly challenged O’Toole in a way that left many with the impression his days were numbered.
When news of the effort to remove him broke Monday, O’Toole’s response painted his critics as wanting to take the party down an angry and negative path, one that he characterized as a political dead end.
He returned to that theme Tuesday during calls with his MPs, several told the Star, and promised new approaches on policy.
But trying to characterize his opponents as belonging to specific wings of the party — he cited those opposed to vaccination among them — just made him new enemies, several Conservative MPs said.
“He’s doing exactly what he criticizes Justin Trudeau for doing — dividing people, and pitting them against each other,” one MP said.
That in turn is uniting O’Toole’s critics against him, another MP said, because there is a common thread that links his detractors: broken trust.
“There is no policy idea he could put forward that would fix any of this,” the MP said.
The process for a leadership review is enshrined in the Reform Act, legislation designed to give MPs more power over how their caucus runs.
To trigger a leadership review, a written notice signed by at least 20 per cent of the party’s caucus is sent to the chair. With 35 of the caucus’s 119 members having signed the letter, that threshold has been met.
A vote by secret ballot will be held electronically during a caucus meeting Wednesday on Zoom.
O’Toole only needs a simple majority of votes in his favour to claim the support of his caucus. However, as one MP put it to the Star on Tuesday, “even if he gets it, he doesn’t really have it,” given that 35 MPs have already moved against him.
If the MPs vote to replace O’Toole, a vote to choose an interim leader will be held later Wednesday evening. Names already in the mix Tuesday were deputy leader Candice Bergen, Quebec MP Gerard Deltell and former Tory cabinet minister Ed Fast.
Bergen was among the handful of Conservative MPs who voiced support for O’Toole on Tuesday.
“I want Erin O’Toole to remain as leader,” she told reporters.
While grassroots efforts to turf O’Toole have sprung up since the election, one in support of his continued leadership was relaunched on Tuesday.
Fraser Macdonald, a former Conservative campaign manager in Pickering-Uxbridge, is one of the organizers of the Majority Committee, which he said is meant to encourage a silent majority of Tories who support O’Toole’s approach to come forward.
He said their perspectives are never voiced as loudly as those who feel the party needs to tack farther right, and it’s time for a change.
“It’s hard to get people to march in the streets about moderate policy,” Macdonald said.
Macdonald launched a petition after the 2021 election to encourage O’Toole to stay on, an effort that O’Toole seized upon as proof that he still had the support of party members.
Macdonald told the Star Tuesday afternoon that he hadn’t been in contact with O’Toole’s team.
Several former Tory candidates, including some in the Greater Toronto Area, voiced support for O’Toole on Tuesday, as did Alberta MP Tim Uppal and Nova Scotia MP Chris D’Entremont.
Finance critic Pierre Poilievre, who had contemplated a run for leadership in the 2020 race that O’Toole ultimately won, did not return a request for comment Tuesday.
Poilievre’s name tops the lists of many party insiders as the person who make a bid if a leadership contest is called.
Another potential contender has already turned down the job. Premier Doug Ford said Tuesday he has no interest in pursuing the federal leadership.
“I have my hands full. I love being premier of this province. We’re going to build this province, and I’m going to continue leading this province,” said Ford, whose Progressive Conservative government is up for re-election on June 2.
“That’s my job, 24-7. I want to unite this province. I can’t stand this divide,” he said.

Ontario confirms 290 medical exemptions from COVID-19 vaccinations

Full text: Ontario has granted fewer than 300 medical exemptions from COVID-19 vaccinations a month into a new system that requires them to be verified by local health units — a measure intended to cut down on fraud .
Now integrated into QR codes used under the proof-of-vaccination system to get into gyms, cinemas, sporting events, restaurants, bars, concert halls and other venues, the exemptions replace the previous regime in which patrons could show an exemption letter from a doctor to gain entry.
There were 290 medical exemptions registered in the provincial COVax computer system as of Monday’s reopening , according to government figures provided to the Star. Ontario’s population is approximately 14.7 million.
The relatively low number suggests the new system is working in the wake of concerns from chief medical officer Dr. Kieran Moore that no more than five in 100,000 Ontarians have specific and rare medical conditions that medically qualify them for vaccination exemptions, officials said.
“We’re very pleased that given the limited number of valid medical exemptions issued to date, the process is working and individuals with legitimate medical exemptions are able to be accommodated,” said Alexandra Hilkene, a spokesperson for Health Minister Christine Elliott.
Critics complained the old system of presenting doctor’s letters was ripe for abuse and forgeries. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario is investigating more than 40 doctors for COVID-19-related issues, which include potentially bogus exemptions.
One government source told the Star last fall that “we’ve seen the same doctors giving out exemptions to everyone who asks.” It’s not known how many potentially invalid exemption letters were circulating.
Health units in Ontario have granted another 234 exemptions to citizens participating in vaccine trials.
Concerns about exemptions were amplified in the fall when two of Premier Doug Ford’s then-70 MPPs claimed them — a statistical anomaly.
Lindsey Park (Durham) and Christina Mitas of (Scarborough Centre) have announced they will not run in the June 2 election. Park quit the Progressive Conservative caucus last fall, leaving Mitas as the lone unvaccinated Tory MPP after the premier required all his members to be vaccinated unless they had a valid exemption.
Toronto Public Health said it has received 79 exemption requests from qualified medical practitioners and confirmed 58 of them. Eight were denied, and doctors or nurse practitioners who submitted another 13 have been asked for more detail “ due to incomplete information in the initial submission.”
“Designated Toronto Public Health staff reviews each request to ensure the practitioner is qualified to make a submission according to the province’s criteria and that the information provided on the submission template complies with those criteria,” the health unit added in a statement.
In neighbouring Peel, medical professionals can submit exemption applications to a secure online portal launched last week. To date, two exemptions have been requested and both were granted, Peel Public Health told the Star on Tuesday.
York Region Public Health reported 22 exemption requests with 20 approved, a rate of 1.8 per 100,000 residents — well below the statistical threshold set by Moore.
“Individuals without a clinic assessment from an Ontario health care professional will not be considered medical exempt from receiving the COVID-19 vaccine,” said York Region spokesperson Melissa Pinto.
The Durham Region public health unit has received 11 exemption requests. Nine were granted and two remain under review.

Full text: No matter what happens tomorrow — whether Conservative MPs show Erin O’Toole the door or keep him as leader — the result will be a deeply divided caucus and a dead or dying leader at their feet.
MPs expect the vote will be close; each side is predicting victory.
The group of MPs who want to see O’Toole gone hold various grievances about their leader.
Some believe O’Toole’s office leaked disparaging information about Alberta MP Shannon Stubbs to a newspaper and that the leader lied about it to caucus.
Some feel betrayed O’Toole promised to uphold conscience rights during his leadership, only to reverse course during the election campaign and surprise MPs with a unanimous consent motion in Parliament giving swift passage to the Liberals’ conversion therapy ban.
Some are disappointed the party lost seats in Western Canada and failed to crack the suburbs around the Greater Toronto Area. They feel the leader is insufficiently focused on outreach to ethnic communities, and are dismayed he won’t denounce Quebec’s discriminatory Bill 21.
Some just don’t like him. Many, actually. Several Conservatives during the last leadership race told me they chose to support Peter MacKay, despite his pro-choice stance, because they felt he was a better person. In the past week, O’Toole has been called a bully privately, and a liar publicly by his own MPs. Under the cloak of anonymity, they speak of his vindictiveness.
Mostly what unites the dissenters is a belief that they cannot win with O’Toole at the helm. That his flip flops, over the carbon tax, gun control, or even last week’s meeting with truckers, are too frequent. That O’Toole can’t take a stand or keep his message focused. That he lacks authenticity. This view, coupled with his declining approval rating, last week’s whitewash report of his election performance, and the party’s latest fundraising numbers — the worst Q4 result since 2004 — made for a toxic brew.
Those who support O’Toole mostly share the vision he now espouses — a desire to see the party reach towards the political centre to disenchanted blue Liberals and blue-collar New Democrats and a belief that this is key to making inroads in suburban areas and winning government. They want a leader who is pro-choice and believes human activity causes climate change.
Ironically, O’Toole, who ran for his party’s leadership as a “true blue” Conservative and painted MacKay, his opponent, as liberal light, is now dependent on MacKay’s supporters to ensure his leadership survives.
In this group too, however, there are those who dislike the leader. These fence sitters mostly fear what’s next.
A vote that gets rid of O’Toole will likely mean a short leadership race — it is a minority government after all. That benefits leadership contenders that already have a firm grip on the party, a base they can mobilize, such as popular Ottawa-area MP Pierre Poilievre, or Haldimand—Norfolk MP Leslyn Lewis, a favourite amongst social conservatives. There will be little time for newcomers to get organized.
Both Poilievre and Lewis recently promoted their presence at the truck convoy protest. Although both espouse messages of unity, there is a fear shared by some MPs that under their leadership, the party would be catering to a right wing that could hold it hostage just as the convoy has done to Ottawa. Few of these MPs want to see their party co-opted, like the U.S. Republican party, by more extremist elements, further alienating them from mainstream voters.
O’Toole has played to these concerns. In his late-night missive on social media Monday, he told the party there are two roads open to the Conservatives: a dead-end angry, negative, and extreme road that will see the Tories become “the NDP of the right.” And another road, that is inclusive, optimistic, full of ideas and hope. (The suggestion is that this is the road O’Toole will take though it isn’t clear it’s the one he is on.) He welcomed the vote calling it a “time for reckoning,” and urging caucus to settle the issue “Right here. Right now. Once and for all.”
Of course, if he manages to hang on, questions about his leadership won’t be put to rest once and for all.
O’Toole will still face calls by electoral district associations for an earlier leadership review from party members, a petition from Sen. Denise Batters calling for the same; and if those efforts fail, a leadership vote in August 2023. (Though some dissenters fear O’Toole will push this leadership review back arguing that the party shouldn’t be destabilized so close to a possible election.)
Whether he wins or loses Wednesday, O’Toole will still have lost. His caucus will be split; his leadership still challenged. And if he goes on a witch hunt, punishing or turfing more than a third of his MPs, as some fear, his party will be further weakened.

Full text: For many long years, the federal Conservatives have been two factions warring in the bosom of a single party.
That alone means it’s not entirely a bad thing for leader Erin O’Toole to have a caucus revolt brought into the open and for the party’s MPs to have to decide what they want to be.
For O’Toole personally, a clean execution is probably preferable to a slow death by a thousand treacheries.
To his credit, he welcomed the challenge to his leadership by about a third of his MPs. And he aptly laid out the stark choice they face.
“There are two roads open to the party,” O’Toole said. “(One) is angry, negative and extreme. It is a dead end.”
The other, he went on, is “to recognize that conservatism is organic, not static, and that a winning message is one of inclusion, optimism, ideas, and hope.”
That’s the path to a more modern middle that O’Toole has followed, if erratically, since he succeeded Andrew Scheer as leader.
The Conservative rift has longstanding fault lines. In the 1980s, former prime minister Brian Mulroney married western conservatives, Ontario moderates and Quebec nationalists in a Progressive Conservative coalition that delivered two sweeping majorities.
But that union didn’t hold.
Western discontent gave rise to the Reform party; in Quebec there rose the Bloc Québécois. Then came the Canadian Alliance, which swallowed the remnant PCs to become the more right-wing Conservative Party of Canada.
For a time, power allowed former PM Stephen Harper to paper over the cracks. Loss of it exposed Scheer and O’Toole to the challenge of trying to reconcile disparate wings of the party without the carrots and sticks of office.
It’s no coincidence that the Conservative festering erupted in tandem with the egregious display by protesters jamming the streets of Ottawa this week.
The standoff in the streets is the Conservative identity crisis made manifest.
The challenge to O’Toole’s leadership has been coming since the disappointing results of last year’s federal election that saw re-election of a Liberal minority, and since he had the party back a bill banning conversion therapy.
It all adds up to a very good week for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Liberals.
Both the appalling antics of the demonstrators and the internal Conservative ruckus makes Trudeau look strong, settled and serene by comparison.
For their part, both O’Toole and the Conservative rebels face unpalatable options.
The party can either moderate and follow O’Toole’s move to the centre or consign itself to a long stint on the margins as champions of a constituency that isn’t big enough ever to form government.
If O’Toole’s critics do manage to yank the party back in line with its conservative base, it would be a classic Pyrrhic victory. It would deny the basic reality of where Canadian elections are won. It’s the road to oblivion.
For O’Toole, his continued leadership is already probably untenable.
If he loses the caucus challenge, he’s out as leader. But even if he fights it off, the implacable wing of his party demanding his ouster is not going away. The internecine intrigue will continue.
It’s axiomatic in politics that the greatest danger to a leader comes as often from his or her supposed friends as from foes. To his considerable dismay, Erin O’Toole is discovering the truth of that.
Meanwhile, the prime minister and the Liberals can look on with no small satisfaction.

Full text: Yes Doug Ford is premier, but a province is not a nation.
Why not Ford Nation - prime minister of all Canada?
Ford has never given up his dream of winning the bigger "brass ring" on Parliament Hill. Those are the words he has used in private moments to describe the one big achievement that still eludes him today.
Now, with Wednesday's defenestration of Erin O'Toole as federal Conservative leader, a window of opportunity has opened wider for that still-tempting brass ring. With the leadership up for grabs again, is Ford ready to act on his lingering political fantasy?
Surely there are many good reasons to discount this bad idea. But don't count him out just yet, not until you've answered today's question and tomorrow's thought experiment:
Who is the most powerful of all Tories in Canada today?
When Ford repurposed himself as the populist premier of the most populous province in Canada, he was quickly regarded as a rock star among his fellow travellers. When he popped up at a federal Conservative convention in 2018, delegates relegated the party's new national leader at the time, Andrew Scheer, to taking pictures of them with Ford.
Many other Ontario contenders and pretenders will be fielding phone calls today (more on that later). But all eyes are on the premier who will have his ear to the ground - and his cellphone - until the snows melt.
Would Ford be foolish enough to trade the seat of power at Queen's Park for the slippery slopes of Parliament Hill? History tells us that flirting with federal politics is something of an occupational habit for ambitious provincial leaders and an occupational hazard for a breathless media.
Then-premier Bill Davis kept reporters on the ropes for months over a rumoured federal run in the early 1980s with his mischievous flirtation, equivocation and incantation: "I have no plans to have any plans."
Even Dalton McGuinty sent up a federal Liberal leadership trial balloon when he announced his resignation as premier in late 2012. The distraction quickly fizzled, as did McGuinty.
But the current premier is a wild card, utterly unpredictable. When he lost Toronto's 2014 mayoral race, who imagined him leapfrogging to Queen's Park a year later?
Unilingual, you say? Unimportant for many of today's Tories - let's see what they say of former Saskatchewan premier Brad Wall's lack of French.
Asked about his prospects Tuesday - back when the question of O'Toole's fate was more hypothetical than spectacle - Ford offered this homespun homily about staying close to home:
"No, I have my hands full - I love being premier of this province," he began. "That's my job. I'm just, you know, 24/7 working on getting us out of this pandemic."
And then, this little tease, intended or not: "When I see this divide in this country and in this province, I want people united and we're going to get there."
Note the notion of uniting "this country." This nation. His Ford Nation?
Spoiler alert: June 2 looms - voting day is a mere four months away, and the unofficial Ontario election campaign is already underway.
Never say never, but timing is always everything in politics. A major inhibition for his federal ambition is that Ford can't be eyeing Ottawa while neglecting Ontario.
If Ford bides his time and doesn't bite, some of his predecessors, and cabinet ministers, well might.
In which case, don't rule out the possibility of two former Ontario Progressive Conservative leaders taking a run at it: Patrick Brown and John Tory are both big city mayors who speak French - Brown with a Brampton power base, Tory straddling Fortress Toronto.
And then there's Stephen Lecce, who learned everything he knows about politics working for ex-PM Stephen Harper.
Ottawa beckons him after being bashed for years by teachers in the education portfolio.
Consider Caroline Mulroney, who has nothing if not name recognition and language cognition. She will be exhorted to follow in the footsteps of her famous father, former PM Brian Mulroney, notwithstanding her humiliating third-place defeat by Ford in 2018, and the minor matter of her media phobia.
Regardless of whether Ford or any other Ontario Tories run for the leadership - or renounce it once and for all - they will be braced for the inevitable fallout from the federal contest. The rival Conservative candidates are likely to lapse into the same old hard-right ideas that don't play well with the Ontario voters Ford needs to win re-election as premier - anti-abortion with hints of the homophobia, Islamophobia and hatred of gun control that seem to resurface in every race.
With a provincial election underway, Ontario's PCs will frequently be put on the spot and have to distance themselves with damage control. The spillover will blur and blend the federal and provincial Tory brands.
For Ford, the baggage will get heavier. And the brass ring will remain a distant dream.

Full text: Another race to pick a new Conservative party leader is on.
And in the colourful words of one Conservative MP after Wednesday's coup that toppled Erin O'Toole: "It's gonna be a bloody tough job."
A short race favours the already known and the already well-organized. A longer contest will give others a shot at it.
This will be the fourth leadership contest since the party was born of the 2003 merger between the Reform/Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives.
Here's your cheat sheet on those around whom speculation is swirling:
Pierre Poilievre The early front-runner. Finance critic, 42. Career politician, former cabinet minister and political aide. Upstaged both O'Toole and Andrew Scheer with savage attacks on Liberal spending policies. Fiscal hawk. Social media savvy. Strong organizer. Poilievre embraced the so-called "Freedom Convoy" plaguing downtown Ottawa now, calling its participants "Bright, joyful & peaceful Canadians championing freedom over fear on Parliament Hill." If he doesn't drop out of the race like he did last time, the job could be his to lose.
Peter MacKay The longtime aspirant. Lawyer, 56. Former leader of the Progressive Conservative party, who merged it with the Canadian Alliance and stepped aside as Harper ran to take over. Cabinet minister under Harper. Left politics in 2015 ahead of that year's election. Tried to make a comeback in 2020. Ran to replace Scheer. Despite more caucus support including among many socially conservative MPs, he lost to O'Toole and is still paying off that debt. Now living in Nova Scotia, MacKay works with Deloitte and law firm McInnes Cooper. He is undoubtedly interested again, but much depends on what rules the party sets out.
Rona Ambrose Gone but not forgotten. Former interim leader, 52, A Harper cabinet minister, she stepped up when he stepped down after losing in 2015. Socially progressive. Fiscally conservative. Ambrose unified a bruised caucus and was an effective critic of the rookie Trudeau government. Her bio touts that she was the "first leader of the Conservative party to back equal marriage and march in a gay pride parade." Ambrose now sits on several corporate boards and think tanks, and opted out of the last leadership race. She would start as the strongest female candidate and could rally a lot of support, but may not take the leap.
Leslyn Lewis Social conservative standard bearer. Rookie MP, 51. A Jamaican-born lawyer, Lewis blew onto the political scene when she ran against O'Toole for the leadership in 2020 and rallied the social conservative wing of the party. An opponent of abortion and COVID-19 vaccination mandates, she bitterly clashed with O'Toole's team in the Conservative caucus. Tweeted, "The media and the power structure expect me to sit in the back of the bus. I won't!" Her fans may want her to run again, but sources say Lewis has privately told others that she will not.
Michelle Rempel Garner Western warrior. Prominent Calgary MP, 41. Feminist with an economics degree, sommelier skills and a pro-business, pro-gun bent. Socially progressive, fiscally conservative. Strong advocate for LGBTQ rights. Takes no guff on social media. As an opposition critic, she is a cabinet minister's worst nightmare. Married to a retired U.S. army veteran, she will be urged to run in the race and has flirted with the possibility in the past. One to watch.
Brad Wall Former premier and Saskatchewan Party leader. Bright, quotable, 56. A consultant and political pundit, he left provincial politics in 2017 after a decade in power. His name is often floated for the national job, but Wall doesn't speak French and has not thrown his hat into the ring the last two times the leadership came open, perhaps mindful you need to parlez vous in Parliament.
Patrick Brown Political animal. Brampton mayor, 43. A former Conservative MP who became leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, then got bounced by his PC caucus amid allegations of misconduct. Definitely kicking the tires at a federal run, sources said Wednesday.
Caroline Mulroney Ontario cabinet minister. Lawyer, bilingual, 47. Politically ambitious. The eldest child of former prime minister Brian Mulroney, and the only one to make the leap into elected politics, she ran for the Ontario PC leadership before she'd even run as an MPP. After a rocky start, is finding her feet as a provincial cabinet minister. May be too soon for a successful detour into federal politics.
Doug Ford Ontario premier. Chief Etobicoke cheerleader, 57. Timing is everything, and it's not on Ford's side, this time. Several close to the premier believe he harbours a desire to be prime minister but faces a looming provincial election. Told reporters this week he has "my hands full. I love being premier of this province, we're going to build this province, and I'm going to continue leading this province." So that's a hard maybe.
Andrew Scheer Saskatchewan MP. Former Conservative leader and former Commons speaker, 42. Some of his caucus colleagues rue the day he was forced to step down after losing the 2019 election and would love to see him back. But Scheer has ruled out a comeback and wants to remain, as one supporter said, as a team player and one day serve as a cabinet minister in a Conservative government.

Ontario designing 'portable benefits' plan for workers who don't have coverage

Full text: Ontario intends to develop a "portable benefits" system for workers who don't have health, dental or vision coverage, with the package intended to move with the individuals if they change jobs.
The concept was recommended in a recent report from an expert committee tasked by the government with addressing labour disruptions from the pandemic. It's intended to cover workers in the gig economy, retail and hospitality jobs who don't have benefits, and accommodate people who may change careers throughout their lives.
"This is about rebalancing the scales and giving workers the confidence they need to drive their careers forward," Labour Minister Monte McNaughton said in an interview.
"This is how we're going to ensure that workers have more take-home pay, more workplace protections and more opportunities to build better lives."
Details about how the program will work - such as how it will be funded and who will oversee it - are going to be researched over the coming months, McNaughton said.
Workers, advocates and experts raised concerns, however, about the lack of specificity in the plan and said the government should instead focus on ensuring gig workers have basic employment standards like minimum wage.
To start, the province intends to appoint a panel of up to five people with expertise in benefits plans and financial and workplace issues to look into how best to administer the program, and how benefits will "reside with the worker," McNaughton said.
That panel will begin work in March, consulting with employers, labour leaders, workers and international experts. An interim report is expected in July - after the provincial election set for June - and the group will eventually make a final recommendation to government.
McNaughton said he wants the program to be available to people "as quickly as possible" while allowing time for complex nuances to be explored. He said the Progressive Conservative government is committed to offering benefits for workers who aren't covered, adding he thinks the plan will give Ontario a competitive advantage in attracting workers.
Most workers in Ontario who have full-time permanent jobs have health insurance and dental coverage, the province said, but less than a quarter of people who have part-time or precarious jobs have similar coverage. Those in low-wage jobs, newcomers and younger people are less likely to have workplace benefits, the province said.
The portable benefits plan was one of 21 recommendations put forward by the Ontario Workforce Recovery Advisory Committee in its final report published late last year.
The expert group also recommended that the government force greater transparency in gig work contracts and create a "dependent contractor'' category for app-based gig workers that would guarantee employment rights like severance pay and minimum wage.
McNaughton said the benefits program is his top priority for now but he wants to implement other recommendations later on.
Brice Sopher, a courier and vice-president of Gig Workers United, said his organization is still advocating for gig workers to have access to existing statutory benefits, like the Canada Pension Plan.
He said workers are concerned that the proposed portable benefits program could require that workers pay for it and see their wages drop as a result, or have some other trade-off baked in.
"We're kind of skeptical of why it has to be different," he said. "I think it's not going to work without the employment standards. I don't endorse it at all."
Sopher said he's also bothered by the timing of the announcement - with no concrete details to come until after the election - given the dire working conditions many have faced during the pandemic, like COVID-19 infections and lost income.
Jim Stanford, economist and director of the Centre for Future Work in Vancouver, said the "devil is in the details" on the portable benefits ideas, versions of which he noted already exist in some trades like construction.
But he said the idea "must be rejected" if it's aimed at replacing universal benefits like the Canada Pension Plan, employment insurance, workers' compensation and the Ontario employer health tax - some of which are federal programs. He said the government should focus on "closing loopholes," making gig companies participate in those programs and pay workers fairly.
"Why is the government moving on this issue right now? Is it to actually make sure that everyone gets health and dental? Or is it because they're being lobbied hard by Uber and other gig platforms to come up with some halfway measure that allows those businesses to pretend that they're being fair?" he said. "I'm worried about the latter."
The Opposition NDP also criticized the Progressive Conservatives for not addressing the benefits gap until after the scheduled election.
"All that was really promised today is that the (Doug) Ford government will do absolutely nothing during their term in office about the millions of Ontarians without decent health benefits," labour critic Peggy Sattler wrote in a statement.
The Ontario Federation of Labour also raised concerns that the plan would further exclude gig workers from full employment rights. President Patty Coates argued that expanding drug and dental coverage for everyone could help more.
"Where access to health care is falling short it should be improved to ensure all workers have the support they need. The answer to that challenge is the provision of universal dental care and pharmacare for every Ontarian," she said.
This report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 3, 2022.

CAPTION: Ontario Labour Minister Monte McNaughton takes to the podium during a news conference in Toronto on Wednesday April 28, 2021. Ontario wants to develop a "portable benefits" system tied to workers who don't have health, dental or vision care that will follow them if they change jobs.

Full text: Yes Doug Ford is premier, but a province is not a nation.
Why not Ford Nation - prime minister of all Canada?
Ford has never given up his dream of winning the bigger "brass ring" on Parliament Hill. Those are the words he has used in private moments to describe the one big achievement that still eludes him today.
Now, with Wednesday's defenestration of Erin O'Toole as federal Conservative leader, a window of opportunity has opened wider for that still-tempting brass ring. With the leadership up for grabs again, is Ford ready to act on his lingering political fantasy?
Surely there are many good reasons to discount this bad idea. But don't count him out just yet, not until you've answered today's question and tomorrow's thought experiment:
Who is the most powerful of all Tories in Canada today?
When Ford repurposed himself as the populist premier of the most populous province in Canada, he was quickly regarded as a rock star among his fellow travellers. When he popped up at a federal Conservative convention in 2018, delegates relegated the party's new national leader at the time, Andrew Scheer, to taking pictures of them with Ford.
Many other Ontario contenders and pretenders will be fielding phone calls today (more on that later). But all eyes are on the premier who will have his ear to the ground - and his cellphone - until the snows melt.
Would Ford be foolish enough to trade the seat of power at Queen's Park for the slippery slopes of Parliament Hill? History tells us that flirting with federal politics is something of an occupational habit for ambitious provincial leaders and an occupational hazard for a breathless media.
Then-premier Bill Davis kept reporters on the ropes for months over a rumoured federal run in the early 1980s with his mischievous flirtation, equivocation and incantation: "I have no plans to have any plans."
Even Dalton McGuinty sent up a federal Liberal leadership trial balloon when he announced his resignation as premier in late 2012. The distraction quickly fizzled, as did McGuinty.
But the current premier is a wild card, utterly unpredictable. When he lost Toronto's 2014 mayoral race, who imagined him leapfrogging to Queen's Park a few years later?
Unilingual, you say? Unimportant for many of today's Tories - let's see what they say of former Saskatchewan premier Brad Wall's lack of French.
Asked about his prospects Tuesday - back when the question of O'Toole's fate was more hypothetical than spectacle - Ford offered this homespun homily about staying close to home:
"No, I have my hands full - I love being premier of this province," he began. "That's my job. I'm just, you know, 24/7 working on getting us out of this pandemic."
And then, this little tease, intended or not: "When I see this divide in this country and in this province, I want people united and we're going to get there."
Note the notion of uniting "this country." This nation. His Ford Nation?
Spoiler alert: June 2 looms - voting day is a mere four months away, and the unofficial Ontario election campaign is already underway.
Never say never, but timing is always everything in politics. A major inhibition for his federal ambition is that Ford can't be eyeing Ottawa while neglecting Ontario.
If Ford bides his time and doesn't bite, some of his predecessors, and cabinet ministers, well might.
In which case, don't rule out the possibility of two former Ontario Progressive Conservative leaders taking a run at it: Patrick Brown and John Tory are both big city mayors who speak French - Brown with a Brampton power base, Tory straddling Fortress Toronto.
And then there's Stephen Lecce, who learned everything he knows about politics working for ex-PM Stephen Harper.
Ottawa beckons him after being bashed for years by teachers in the education portfolio.
Consider Caroline Mulroney, who has nothing if not name recognition and language cognition. She will be exhorted to follow in the footsteps of her famous father, former PM Brian Mulroney, notwithstanding her humiliating third-place defeat by Ford in 2018, and the minor matter of her media phobia.
Regardless of whether Ford or any other Ontario Tories run for the leadership - or renounce it once and for all - they will be braced for the inevitable fallout from the federal contest. The rival Conservative candidates are likely to lapse into the same old hard-right ideas that don't play well with the Ontario voters Ford needs to win re-election as premier - anti-abortion with hints of the homophobia, Islamophobia and hatred of gun control that seem to resurface in every race.
With a provincial election underway, Ontario's PCs will frequently be put on the spot and have to distance themselves with damage control. The spillover will blur and blend the federal and provincial Tory brands.
For Ford, the baggage will get heavier. And the brass ring will remain a distant dream.

Full text: The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Thursday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available.
5:05 p.m. Yukon is making tentative plans to gradually lift its COVID-19 restrictions, but the state of emergency declared in November will remain in place for another 90 days, The Canadian Press reports.
Premier Sandy Silver says starting this weekend limits on sports teams under 19 will be allowed to increase to 25 people or half the venue’s capacity, while the same rules will apply a week later to those over 19 in recreation and arts events, according to CP.
Next week, indoor personal gatherings will be allowed for up to 10 people and it will no longer be limited to two households.
The following week, Silver says Yukon plans to increase the limit on indoor organized events to half of the venue’s capacity, and will allow groups of up to six people per table at bars.
He says the government aims to allow bars and restaurants to return to normal operating hours starting March 1, no longer requiring them to close at 10 p.m.
Silver says the state of emergency may be revoked if it’s no longer needed, while the territory’s reopening plans may also be changed, based on case counts and the number of people in hospital.
5:05 p.m. Another four people have died in New Brunswick as a result of COVID-19, bring the total number of deaths in the province to 251, The Canadian Press reports.
Four other COVID-19-related deaths were reported yesterday, according to CP.
The province says 165 people are in hospital due to the disease, including 14 in intensive care.
It says 392 healthcare workers have tested positive for COVID-19 and are in isolation.
Officials are reporting 411 new COVID-19 cases today.
New Brunswick has 4,012 active reported infections.
4:13 p.m. Nova Scotia is reporting four more deaths due to COVID-19, for a total of 157 since the start of the pandemic, The Canadian Press reports.
Health officials said today the deaths involve one woman in her 60s, a woman in her 80s, and a woman and a man in their 90s, according to CP.
Officials say there are about 351 patients in hospital with COVID-19.
Chief medical officer of health, Dr. Robert Strang, says the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus continues to have devastating impacts on the province’s most vulnerable residents.
About 26 per cent of the people in hospital with COVID-19 are unvaccinated.
That percentage is close to triple the percentage of unvaccinated people in the general population.
4:13 p.m. The government has issued an order-in-council clarifying that truckers are not exempt from a vaccine mandate after bureaucrats were confused by their own policy, reports The Canadian Press.
The Canada Border Services Agency created widespread confusion last month after it issued a statement to media saying that unvaccinated truckers would remain exempt from quarantine and testing requirements after entering the country at the Canada-U.S. border, according to CP.
The federal government said the next day the statement had been sent in error, but not before some unvaccinated big-riggers had already been dispatched across the border.
The Canadian Press later revealed the confusion stemmed from bureaucrats misinterpreting policy at both the border services agency and the Public Health Agency of Canada, including whether an order-in-council, which sets out decisions made by cabinet, covered truckers or not.
The government this week issued another order-in-council to “clarify” that unvaccinated and partially vaccinated truckers are not exempt from the COVID-19 vaccine mandate when entering Canada, except if they are delivering medically necessary supplies and equipment.
The Public Health Agency said the government had extended most of its border measures and made updates to some others. It said they would be in effect until at least the end of February.
3 p.m. Dr. Kieran Moore, chief medical officer of health for Ontario, said that health indicators show a gradual improvement in the spread of COVID-19 in the province, as Ontario proceeds to reopen gradually.
The number of hospitalizations are stable, Moore said, and ICU numbers are still high, but the number of COVID-19 cases is dropping. The number of outbreaks at long-term care (LTC) homes is declining and the number of cases among residents and staff is dropping.
“We must remain vigilant and adhere to public health measures,” said Moore, who added that people should stay home if sick, wear a mask, keep a distance from others and look to get a booster shot.
Asked what learning to live with COVID-19 entails, Moore said it meant acknowledging that Omicron is highly contagious and hard to limit and so the question is how many public measures does it make sense to keep in place.
“We need to have a discussion in society about this,” said Moore, who added that countries that do not have a full suite of public health measures are also seeing a decline in cases.
Asked by a reporter if there really is a greater risk of transmission in the unvaccinated than in the doubly vaccinated, Moore said that this may not be significant, however, having three shots is of “great benefit.
“Three doses provides 95-per-cent protection against severe outcomes,” said Moore, who added that two doses does protect against severe outcomes, too, although not to the degree that three shots do.
If it seems that two doses does not work especially well against the Omicon variant, the government may reconsider its passport system. He added that passports do protect those among the unvaccinated who are most at risk.
Moore urged more Ontarians to get their third shot.
“It is so beneficial against the risk of transmissions, but especially against severe outcomes,” Moore said.
Asked what public health measures are likely to endure, Moore said masking would be the last to go. He added that, at some point, proof of vacination may be reviewed.
Moore said he hopes it becomes a community standard to get vaccinated regularly and that, perhaps, drug companies may be able to integrate the COVID-19 vaccine with other flu vaccines so people find it convenient to take them in the fall when the viruses intensify each year.
“I hope that the combination of vaccination and anti-viral (pills) will enable us to return to normality,” he said.
“We are in a much better position to be less fearful of this virus and to learn to live with it,” Moore said.
Moore said Ontario is monitoring the new BA.2 variant emerging. So far, there are 29 cases. “It is early days and we are monitoing it closely,” he said.
Asked about the amount of PCR testing being done, Moore said that it is this kind of testing is a limited resource and must be prioritized for those working in ICUs and their families. Ontario will rely on different data points to guage the level of COVID-19, he added.
1:35 p.m. It’s been a crisis long in the making. Now, as we head into the third year of a global pandemic, Ontario’s nurses are barely holding on.
Across Canada, nurses are leaving their jobs in droves, citing burnout, inadequate pay, dangerous conditions and more. With COVID cases anticipated to climb as Ontario reopens , Premier Doug Ford is set to sit down with Ontario Nurses Association (ONA) president Cathryn Hoy Thursday to discuss solutions.
“We entered the pandemic short on nurses to begin with,” Hoy told the Star Wednesday. “We have been telling the government that for years... Now, a pandemic has enhanced it.”

1:15 p.m. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was back in a New York City courtroom Thursday, more than a week after the start of a trial in her libel lawsuit against The New York Times was postponed because she tested positive for COVID-19.
After a jury was quickly selected, Palin attorney Shane Vogt told Manhattan federal court jurors in an opening statement to put aside their opinions about Palin and determine if the newspaper defamed her.
Palin will be the trial’s star witness. She’s seeking unspecified damages based on claims that an editorial in the Times hurt her budding career as a political commentator.
1 p.m. Africa’s top health official is launching a campaign to enlist young people to encourage vaccinations, as just 11.3 per cent of the continent’s 1.3 billion people are vaccinated against COVID-19.
Youths will be encouraged “to play an active role” in ramping up inoculations across the continent where the vaccination rate is far below other regions in the world, Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director John Nkengasong said Thursday.
Africa so far has 10.8 million confirmed infections and 240,000 deaths and vaccination efforts have been accelerating as vaccines doses are “becoming readily available” on the continent, Nkengasong said. In the last four weeks, Africa has seen an average 10 per cent decrease in new cases, he said.
12:40 p.m. Police and city officials are preparing for a convoy of truck drivers protesting vaccine mandates to converge upon Toronto this weekend, with Mayor John Tory vowing to do “everything we can” to avoid the disruption on display in the nation’s capital .
“I have made it clear to (Toronto police) Chief Ramer that we must work together to do everything we can to avoid the kind of situation currently faced by Ottawa residents and businesses, to keep Toronto residents safe, and to try to ensure that any protests are respectful and peaceful,” Tory told city council Thursday morning.
Toronto police issued a statement Wednesday saying the force was “aware” of and preparing for a demonstration planned Saturday in the city’s downtown core, Flyers circulating online call for supporters of the “Convoy for Freedom” to meet in designated spots throughout the GTA then head towards Queen’s Park for a midday protest.

12 p.m. Quebec is reporting 42 more deaths attributed to the coronavirus as hospitalizations related to COVID-19 again dropped.
The Health Department says there are 2,637 people in hospital, a drop of 93 compared to the previous day as 193 patients were admitted and 286 left.
Of those in hospital, 191 patients are listed in intensive care, a decline of 13 patients.
The province is reporting 3,592 new cases confirmed by PCR testing — which is limited to certain higher-risk groups — and 963 positive rapid tests declared through a provincial online platform.
11:30 a.m. Ottawa’s mayor is calling on several Conservative MPs and a senator from Saskatchewan to apologize for praising the anti-vaccine mandate protest that has brought the capital’s downtown to a standstill for close to a week.
A photo shows MPs Warren Steinley, Kevin Waugh, Andrew Scheer, Fraser Tolmie, Rosemarie Falk and Sen. Denise Batters grinning — some giving the thumbs-up — in front of one of the protest trucks, which have been barricading roads and honking horns in the city almost non-stop since Saturday.
On Twitter, Waugh said a few of Saskatchewan caucus members “went to show their appreciation for the hardworking, patriotic truckers who have kept our supply chains healthy & grocery shelves stocked for the past two years.”
11:07 a.m. Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe says his government will soon end COVID-19 measures that restrict people’s rights and freedoms.
Moe makes the comment in a four-minute video posted last night on social media.
He says it’s impossible to eliminate COVID-19, so we must learn to live with the virus while continuing to protect ourselves with vaccines, anti-viral treatments and testing.
He says that moving forward Saskatchewan will manage COVID-19 like it does with other common respiratory viruses since Omicron is less severe and people who are vaccinated can still get the virus.
10:35 a.m. NFL and SoFi Stadium officials joined with local leaders to reiterate that masks will be required for fans at the Super Bowl in Inglewood to help protect against Omicron transmission.
The mask requirement in outdoor stadiums, an order issued in L.A. County last August, was criticized as unnecessary this week by a member of the Board of Supervisors, Kathryn Barger, who represents a northern part of the county, after photos emerged of many fans maskless in their seats at Sunday’s Los Angeles Rams game.
But at a press conference Wednesday, several local elected officials backed the mask mandate, including Inglewood Mayor James T. Butts Jr. and L.A. County Supervisor Holly Mitchell, whose district includes SoFi Stadium. Guests at the Feb. 13 game will also need to show proof they’ve been vaccinated or recently tested negative for the coronavirus prior to entry, a requirement that has been in place for large outdoor events in the county since October.
10:20 a.m. Ontario is reporting 2,797 COVID hospitalizations and 541 people in ICU. Another 74 deaths were reported over the last 23 days.
83 per cent of patients admitted to the ICU were admitted for COVID-19 and 17 per cent were admitted for other reasons but have tested positive for COVID-19.
In Ontario, 30,832,550 vaccine doses have been administered. 92 per cent of Ontarians 12+ have one dose and 89.3 per cent have two doses, according to Health Minister Christine Elliott.
9:40 a.m. Palestinians are facing a winter coronavirus surge driven by the omicron variant, placing stress on the medical system even though vaccines are widely available.
The Palestinian Authority’s Health Ministry reported over 70,000 active cases in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, annexed east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip on Thursday, more than twice the number at the height of previous surges.
The real figure is likely much higher, as omicron tends to cause milder symptoms, especially in vaccinated patients, and many people are testing at home.
At least 268 people have been hospitalized in the parts of the occupied West Bank administered by the Palestinian Authority, including 80 in intensive care and 24 people on ventilators. Gaza currently has at least 63 serious cases.
8:25 a.m. Nordic combined star Jarl Magnus Riiber of Norway has tested positive for COVID-19.
The 24-year-old Riiber is No. 2 in the World Cup rankings after a three-year run of being the top-ranked athlete in the sport that combines ski jumping and cross-country skiing. He fell just short of a medal twice at the 2018 Olympics, finishing fourth in the large and normal hill competitions.
Riiber said on Instagram “the (gold) is yours guys.”
7:50 a.m. For millions of people in rich countries, COVID-19 self-tests are abundant and free, including in Britain, Canada, France and Germany. But most people across Africa have limited access to them.
Zimbabwe introduced free walk-in testing centers in November 2020, but supplies are tight and the country still has no national program to distribute at-home tests.
Although self-tests are available in some Zimbabwean pharmacies, they cost up to $15 each, a fortune in a country where more than 70% of the population lives in extreme poverty made worse by the pandemic. The situation is similar elsewhere across the continent — and in parts of Asia and Latin America — with few, if any, opportunities for people to easily test themselves.
Perhaps the biggest obstacle to making inexpensive, self-tests widely available in the developing world is that the World Health Organization has yet to issue guidance on their use. Without the resources of wealthy countries to buy tests or evaluate their safety, poor countries must wait for WHO approval before aid groups and international agencies are willing to donate them in large numbers.
7:22 a.m. Czech hockey star David Krejci tested positive for the coronavirus upon arrival in Beijing and missed the team’s first full pre-Olympic practice.
Coach Filip Pesan says Krejci is still in the athletes village awaiting more COVID-19 test results. Pesan voiced optimism about Krejci being cleared Friday after a similar situation unfolded with another player.
The 35-year-old longtime Boston Bruins center is expected to be among the best players in the tournament without NHL players. Krejci won the Stanley Cup with Boston in 2011 and has 854 points in 1,118 regular-season and playoff games.
6:05 a.m. Rufsa Hasina Afroze, a teacher and academic supervisor at a leading private school in Bangladesh’s capital was relieved to see students return to its campus in September after it was closed for 543 days because of the pandemic.
It was only a brief respite from online learning. With the recent surge in coronavirus cases mostly because of the omicron variant, authorities have ordered the schools to close once more.
“It was not the same campus, but still we were happy to return,” she said. “During the whole period I missed my students and colleagues. It was a big challenge for me to adjust to the new reality.“
The closure initially was just for two weeks, until Feb. 6. But on Wednesday Education Minister Dipu Moni announced it was to be extended for another two weeks.

5:45 a.m. City of Toronto staff anticipated that a scaled-back version of the mayor’s transit plan unveiled last year could be criticized as an unwise use of money during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to internal emails.
The documents, which the Star obtained through a freedom of information request, show bureaucrats wanted to be able to address concerns that the $1.46 billion required for Mayor John Tory’s updated SmartTrack proposal would be better spent on other transit priorities, particularly in light of the economic challenges and social inequality Toronto was confronting during the coronavirus crisis.
Experts say those concerns were well-founded, and other transit projects that have taken a back seat to the mayor’s plan would better serve marginalized Torontonians hardest hit by COVID-19.

5:40 a.m. Germany’s independent vaccination advisory panel said Thursday it is recommending a second vaccine booster shot for people aged 70 and above, among others particularly at risk from COVID-19.
In a draft recommendation, the panel also advocated the extra shot for residents of nursing homes, people with immunodeficiency aged 5 and above, and staff at medical and nursing care facilities.
It said that the at-risk groups should get the second booster three months at the earliest after the first, and health sector staff should receive it after six months. It pointed to data showing that the protection provided by the first booster against the now-dominant omicron variant wanes after a few months, particularly for the highest-risk groups.
5:35 a.m. Trustees with the Toronto District School Board approved a motion to provide medical masks for all students Wednesday evening.
Level 3 medical grade masks will be made available to all TDSB students, the board said in a statement.
Students are allowed to continue to wear their own mask, but one optional medical mask per day will be available to all students until the end of the school year.
The cost of the project will range from $444,000 to $2 million, depending on the number of masks used by students. It will be paid for by TDSB’s reserve funds.

5:30 a.m. Sweden on Thursday joined other European nations in saying it will remove coronavirus restrictions.
“It is time to open Sweden again,” said Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson, announcing the restrictions would be removed from Wednesday next week.
Among the measures and recommendations that will be lifted, Sweden will allow people to return to restaurants with no limitation on how many people can be there, how much space there should be or opening hours. Requirements for vaccine certificates and wearing face masks on public transportation will also be removed, as well as the recommendation to limit social contacts.
On Tuesday, neighboring Denmark took the lead among European Union members by scrapping most restrictions. Hours later, Norway lifted its ban on serving alcohol after 11 p.m. and the cap on private gatherings of no more than 10 people.
5:20 a.m. Ontario’s top doctor is set to hold a news conference on the pandemic later today, his first since public health restrictions began to ease this week.
Dr. Kieran Moore’s afternoon briefing comes after modelling from the province’s expert pandemic advisers predicted COVID-19 cases would rise after Monday’s partial reopening.
The Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table said relaxing public health measures aimed at controlling the Omicron variant would increase virus spread, but the experts couldn’t say by how much.
The group said outcomes will depend partly on how many people have recently been infected, a number that is hard to determine because the province has limited access to PCR tests.
5:15 a.m. Ottawa’s mayor is calling on several Conservatives MPs and a senator from Saskatchewan to apologize for praising the anti-vaccine mandate protest that has brought the capital’s downtown to a standstill for close to a week.
A photo shows MPs Warren Steinley, Kevin Waugh, Andrew Scheer, Fraser Tolmie, Rosemarie Falk and Sen. Denise Batters grinning — some giving the thumbs-up — in front of one of the protest trucks, which have been barricading roads and honking horns in the city almost non-stop since Saturday.
On Twitter, Waugh said a few of Saskatchewan caucus members “went to show their appreciation for the hardworking, patriotic truckers who have kept our supply chains healthy & grocery shelves stocked for the past two years.” He added, “it’s great to see Canadians championing freedom on Parliament Hill.”
Mayor Jim Watson responded on Twitter by calling the action an “absolute disgrace,” saying residents have been harassed by protesters and businesses have been forced to close.
5 a.m. Health officials are warning the drop in COVID-related hospitalizations in some provinces could come to an end as public health restrictions are loosened.
Ontario’s top doctor is to hold a news conference later today, his first since restrictions began to ease this week and follows modelling from the Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table that predicts a rise in cases in the coming weeks.
Ontario and Quebec are allowing indoor restaurant dining at 50 per cent capacity.
Manitoba’s chief public health officer said yesterday that data shows the province may have passed the peak of the Omicron-fuelled surge and restrictions on gathering sizes and people allowed at sports events will be relaxed beginning on Tuesday.
Alberta and Saskatchewan reported record numbers of people in hospital with COVID-19 this week as both provinces announced they hope to remove vaccine passport requirements by the end of the month.
4:55 a.m . Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is self-isolating after being exposed last weekend to a member of his household staff who had COVID-19, but Duterte has twice tested negative following the exposure, his spokesman said Thursday.
The 76-year-old leader continues to work while in quarantine and remains in communication with his Cabinet members to address urgent issues and pandemic-related concerns, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said.
Duterte has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and received his booster shot last month.
4:45 a.m. One lane each way has been cleared on the highway at the main United States border crossing in southern Alberta but a new problem began late Wednesday night.
Many of the original protesters still remain in Coutts but moved their trucks over to the right side of the highway after an agreement on a partial pull back was reached earlier in the day.
But the expected stream of trucks heading toward the U.S. border didn’t materialize.
Another blockade had set up 18 kilometres to the north near Milk River. A long line of RCMP vehicles, with their lights flashing, blocked off the highway as hundreds of vehicles continued to gather on both sides of the highway with their horns blaring.
“The RCMP have made some progress to re-open Hwy 4 from Milk River to the border. Currently travel is impeded at the north part of Hwy 4 where motorists can expect an RCMP escort to the border,” the Alberta RCMP said in a tweet.
4:30 a.m. Long before the global pandemic upended sports and the world in general, the 2022 Winter Olympics faced unsettling problems.
It started with the fact that hardly anybody wanted to host them.
Beijing ended up solving that problem, but only after four European cities thought about it and dropped out, mostly because of expense and lack of public support. In the end, it was a race between two authoritarian countries. The IOC narrowly chose China’s capital and its mostly bone-dry surrounding mountains over a bid from Kazakhstan. “It really is a safe choice,” IOC President Thomas Bach said after the balloting.
Some seven years after that fateful vote, the world will find out if Bach was right. Starting with Friday’s opening ceremony at the lattice-ribboned Bird’s Nest Stadium, the spotlight will be trained on China, a country with human-rights record that troubles many, an authoritarian government and a “zero-tolerance” policy when it comes to COVID. It will be trained on what figures to be the most closed-off, tightly controlled, hard-to-navigate Olympics in history.
The build-up has turned the idea of “making it to the Games” into as much of a logistical and sometimes moral conundrum as a competitive one.

Full text: Ontario has granted fewer than 300 medical exemptions from COVID-19 vaccinations a month into a new system that requires them to be verified by local health units - a measure intended to cut down on fraud.
Now integrated into QR codes used under the proof-of-vaccination system to get into gyms, cinemas, sporting events, restaurants, bars, concert halls and other venues, the exemptions replace the previous regime in which patrons could show an exemption letter from a doctor to gain entry.
There were 290 medical exemptions registered in the provincial COVax computer system as of Monday's reopening, according to government figures provided to the Star.
Ontario's population is approximately 14.7 million.
The relatively low number suggests the new system is working in the wake of concerns from chief medical officer Dr. Kieran Moore that no more than five in 100,000 Ontarians have specific and rare medical conditions that medically qualify them for vaccination exemptions, officials said.
"We're very pleased that given the limited number of valid medical exemptions issued to date, the process is working and individuals with legitimate medical exemptions are able to be accommodated," said Alexandra Hilkene, a spokesperson for Health Minister Christine Elliott.
Critics complained the old system of presenting doctor's letters was ripe for abuse and forgeries. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario is investigating more than 40 doctors for COVID-19-related issues, which include potentially bogus exemptions.
One government source told the Star last fall that "we've seen the same doctors giving out exemptions to everyone who asks."
It's not known how many potentially invalid exemption letters were circulating.
Health units in Ontario have granted another 234 exemptions to citizens participating in vaccine trials.
Concerns about exemptions were amplified in the fall when two of Premier Doug Ford's then-70 MPPs claimed them - a statistical anomaly.
Lindsey Park (Durham) and Christina Mitas of (Scarborough Centre) have announced they will not run in the June 2 election. Park quit the Progressive Conservative caucus last fall, leaving Mitas as the lone unvaccinated Tory MPP after the premier required all his members to be vaccinated unless they had a valid exemption.
Toronto Public Health said it has received 79 exemption requests from qualified medical practitioners and confirmed 58 of them. Eight were denied, and doctors or nurse practitioners who submitted another 13 have been asked for more detail " due to incomplete information in the initial submission."
"Designated Toronto Public Health staff reviews each request to ensure the practitioner is qualified to make a submission according to the province's criteria and that the information provided on the submission template complies with those criteria," the health unit added in a statement.
In neighbouring Peel, medical professionals can submit exemption applications to a secure online portal launched last week.
To date, two exemptions have been requested and both were granted, Peel Public Health told the Star on Tuesday.
York Region Public Health reported 22 exemption requests with 20 approved, a rate of 1.8 per 100,000 residents - well below the statistical threshold set by Moore.
"Individuals without a clinic assessment from an Ontario health care professional will not be considered medical exempt from receiving the COVID-19 vaccine," said York Region spokesperson Melissa Pinto.
The Durham Region public health unit has received 11 exemption requests. Nine were granted and two remain under review.
Halton region did not provide information.

Full text: No, the New Democratic Party is not a party of Nazi lovers.
But until today, it was a safe space for a Nazi honourer.
Belatedly, Ontario’s NDP announced Monday that former Ajax mayor Steve Parish would no longer be on the ballot in the June 2 election.
The high-profile politician was dogged by controversy after his relentless campaign to commemorate German naval commander Hans Langsdorff by naming a street after this “remarkable leader” in a 2007 ceremony as mayor . He came out of retirement in 2020 to oppose any removal of the name, and stuck to his guns in 2022 while campaigning as a New Democrat.
Through it all, NDP Leader Andrea Horwath stood by her star candidate . No New Democrat left behind — even if supporters and party members were abandoning Horwath in the aftermath.
The public response to my Saturday column , and from people in the party, appears to have given Horwath pause. The column deconstructed Parish’s bizarre obsession with Langsdorff Ave., and alerted more people to the little-known story of how he sullied Ajax with a street name.
“I have decided that Steve Parish cannot be a candidate for the NDP,” Horwath declared late Monday. “The NDP’s vetting process gave us confidence that Mr. Parish does not hold antisemitic views. However, our party is committed to naming and correcting injustice, and vowing to do better — and as a candidate he has not met the mark.”
Parish — who boasted that he was recruited by the party — dug himself in even deeper a few days ago by issuing a phoney apology acknowledging merely that he “caused pain to some people in the Jewish community.” As if only Jews might be hurt or scandalized by commemorating a Nazi fighter.
Turns out he was wrong about that. Some of his strongest opponents were the racialized non-Jews — newly-elected councillors — who in 2020 overruled him by rescinding the Langsdorff street name.
The bigger problem with his grudging apology? It was utterly performative and political — conceding nothing while concealing what Parish truly thinks of honouring a military man who pledged loyalty to Adolf Hitler as a “prophet.”
Nowhere did Parish acknowledge the folly and the offence of affixing a Nazi’s name on a street sign where people go about their lives — as opposed to perhaps a plaque in a dusty military museum exhibit, or an online history text for lovers of naval warfare marvelling at the apparent professionalism of this captain. And yes, I have read the letters and tweets from those who ardently defend Langsdorff for merely doing his duty to fatherland — and Führer — as if that somehow merits commemoration in a Toronto bedroom community.
Yet Horwath at first pronounced herself fully satisfied with his hollow words. Even with International Holocaust Remembrance Day looming, she initially echoed Parish’s misplaced assertion that only Jews might be offended by honouring a Nazi.
“Steve Parish has apologized unreservedly and acknowledged the pain it caused for Jewish Ontarians,” she said at the time, noting approvingly that it was “without equivocation.”
Some New Democrats saw what their leader overlooked and pointed out the hypocrisy. Other New Democrats gave up on the party entirely.
“You equivocate when it comes to Mr. Parish’s support for renaming a street after a Nazi naval commander,” wrote Leslie Wolfe, a longtime teacher’s union activist who announced on social media that she was cancelling her NDP membership in Toronto’s St. Paul’s riding.
“Andrea Horwath’s statement of Support for Mr. Parish’s candidacy, while also stating support for the Jewish community and against Jew-hatred, is simply the party speaking out of both sides of its mouth.”
That is precisely what Parish did every step of the way. To watch his performance at the 2020 meeting where he adamantly defended his legacy on Langsdorff is to see a politician who prefers preaching to pausing and listening.
Never mind the impassioned presentations by two Jews at the Ajax council meeting that day — rabbi Tzali Borenstein, and Holocaust survivor and educator Max Eisen, both of whose families perished in Hitler’s gas chambers. They and others were well-meaning but merely misinformed about history, Parish countered in a perfectly patronizing tone.
After a weekend of reflection and resignations, Horwath herself had second thoughts.
“Mr. Parish has not denounced the decision to have a street named after a high-ranking German officer in the Second World War,” she declared in Monday’s statement.
“Perhaps most importantly he has not demonstrated that he understands why that is harmful. I want to thank the grassroots New Democrats, community members and Jewish leaders who took time to meet with me to discuss this issue.”
Parish is not ignorant of history and he is no Holocaust denier, for he publicly acknowledged the deaths of six million Jews. But his is a blinkered view of the cold reality of history.
It’s not that he is antisemitic, merely unempathetic .
As a commander, Langsdorff “was carrying out his duty,” Parish lectured the newly elected councillors two years ago. “Council will want to do what’s right ... people should not be slurred,” he demurred.
“Ajax has always, I’m proud to say — and continues to be — a leader with respect to diversity,” he boasted.
Ah, diversity. Regional (and racialized) councillor Sterling Lee had a question:
“How many racialized or representative groups that were affected by the Holocaust were in those decisions ... synagogues, the Polish community, the Roma, anything like that, the homosexual community?” Lee asked.
“I’m not sure I’d recollect that,” Parish replied.
Diversity is normally a big deal for putative progressives. It seems odd that Parish was stumped by the question.
The town’s newly-hired diversity and inclusion co-ordinator, Natasha Sharma, was asked for her own analysis:
“Through my diversity and inclusion lens, I do think that naming a street after a commander and captain of a German warship is problematic,” Sharma told council, noting she had dug into the town’s archives to get the full story of Langsdorff’s history — and the larger reality.
“The lives of millions of people from the Jewish community were taken,” she continued. “That is more painful to the Jewish community, who is still in healing and mourning for the atrocities that have been experienced.”
On the sidelines of the Zoom meeting, Parish was listening quietly — without quite listening up. Two years later, Horwath’s NDP has now heard the message loud and clear.

Justin Trudeau and Erin O'Toole scrap over who's to blame for 'Freedom Convoy' protest

Full text: OTTAWA — The political tension around protests on Parliament Hill thickened Monday as the Liberals and Conservatives denounced each other’s responses to the demonstrations, even as the anti-vaccination mandate crowd began to thin.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau suggested those opposed to COVID-19 vaccination mandates who flocked to Parliament Hill over the weekend have fallen prey to conspiracy theories about “microchips, about God knows what else that go with tinfoil hats.”
And acts of hate that occurred during the protest — like waving Nazi flags and the desecrating of the National War Memorial — should give politicians like Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole pause before they cast their lot with the demonstrators, Trudeau said.
“I think Erin O’Toole is going to need to reflect very carefully on how he’s walking a path that supports these people who do not represent truckers, let alone the vast majority of Canadians,” Trudeau told a news conference Monday.
The “Freedom Convoy” protest was spurred by a requirement for commercial truckers to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to drive across the Canada-U.S. border. The U.S. imposed a similar rule. Thousands of protesters converged on Ottawa to protest the vaccination mandates.
While the Canadian Trucking Alliances said the vast majority of truckers are vaccinated, the demonstration also drew people from outside the industry who voiced concerns and frustrations with ongoing pandemic restrictions. Those are the people the Conservatives have said they are supporting, and O’Toole met with a handful of truckers on their way into Ottawa on Friday.
Over the course of the weekend, some protesters refused to wear masks inside shopping malls and harassed staff, leading to widespread business closures downtown. Workers at a homeless shelter were threatened, protesters danced on the National War Monument, and Nazi flags and other racist images were displayed in the crowd.
On Monday, O’Toole denounced those behind what he called the “handful of unacceptable incidents.”
What is driving the protests are anger and fear, he told a Facebook Live event, which are the product of the politics Trudeau was playing with by campaigning on vaccination mandates last year.
“We as a country need to ask ourselves, how did we end up with division and vaccine politics that look more like America’s than anywhere else? How did Canada, a country that has always prized dialogue, discussion, moderation, end up with this anger and spite in our politics?” O’Toole asked.
“The prime minister must ask himself. Yes, he won, but at what cost?”
Trudeau announced Monday that he had tested positive for COVID-19, a diagnosis that came after one of his children tested positive last week.
He will remain in isolation for at least five days, but said his government won’t be cowed by the display on the streets, nor will it meet with the protesters, calling them an affront to those who have done “the right thing” and been vaccinated to help end the pandemic.
“Canadians know where I stand,” he said. “This is a moment for responsible leaders to think carefully about where they stand and who they stand with.”
The fight over the protests dominated much of the year’s first question period in the House of Commons, and Liberal House Leader Mark Holland’s plea for all sides to tone it down was met with jeers from across the aisle.
The lone olive branch extend by the Tories to the Liberals was a wish for Trudeau’s speedy recovery, and O’Toole’s acknowledgment that his own family has had COVID-19.
O’Toole’s diagnosis came just as he was set to take his seat in the Commons in the fall of 2020 as the newly elected party leader, an inauspicious beginning to what’s been a challenging 18 months in the job.
Amid calls to step down and direct challenges from his MPs, O’Toole’s defence of the truckers and meeting with them capped a particularly difficult few weeks, which included a presentation to caucus on the party’s failure to win last year’s election.
Among the report’s conclusions was that O’Toole failed to be authentic and take definitive positions on issues that were important to voters, something he alluded to in his remarks Monday.
Polls suggest a shift is underway on how Canadians view COVID-19 restrictions.
An Angus Reid survey released Monday found that 54 per cent say its time to remove restrictions, an increase of 15 percentage points since the question was asked last earlier in January.
The survey found that among those who voted Conservative in the last election, 81 per cent agreed or strongly agreed it is time for restrictions to lift, while only 34 per cent of Liberals felt the same way.
The online survey of 1,688 Canadians was conducted on Jan. 27 and 28. Online polls aren’t considered random but are less reliable than traditional polling methods.

O'Toole struggles for survival ahead of vote

Full text: Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole and his team worked furiously to salvage his leadership Tuesday, on the eve of a crucial caucus vote that some party insiders predicted he has little chance of surviving.
Conservative MPs are set to vote Wednesday on whether O'Toole ought to stay on as leader. If a majority of them don't agree that he should, he'll be shown the door.
O'Toole and some of his closest allies were working the phones Tuesday, trying to gauge whether that majority exists. But sources told the Star that his team was reaching out in some cases to MPs who have already signed on to the effort to dump him.
"He doesn't have the support he thinks he does," said one MP, speaking on the condition they not be named, in order to freely discuss internal party matters.
Thirty-five Tory MPs are squarely in favour of ousting O'Toole, having signed a letter calling for a vote on whether he should remain as leader.
That effort began immediately after the Conservatives failed to beat the Liberals in the 2021 election, and has gained momentum in fits and starts as the party has struggled to make gains in popular support.
Things came to a head last week, when Conservative MPs heard the results of the party's election review. During a heated meeting, some caucus members openly challenged O'Toole in a way that left many with the impression his days were numbered.
When news of the effort to remove him broke Monday, O'Toole's response painted his critics as wanting to take the party down an angry and negative path, one that he characterized as a political dead end. He returned to that theme Tuesday during calls with his MPs, several told the Star, and promised new approaches on policy.
But trying to characterize his opponents as belonging to specific wings of the party - he cited those opposed to vaccination among them - just made him new enemies, several Tory MPs said.
"He's doing exactly what he criticizes Justin Trudeau for doing - dividing people, and pitting them against each other," one MP said.
That in turn is uniting O'Toole's critics against him, another MP said, because there is a common thread that links his detractors: broken trust.
"There is no policy idea he could put forward that would fix any of this," the MP said.
The process for a leadership review is enshrined in the Reform Act, legislation designed to give MPs more power over how their caucus runs.
To trigger a leadership review, a written notice signed by at least 20 per cent of the party's caucus is sent to the chair. With 35 of the caucus's 119 members having signed the letter, that threshold has been met.
A vote by secret ballot will be held electronically during a caucus meeting Wednesday on Zoom.
O'Toole only needs a simple majority of votes in his favour to claim the support of his caucus. However, as one MP put it to the Star on Tuesday, "even if he gets it, he doesn't really have it," given that 35 MPs have already moved against him.
If the MPs vote to replace O'Toole, a vote to choose an interim leader will be held later Wednesday evening. Names already in the mix Tuesday were deputy leader Candice Bergen, Quebec MP Gerard Deltell and former Tory cabinet minister Ed Fast.
Bergen was among the handful of Conservative MPs who voiced support for O'Toole on Tuesday.
"I want Erin O'Toole to remain as leader," she told reporters.
While grassroots efforts to turf O'Toole have sprung up since the election, one in support of his continued leadership was relaunched on Tuesday.
Fraser Macdonald, a former Conservative campaign manager in Pickering-Uxbridge, is one of the organizers of the Majority Committee, which he said is meant to encourage a silent majority of Tories who support O'Toole's approach to come forward. He said their perspectives are never voiced as loudly as those who feel the party needs to tack farther right, and it's time for a change.
Macdonald launched a petition after the 2021 election to encourage O'Toole to stay on, an effort that O'Toole seized upon as proof that he still had the support of party members. Macdonald said Tuesday afternoon that he hadn't been in contact with O'Toole's team.
Several former Tory candidates, including some in the Greater Toronto Area, voiced support for O'Toole on Tuesday, as did Alberta MP Tim Uppal and Nova Scotia MP Chris D'Entremont.
Finance critic Pierre Poilievre, who had contemplated a run for leadership in the 2020 race that O'Toole ultimately won, did not return a request for comment Tuesday. Poilievre's name tops the lists of many party insiders as the person who may make a bid if a leadership contest is called.
Another potential contender has already turned down the job. Premier Doug Ford said Tuesday he has no interest in pursuing the federal leadership.
"I have my hands full. I love being premier of this province. We're going to build this province, and I'm going to continue leading this province," said Ford, whose Progressive Conservative government is up for re-election on June 2.

Full text: The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Wednesday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available .
2:40 p.m. Ottawa officials held a virtual press conference to address the ongoing disruption by the trucker convoy in the nation’s capital.
Peter Sloly, chief of the Ottawa Police Service, says the demonstration “has been intolerable.”
“The range of illegal, dangerous and unacceptable activities is beyond the ability to list in the time that we have here today,” Sloly said during the news conference Wednesday afternoon, adding “residents have been the victims of intense noise, threatening behaviour, hateful vitriol that has no place in our city, or anywhere in our country.”
Sloly went on to say that his officers have been pushed to the limit, have been injured and fatigued during the convoy’s time in the city. He addressed the demonstrators directly
There are consequences for your behaviour. There have been arrests made, there have been charges laid, there are more coming, they’ll be announced even today,” Sloly said.
“It does not matter how long it takes, we will find those who committed the criminal acts, we will lay charges against them, and they will face the possibility of jail as a result of it.”
2:03 p.m. The Manitoba government is relaxing some of its COVID-19 restrictions starting Tuesday.
Chief public health officer, Dr. Brent Roussin, says indicators such as hospital admissions suggest the current pandemic wave is at its peak.
There will be a larger cap on gatherings in private homes, and alcohol sales at licensed premises will be extended until midnight from 10 p.m.
Casinos, museums, restaurants and professional sporting events will still be limited to half capacity, but will no longer be capped at a maximum of 250 people.
Hospital usage remains high, with 110 people in intensive care, including non-COVID patients.
The province is reporting seven additional COVID-related deaths.
2 p.m. Ontario's official COVID-19 testing volumes have plummeted since PCR access was sharply restricted in the face of an Omicron surge, but rather than widely re-expanding eligibility in the future, the province appears to be forging a new pandemic testing path.
Demand for tests at the end of last year saw a high of more than 75,000 processed the day the government announced eligibility would be limited largely to high-risk individuals - including patients in hospital, residents and staff in long-term care, and people being considered for COVID-19 treatments.
There have been calls to allow more residents to access gold-standard PCR tests, including students and staff in schools and child-care settings, now that an average of 25,460 tests have been processed each day over the past week, including a low of 15,008 one day on the weekend.
2 p.m. Newfoundland and Labrador health officials say seven people in the province died of COVID-19 in long-term care facilities or in personal care homes between Dec. 20 and Jan. 28.
That number represents 35 per cent of the 20 people who died in the province during that period.
A Health Department spokeswoman says those seven deaths are the first in the province to occur in these facilities since the pandemic began.
Newfoundland and Labrador does not regularly report COVID-19 deaths or infections in long-term care centres, unlike Quebec or Ontario.
The province is reporting four more COVID-19 deaths today, bringing the provincial total to 44.
1:40 p.m. Tensions are rising at the U.S. border crossing near Coutts, Alta., as a blockade enters its fifth day, with protesters snarling traffic and bucking police demands.
Alberta RCMP officers had attempted to clear the logjam of trucks on Tuesday, saying the blockaders were breaking the law by blocking critical infrastructure, but their efforts ultimately failed.
The blockade has been in place since Saturday on the north side of the crossing between Alberta and Montana to protest vaccination mandates put in place this month for truck drivers going across the Canada-U.S. border.
Its drawn condemnation from politicians across the country and brought cross-border traffic to a standstill, while causing headaches for nearby residents.

1:25 p.m. Prince Edward Island is reporting 238 new cases of COVID-19. They say there are 15 people in hospital because of the disease, unchanged since Tuesday.
Chief public health officer Dr. Heather Morrison says there are two people in intensive care. She says there are another eight patients in hospital who were admitted for other reasons and have tested positive for COVID-19. The Island has 2,253 active reported infections.
Officials say they are monitoring multiple outbreaks at long-term care facilities and in early learning and childcare centres.
1:05 p.m. Ottawa police face mounting pressure to take stronger action against the protest of COVID-19 measures that has taken over the capital city, while organizers threaten to stay "as long as it takes" for governments across the country to end pandemic restrictions.
Although politicians do not direct the police, local elected officials say officers need to do more to move the protesters and their big trucks off city streets.
"I'm happy no cars have been burning on the streets and no windows are smashed in and we haven't had any fatalities, but we have hit a boiling point in the city," said Coun. Tim Tierney, who chairs a committee responsible for Ottawa's roadways.
"We're hearing loud and clear from our constituencies and we want to see some kind of action."
12:45 p.m. The Canadian Medical Association and a group of domestic and international activists are calling on the federal government to do more to boost COVID-19 vaccination efforts in less developed countries in order to end the pandemic.
Raising the international vaccination rate in less prosperous countries is the only way to prevent the emergence of new COVID-19 variants that are prolonging the pandemic through an endless cycle of lockdowns and serious illness, said Dr. Katharine Smart, the president of the leading association of Canadian medical professionals.
"Without taking this perspective, we will continue to find ourselves in a perpetual cycle of pandemic management, with new variants and mutations developing in countries where vaccine rates remain low," Smart said Wednesday.
12:30 p.m. The Canadian team's head doctor in Beijing says COVID-19 preventions before and upon athletes' arrivals has kept the virus mostly at bay so far.
One asymptomatic non-athlete in Canada's delegation of about 450 was in isolation Wednesday two days before the opening ceremonies, which was down from five personnel in protocol last week.
"Our goal … is to enable the athletes and the teams to get to the starting line safely, and to try and enable every athlete that is here in Beijing to be able to compete through all these protocols," Dr. Mike Wilkinson said Wednesday at the Canadian Olympic Committee's opening news conference.
12 p.m. The Quebec government is reporting another big drop in the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 Wednesday, as well as 50 new deaths linked to the pandemic.
The Health Department said today that COVID-19 related hospitalizations dropped by 122, to 2,730, after 328 people left hospital and 206 were admitted.
The number of people in intensive care dropped by 14 to 204.
Health officials say 3,816 new cases were confirmed by PCR testing and another 1,000 positives from take-home rapid tests were declared via the province's online platform.
Health workers also gave 49,444 vaccine doses in the past 24 hours.
11:30 a.m. The trial of three former Minneapolis police officers charged with violating George Floyd’s rights was abruptly recessed on Wednesday after one of the defendants tested positive for COVID-19.
Judge Paul Magnuson says the court is in recess until Monday. The officer who tested positive wasn’t named by the court.
11:10 a.m. A Montreal lawyer is in court Wednesday contesting a COVID-19 health order that prevents unvaccinated people from entering long-term care homes and private seniors homes to care for residents.
The provincial government issued a decree in December tightening rules in care settings, including by imposing an order that requires caregivers to show proof of vaccination before they can enter facilities.
Lawyer Natalia Manole says the government should revert to the previous rule, which required caregivers to present negative results from tests taken within the previous 72 hours.
She says if health-care workers who are unvaccinated are able to work under those conditions, she doesn't see why caregivers shouldn't be afforded the same right.
10:30 a.m. Ottawa police say they have arrested two men after investigations related to protest against public health restrictions in the capital city, while organizers of the convoy are threatening to stay "for as long as it takes" for governments across the country to end COVID-19 vaccine mandates.
Police say 37-year-old Andre Lacasse was charged on Sunday with carrying a weapon to a public meeting, while 29-year-old Matthew Dorken was charged Tuesday with mischief under $5,000.
10:18 a.m. (updated) Ontario is reporting 2,939 people in the hospital with COVID-19 and 555 people in intensive care.
That's down from 3,091 hospitalized patients and 568 people in ICU on Tuesday.
The province is also reporting 67 more deaths from the virus.
There were 3,909 new COVID-19 cases though Public Health Ontario has said the true number is likely higher due to testing policy changes.
The province isn't reporting data on virus cases and outbreaks in schools but seven schools were reported closed for operational reasons.
10:05 a.m. Europe is accelerating steps to roll back coronavirus restrictions as efforts to control the fast-spreading Omicron variant have been largely futile.
Under pressure from a pandemic-weary public, politicians across the region are deeming many public-health measures increasingly unnecessary. Italy, Switzerland and Finland are set to join Denmark, Ireland and France in easing the bulk of restrictions on public life. Norway also relaxed most rules.
While the virus continues to spread rapidly across the continent — with more than 2.4 million cases over the past two days — the alert level has dropped. Health care systems are proving resilient because omicron causes milder symptoms and most people are protected by vaccines.
9:35 a.m. Keegan Messing's Olympic Games are in jeopardy. The 30-year-old isn't with Canada's figure skating team at the Beijing Olympics, as he waits to clear COVID-19 testing to travel.
The delay means Messing, who captured his first Canadian title last month, won't be in Beijing in time for the team event, which begins with the short programs on Friday. The Canadian Olympic Committee hopes he'll get the green light in time to skate in the men's singles competition, which begins with the short programs on Tuesday.
9:20 a.m. COVID-19 hospitalizations are predicted to rise at a time when Hamilton’s hospitals are already so strained they are transferring patients out.
Hamilton Health Sciences (HHS) reported severe overcrowding for a second day on Tuesday, with occupancy at 129 per cent at Juravinski Hospital and 111 per cent at Hamilton General Hospital.
All funded beds are full when occupancy is at 100 per cent. Anything over occupancy is unfunded beds — sometimes in unconventional spaces like hallways.
The intensive care unit (ICU) at the Charlton Campus of St. Joseph’s Healthcare was also overflowing at 104 per cent occupancy.
9:05 a.m. RCMP say more officers have been called in to help with an illegal blockade at a United States border crossing in southern Alberta, now in its fifth day .
Mounties were prepared to make arrests Tuesday at the Coutts crossing but backed off when there were safety concerns.
Some of those involved in the blockade are protesting mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations for cross-border truck drivers as well as broader public health measures.
Premier Jason Kenney says he also opposes the vaccine mandate for truckers, but protesters should find a lawful way to make their point.
8:45 a.m. A COVID-19 draft law defeated in Poland's parliament has exposed deep divisions inside the ruling right-wing coalition and a weakening of the country's most powerful politician, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, analysts said on Wednesday.
Some 61 lawmakers of the so-called United Right ruling team led by Kaczynski’s Law and Justice Party abstained or voted against the law in the 460-seat lower house late Tuesday. Another 15 of the ruling coalition's 228 lawmakers didn't even show up for the vote. Analysts said the result marked an unprecedented high degree of dissent within the ruling coalition and poses a challenge to Kaczynski's leadership.
The vote indicates that “the United Right does not exist as such any more," political analyst Barbara Brodzińska-Mirowska from Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun told private TVN24. “The rifts are really deep and the games and interests are very much advanced, and things will not get better."
8:15 a.m. The Toronto-raised star of "Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings" will take the reins as host of this year's televised celebration of Canadian music May 15.
It's another high-profile hosting gig for the "Kim's Convenience" alum who presided over an episode of "Saturday Night Live" for the first time last November.
The Junos will be historic in their own way since it's the first time the awards show will be held outdoors.
7:18 a.m. On Ontario’s first days of reopening, dozens of moviegoers around Toronto rushed to sit in a theatre again, nibbling on buttered popcorn and snacks as they caught the latest Spider-Man film.
Others took the opportunity to revisit the gym after a month-long hiatus, or to take their toddlers to see the famed jellyfish at Ripley’s Aquarium.
“You really get the sense that there’s a mood right now where people want to be in that snap-back stage,” said Steve Joordens, a University of Toronto psychology professor, as he reflected on the lifting of restrictions.

6:40 a.m. Beijing reported three new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday as officials said the virus situation was under control with the Olympic Games set to open later in the week.
The three cases reported in the 24-hour period from Tuesday to Wednesday all involved people under some sort of quarantine.
“The current pandemic situation in the capital is overall controllable and it's headed in a good direction,” said Xu Hejian, a spokesman for the city government, at a daily press briefing. “Beijing is safe.”
The Chinese capital has been on high-alert as it prepares to host the Winter Olympics starting Friday.
6:37 a.m. Toronto’s St. Patrick’s Parade will return this year, depending on the continued Ontario government’s reopening plan, according to the a news release.
St. Patrick’s Parade was among the first to cancel its event when the pandemic arrived in early 2020. The parade was cancelled again in 2021.
The event is set to take place on Sunday, March 20.
6:05 a.m. RCMP say more officers have been called in to help with an illegal blockade at a United States border crossing in southern Alberta, now in its fifth day.
Mounties were prepared to make arrests Tuesday at the Coutts crossing but backed off when there were safety concerns.
Cpl. Curtis Peters says some vehicles left peacefully but others, including tractors, sped through police roadblocks to join the blockade.
He says there was a head-on crash and a person involved then assaulted another person.
Peters also says some protesters have harassed the local mayor and his wife by showing up at their home and taking photos through their windows.
5:45 a.m. 5:38 a.m. Just one member of the Canadian team in Beijing was in COVID-19 protocols on Wednesday, down from three members a day earlier.
The 414-member Canadian delegation includes athletes, coaches and team staff.
The individual is in protocols that "impact their ability to fulfil their role at Games," the Canadian Olympic Committee said in a statement.
"We are managing each one on a case-by-case basis and to respect the privacy of the people involved we will not be sharing names at this time," the COC's statement said. "Part of our strategy was to arrive early to allow time for confirmation testing and, if necessary, the Medical Expert Panel process to unfold."
5:35 a.m. On Ontario’s first days of reopening, dozens of moviegoers around Toronto rushed to sit in a theatre again, nibbling on buttered popcorn and snacks as they caught the latest Spider-Man film.
Others took the opportunity to revisit the gym after a month-long hiatus, or to take their toddlers to see the famed jellyfish at Ripley’s Aquarium.
“You really get the sense that there’s a mood right now where people want to be in that snap-back stage,” said Steve Joordens, a University of Toronto psychology professor, as he reflected on the lifting of restrictions. “They want to say, ‘let’s just go back and live the way we were before.’ ”
By now, the excitement of reopening is a familiar feeling for most, as the province moves to gradually lift COVID-19 restrictions yet again. But this stage of reopening is different: the threat of the Omicron variant remains potent, and official case counts are high even with limited testing and contact tracing, forcing some to tread with caution.
Read more from the Star’s Nadine Yousif.
5:30 a.m. The Ottawa Police Service says it has charged two men following demonstration-related investigations as the anti-COVID-19 vaccine mandate protest continues to keep the capital at a standstill.
Police say 37-year-old Andre Lacasse was charged on Sunday with carrying a weapon to a public meeting, while 29-year-old Matthew Dorken was charged with mischief under $5,000.
Ottawa residents frustrated with the incessant blare of truck horns, traffic gridlock and harassment by some members of the protest have questioned how police have handled the demonstration.
5:25 a.m. More provinces say they are preparing to loosen COVID-19 restrictions in the coming weeks, despite virus-related hospitalizations remaining high.
British Columbia's provincial health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, said gathering restrictions will begin to slowly be eased later this month.
Even as Alberta reported a record 1,585 people in hospital with the virus, Premier Jason Kenney said he is optimistic the province will be able to relax some public health measures and remove its vaccine passport program by the end of February, providing hospital pressures decline.
Quebec Premier Francois Legault announced yesterday that gyms and spas, which have been closed since Dec. 20, will be able to reopen on Feb. 14. He also said he is scrapping a plan to tax people who are not vaccinated against COVID-19, saying the plan has proven to be divisive at a time he wants to bring Quebecers together.
After allowing restaurant dining rooms to reopen Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said he will continue with plans to further ease restrictions on Feb. 21 and March 14, despite a warning from the province's scientific advisory panel.
5 a.m. Experts say the Omicron wave appears to be cresting but it's difficult to predict what lies ahead.
Professor Bernard Crespi, an evolutionary biologist at Simon Fraser University, says Omicron broke through people's health defences, while its quick spread left a higher degree of natural immunity. He says that means it will be difficult for the next variant to get a foothold because people either have immunity or have been vaccinated.
However, Crespi says there's always a possibility that the next variant will spread like Omicron and we'll end up with more hospitalizations and deaths. He says the transition from pandemic to fully endemic, with something like the common cold, could take anywhere from a few years to perhaps dozens or hundreds of years.
Doctor Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of Toronto, says the impact of the next variant can be blunted by a combination of vaccinations, masking and other public health guidelines, just as it was done with Omicron.
Doctor Nelson Lee, interim director of the Institute for Pandemics at the University of Toronto, says he believes the virus that causes COVID-19 will transition to an epidemic with seasonal waves like the flu.

O'Toole struggles for survival ahead of vote

Full text: Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole and his team worked furiously to salvage his leadership Tuesday, on the eve of a crucial caucus vote that some party insiders predicted he has little chance of surviving.
Conservative MPs are set to vote Wednesday on whether O'Toole ought to stay on as leader. If a majority of them don't agree that he should, he'll be shown the door.
O'Toole and some of his closest allies were working the phones Tuesday, trying to gauge whether that majority exists. But sources told the Star that his team was reaching out in some cases to MPs who have already signed on to the effort to dump him.
"He doesn't have the support he thinks he does," said one MP, speaking on the condition they not be named in order to freely discuss internal party matters.
Thirty-five Tory MPs are squarely in favour of ousting O'Toole, having signed a letter calling for a vote on whether he should remain as leader.
That effort began immediately after the Conservatives failed to beat the Liberals in the 2021 election, and has gained momentum in fits and starts as the party has struggled to make gains in popular support.
Things came to a head last week, when Conservative MPs heard the results of the party's election review. During a heated meeting, some caucus members openly challenged O'Toole in a way that left many with the impression his days were numbered.
When news of the effort to remove him broke Monday, O'Toole's response painted his critics as wanting to take the party down an angry and negative path, one that he characterized as a political dead end. He returned to that theme Tuesday during calls with his MPs, several told the Star, and promised new approaches on policy.
But trying to characterize his opponents as belonging to specific wings of the party - he cited those opposed to vaccination among them - just made him new enemies, several Tory MPs said.
"He's doing exactly what he criticizes Justin Trudeau for doing - dividing people, and pitting them against each other," one MP said.
That in turn is uniting O'Toole's critics against him, another MP said, because there is a common thread that links his detractors: broken trust.
"There is no policy idea he could put forward that would fix any of this," the MP said.
The process for a leadership review is enshrined in the Reform Act, legislation designed to give MPs more power over how their caucus runs.
To trigger a leadership review, a written notice signed by at least 20 per cent of the party's caucus is sent to the chair. With 35 of the caucus's 119 members having signed the letter, that threshold has been met.
A vote by secret ballot will be held electronically during a caucus meeting Wednesday on Zoom.
O'Toole only needs a simple majority of votes in his favour to claim the support of his caucus. However, as one MP put it to the Star on Tuesday, "even if he gets it, he doesn't really have it," given that 35 MPs have already moved against him.
If the MPs vote to replace O'Toole, a vote to choose an interim leader will be held later Wednesday evening. Names already in the mix Tuesday were deputy leader Candice Bergen, Quebec MP Gerard Deltell and former Tory cabinet minister Ed Fast.
Bergen was among the handful of Conservative MPs who voiced support for O'Toole on Tuesday.
"I want Erin O'Toole to remain as leader," she told reporters.
While grassroots efforts to turf O'Toole have sprung up since the election, one in support of his continued leadership was relaunched on Tuesday.
Fraser Macdonald, a former Conservative campaign manager in Pickering-Uxbridge, is one of the organizers of the Majority Committee, which he said is meant to encourage a silent majority of Tories who support O'Toole's approach to come forward. He said their perspectives are never voiced as loudly as those who feel the party needs to tack farther right, and it's time for a change.
Macdonald launched a petition after the 2021 election to encourage O'Toole to stay on, an effort that O'Toole seized upon as proof that he still had the support of party members. Macdonald said Tuesday afternoon that he hadn't been in contact with O'Toole's team.
Several former Tory candidates, including some in the Greater Toronto Area, voiced support for O'Toole on Tuesday, as did Alberta MP Tim Uppal and Nova Scotia MP Chris D'Entremont.
Finance critic Pierre Poilievre, who had contemplated a run for leadership in the 2020 race that O'Toole ultimately won, did not return a request for comment Tuesday. Poilievre's name tops the lists of many party insiders as the person who may make a bid if a leadership contest is called.
Another potential contender has already turned down the job. Premier Doug Ford said Tuesday he has no interest in pursuing the federal leadership.
"I have my hands full. I love being premier of this province. We're going to build this province, and I'm going to continue leading this province," said Ford, whose Progressive Conservative government is up for re-election on June 2.

Full text: Caught partying during a pandemic, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson bought himself some breathing space with an apology and a promise to change. But his troubles are far from over.
Johnson was battling to rally a rancorous Conservative party on Tuesday after an inquiry slammed failures at the top that led to Downing Street staff holding boozy parties while the country was in lockdown.
He told lawmakers in Parliament "I get it, and I will fix it," promising to overhaul the way his office runs after senior civil servant Sue Gray found in her partial report that "failures of leadership and judgment" allowed events to occur that "should not have been allowed to take place."
Johnson addressed scores of Conservative legislators behind closed doors on Monday night, assuring them he took criticisms seriously and promising to get a tighter grip on a Downing Street operation that Gray found was marked by excessive drinking and dysfunctional dynamics.
Johnson rallied his cabinet at its weekly meeting on Tuesday - where "partygate" didn't come up, Johnson's spokesperson insisted - before flying to Kyiv for talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy over the Russia-Ukraine crisis.
Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab defended Johnson, saying: "He believes he acted in good faith on the advice he had at all times."
Johnson's grip on power has been shaken by revelations that his staff held "bring your own booze" office parties, birthday celebrations and "wine time Fridays" at Downing Street at times in 2020 and 2021 when Britons were barred from socializing to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
There could be worse to come. Gray only released her findings on four of 16 events being probed, because police are investigating the other dozen - including an alleged ABBA-themed party in the prime minister's private Downing Street apartment. Gray is expected to produce a full report once the police investigation is finished. The government initially declined to promise that report would be published in full, but agreed to do so late Monday after coming under intense pressure.
For now, many Conservatives are biding their time, sticking by the leader who won them an 80-seat parliamentary majority in 2019.
The party has a history of ousting leaders once they become liabilities, and Johnson could yet face a no-confidence vote from his own side if the police or Gray produce more damning evidence. Under party rules, such a vote is triggered if 15 per cent of party lawmakers - currently 54 people - write letters calling for one.
Some Tories felt that, despite promising to change, Johnson had showed a lack of contrition and a failure to understand the anger felt at the "partygate" revelations by millions who put up with loneliness or worse in order to follow the rules.
In his meeting with lawmakers, Johnson said he was bringing back Lynton Crosby, an Australian political strategist with long ties to the Conservatives, to help him overhaul the government operation.
Former Conservative leader William Hague said Johnson had done "the minimum in responding to the report rather than (going) further in his apology and his proposals."
"Instead of reinforcing the momentum in his favour, he quite possibly stalled it," Hague wrote in The Times of London. "If I were him, I would be very worried about the number of his own MPs who asked unhelpful questions at the end of his statement."
In the House of Commons on Monday, one Conservative lawmaker, who said that he obeyed lockdown rules during the funeral of his grandmother, asked whether the prime minister "thinks I'm a fool." Former Prime Minister Theresa May accused Johnson and his staff of thinking the rules didn't apply to them.
Former cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell, who withdrew his support from Johnson on Monday, said the crisis was corroding the party like "battery acid."

Full text: For many long years, the federal Conservatives have been two factions warring in the bosom of a single party.
That alone means it's not entirely a bad thing for leader Erin O'Toole to have a caucus revolt brought into the open and for the party's MPs to have to decide what they want to be.
For O'Toole personally, a clean execution is probably preferable to a slow death by a thousand treacheries.
To his credit, he welcomed the challenge to his leadership by about a third of his MPs. And he aptly laid out the stark choice they face.
"There are two roads open to the party," O'Toole said. "(One) is angry, negative and extreme. It is a dead end."
The other, he went on, is "to recognize that conservatism is organic, not static, and that a winning message is one of inclusion, optimism, ideas, and hope."
That's the path to a more modern middle that O'Toole has followed, if erratically, since he succeeded Andrew Scheer as leader.
The Conservative rift has long-standing fault lines. In the 1980s, former prime minister Brian Mulroney married western conservatives, Ontario moderates and Quebec nationalists in a Progressive Conservative coalition that delivered two sweeping majorities.
But that union didn't hold.
Western discontent gave rise to the Reform party; in Quebec there rose the Bloc Québécois. Then came the Canadian Alliance, which swallowed the remnant PCs to become the more right-wing Conservative Party of Canada.
For a time, power allowed former PM Stephen Harper to paper over the cracks. Loss of it exposed Scheer and O'Toole to the challenge of trying to reconcile disparate wings of the party without the carrots and sticks of office.
It's no coincidence that the Conservative festering erupted in tandem with the egregious display by protesters jamming the streets of Ottawa this week.
The standoff in the streets is the Conservative identity crisis made manifest.
The challenge to O'Toole's leadership has been coming since the disappointing results of last year's federal election that saw re-election of a Liberal minority, and since he had the party back a bill banning conversion therapy.
It all adds up to a very good week for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Liberals.
Both the appalling antics of the demonstrators and the internal Conservative ruckus makes Trudeau look strong, settled and serene by comparison.
For their part, both O'Toole and the Conservative rebels face unpalatable options.
The party can either moderate and follow O'Toole's move to the centre or consign itself to a long stint on the margins as champions of a constituency that isn't big enough ever to form government.
If O'Toole's critics do manage to yank the party back in line with its conservative base, it would be a classic Pyrrhic victory. It would deny the basic reality of where Canadian elections are won. It's the road to oblivion.
For O'Toole, his continued leadership is already probably untenable.
If he loses the caucus challenge, he's out as leader. But even if he fights it off, the implacable wing of his party demanding his ouster is not going away. The internecine intrigue will continue.
It's axiomatic in politics that the greatest danger to a leader comes as often from his or her supposed friends as from foes. To his considerable dismay, Erin O'Toole is discovering the truth of that.
Meanwhile, the prime minister and the Liberals can look on with no small satisfaction.

In Ottawa, frustration over costs of protest: Local politicians call on province for financial assistance

Full text: Ottawa residents are starting to wonder who will be left holding the bag when the anti-vaccine mandate protest that has seized the capital, shuttered businesses and racked up policing costs finally rolls out.
Crowds that first arrived Friday have thinned out considerably on Parliament Hill and the surrounding area, where anti-COVID-19 restriction demonstrators have been protesting, and honking loudly, for days.
But Ottawa remains at a standstill, as trucks and big rigs remain along major roads in the downtown core. Many businesses have remained closed since Friday over safety concerns.
Robin Seguin made the difficult decision to close her 98-year-old barbershop on O'Connor Street, near Parliament Hill, ahead of the convoy's arrival. "I am angry and I'm frustrated," she said after losing income for three days.
She said some others have suggested business owners should be entitled to some of the $9.7 million raised through a GoFundMe campaign for the convoy, but she's doesn't know how that would happen. "Who do we sue?" she said.
She suggested governments could instead create a targeted fund to help and compensate businesses disrupted by the demonstrations.
Premier Doug Ford said Tuesday that the protesters have been heard, and now it is time for them to go home.
"I get it, I hear you. But we have to let the people of Ottawa live their lives," Ford said.
The city councillor and the member of provincial legislature who represent the area have written to Ford to ask for financial assistance to clean up the mess left by demonstrators. They are also seeking support for the already struggling businesses that have been closed since the convoy arrived.
Police estimate they have spent roughly $800,000 per day to supervise the protest and respond to emergencies.
The Ottawa Police Service said late Tuesday it had arrested and charged two Ottawa men following demonstration-related investigations. Police said in a release that Andre Lacasse, 37, was charged on Sunday with carrying a weapon to a public meeting and Matthew Dorken, 29, was charged with mischief under $5,000.

Full text: No matter what happens - whether Conservative MPs show Erin O'Toole the door or keep him as leader - the result will be a deeply divided caucus and a dead or dying leader at their feet.
MPs expect the vote will be close; each side is predicting victory.
The group of MPs who want to see O'Toole gone hold various grievances about their leader.
Some believe O'Toole's office leaked disparaging information about Alberta MP Shannon Stubbs to a newspaper and that the leader lied about it to caucus.
Some feel betrayed O'Toole promised to uphold conscience rights during his leadership, only to reverse course during the election campaign and surprise MPs with a unanimous consent motion in Parliament giving swift passage to the Liberals' conversion therapy ban.
Some are disappointed the party lost seats in Western Canada and failed to crack the suburbs around the Greater Toronto Area. They feel the leader is insufficiently focused on outreach to ethnic communities, and are dismayed he won't denounce Quebec's discriminatory Bill 21.
Some just don't like him. Many, actually. Several Conservatives during the last leadership race told me they chose to support Peter MacKay, despite his pro-choice stance, because they felt he was a better person.
In the past week, O'Toole has been called a bully privately, and a liar publicly by his own MPs. Under the cloak of anonymity, they speak of his vindictiveness.
Mostly what unites the dissenters is a belief that they cannot win with O'Toole at the helm. That his flip flops, over the carbon tax, gun control, or even last week's meeting with truckers, are too frequent. That O'Toole can't take a stand or keep his message focused. That he lacks authenticity. This view, coupled with his declining approval rating, last week's whitewash report of his election performance, and the party's latest fundraising numbers - the worst Q4 result since 2004 - made for a toxic brew.
Those who support O'Toole mostly share the vision he now espouses - a desire to see the party reach toward the political centre to disenchanted blue Liberals and blue-collar New Democrats and a belief that this is key to making inroads in suburban areas and winning government. They want a leader who is pro-choice and believes human activity causes climate change.
Ironically, O'Toole, who ran for his party's leadership as a "true blue" Conservative and painted MacKay, his opponent, as liberal light, is now dependent on MacKay's supporters to ensure his leadership survives.
In this group, too, however, there are those who dislike the leader. These fence sitters mostly fear what's next.
A vote that gets rid of O'Toole will likely mean a short leadership race - it is a minority government after all. That benefits leadership contenders that already have a firm grip on the party, a base they can mobilize, such as popular Ottawa-area MP Pierre Poilievre, or Haldimand-Norfolk MP Leslyn Lewis, a favourite amongst social conservatives.
There will be little time for newcomers to get organized.
Both Poilievre and Lewis recently promoted their presence at the truck convoy protest. Although both espouse messages of unity, there is a fear shared by some MPs that under their leadership, the party would be catering to a right wing that could hold it hostage just as the convoy has done to Ottawa. Few of these MPs want to see their party co-opted, like the U.S. Republican party, by more extremist elements, further alienating them from mainstream voters.
O'Toole has played to these concerns. In his late-night missive on social media Monday, he told the party there are two roads open to the Conservatives: a dead-end angry, negative, and extreme road that will see the Tories become "the NDP of the right." And another road, that is inclusive, optimistic, full of ideas and hope. (The suggestion is that this is the road O'Toole will take though it isn't clear it's the one he is on.) He welcomed the vote calling it a "time for reckoning," and urging caucus to settle the issue "Right here. Right now. Once and for all."
Of course, if he manages to hang on, questions about his leadership won't be put to rest once and for all.
O'Toole will still face calls by electoral district associations for an earlier leadership review from party members, a petition from Sen. Denise Batters calling for the same; and if those efforts fail, a leadership vote in August 2023.
(Though some dissenters fear O'Toole will push this leadership review back arguing that the party shouldn't be destabilized so close to a possible election.)
Whether he wins or loses Wednesday, O'Toole will still have lost. His caucus will be split; his leadership still challenged. And if he goes on a witch hunt, punishing or turfing more than a third of his MPs, as some fear, his party will be further weakened.

Ford's Tories fundraising off Star story on Del Duca

Full text: The ghosts of elections past appear to be haunting Doug Ford's Progressive Conservatives.
With the June 2 vote just 17 weeks away, the Tories have sent out a fundraising appeal blasting the campaign veterans advising Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca.
"Who is actually behind Del Duca? Are you curious as to who is running the show for the Del Duca Liberals?" the email blast reads.
"Well, thanks to the Toronto Star, we now have a pretty good idea," the Tory missive continues before linking to a Jan. 24 Star story that revealed Del Duca has turned "to veterans of McGuinty and Wynne campaigns to defeat Doug Ford."
According to the PC email - signed "Ontario PC Party" instead of by Ford or by a cabinet minister or by fundraising chair Tony Miele - "this prospect scares me..."
Such fears may be understandable given the results of four of the past five Ontario elections.
The Liberals cited - including Don Guy, David Gene, Bob Lopinski, and Christine McMillan - helped former premiers Dalton McGuinty and Kathleen Wynne triumph in 2003, 2007, 2011, and 2014.
In each of those elections, the Tories finished second under leaders Ernie Eves, John Tory, and Tim Hudak.
"These 'veterans' are the same staffers who drove Ontario's economy into the ground," the Tory email adds.
"They are the same people responsible for Ontario's hydro rates going through the roof," it says, neglecting to note that Ford has yet to keep his cornerstone 2018 campaign pledge to reduce electricity rates by 12 per cent.

Full text: No, the New Democratic Party is not a party of Nazi lovers.
But until today, it was a safe space for a Nazi honourer.
Belatedly, Ontario's NDP announced Monday that former Ajax mayor Steve Parish would no longer be on the ballot in the June 2 election.
The high-profile politician was dogged by controversy after his relentless campaign to commemorate German naval commander Hans Langsdorff by naming a street after this "remarkable leader" in a 2007 ceremony as mayor. He came out of retirement in 2020 to oppose any removal of the name, and stuck to his guns in 2022 while campaigning as a New Democrat.
Through it all, NDP Leader Andrea Horwath stood by her star candidate. No New Democrat left behind - even if supporters and party members were abandoning Horwath in the aftermath.
The public response to my Saturday column, and from people in the party, appears to have given Horwath pause. The column deconstructed Parish's bizarre obsession with Langsdorff Avenue, and alerted more people to the little-known story of how he sullied Ajax with a street name.
"I have decided that Steve Parish cannot be a candidate for the NDP," Horwath declared late Monday. "The NDP's vetting process gave us confidence that Mr. Parish does not hold antisemitic views. However, our party is committed to naming and correcting injustice, and vowing to do better - and as a candidate he has not met the mark."
Parish - who boasted that he was recruited by the party - dug himself in even deeper a few days ago by issuing a phoney apology acknowledging merely that he "caused pain to some people in the Jewish community." As if only Jews might be hurt or scandalized by commemorating a Nazi fighter.
Turns out he was wrong about that. Some of his strongest opponents were the racialized non-Jews - newly elected councillors - who in 2020 overruled him by rescinding the Langsdorff street name.
The bigger problem with his grudging apology? It was utterly performative and political - conceding nothing while concealing what Parish truly thinks of honouring a military man who pledged loyalty to Adolf Hitler as a "prophet."
Nowhere did Parish acknowledge the folly and the offence of affixing a Nazi's name on a street sign where people go about their lives - as opposed to perhaps a plaque in a dusty military museum exhibit, or an online history text for lovers of naval warfare marvelling at the apparent professionalism of this captain. And yes, I have read the letters and tweets from those who ardently defend Langsdorff for merely doing his duty to fatherland - and Führer - as if that somehow merits commemoration in a Toronto bedroom community.
Yet Horwath at first pronounced herself fully satisfied with his hollow words. Even with International Holocaust Remembrance Day looming, she initially echoed Parish's misplaced assertion that only Jews might be offended by honouring a Nazi.
"Steve Parish has apologized unreservedly and acknowledged the pain it caused for Jewish Ontarians," she said at the time, noting approvingly that it was "without equivocation."
Some New Democrats saw what their leader overlooked and pointed out the hypocrisy. Other New Democrats gave up on the party entirely.
"You equivocate when it comes to Mr. Parish's support for renaming a street after a Nazi naval commander," wrote Leslie Wolfe, a longtime teachers' union activist who announced on social media that she was cancelling her NDP membership in Toronto's St. Paul's riding.
"Andrea Horwath's statement of Support for Mr. Parish's candidacy, while also stating support for the Jewish community and against Jew-hatred, is simply the party speaking out of both sides of its mouth."
That is precisely what Parish did every step of the way. To watch his performance at the 2020 meeting where he adamantly defended his legacy on Langsdorff is to see a politician who prefers preaching to pausing and listening.
Never mind the impassioned presentations by two Jews at the Ajax council meeting that day - rabbi Tzali Borenstein, and Holocaust survivor and educator Max Eisen, both of whose families perished in Hitler's gas chambers. They and others were well-meaning but merely misinformed about history, Parish countered in a perfectly patronizing tone.
After a weekend of reflection and resignations, Horwath herself had second thoughts.
"Mr. Parish has not denounced the decision to have a street named after a high-ranking German officer in the Second World War," she declared in Monday's statement.
"Perhaps most importantly he has not demonstrated that he understands why that is harmful. I want to thank the grassroots New Democrats, community members and Jewish leaders who took time to meet with me to discuss this issue."
Parish is not ignorant of history and he is no Holocaust denier, for he publicly acknowledged the deaths of six million Jews. But his is a blinkered view of the cold reality of history. It's not that he is antisemitic, merely unempathetic.
As a commander, Langsdorff "was carrying out his duty," Parish lectured the newly elected councillors two years ago. "Council will want to do what's right ... people should not be slurred," he demurred.
"Ajax has always, I'm proud to say - and continues to be - a leader with respect to diversity," he boasted.
Ah, diversity. Regional (and racialized) councillor Sterling Lee had a question:
"How many racialized or representative groups that were affected by the Holocaust were in those decisions ... synagogues, the Polish community, the Roma, anything like that, the homosexual community?" Lee asked.
"I'm not sure I'd recollect that," Parish replied.
Diversity is normally a big deal for putative progressives. It seems odd that Parish was stumped by the question.
The town's newly hired diversity and inclusion co-ordinator, Natasha Sharma, was asked for her own analysis:
"Through my diversity and inclusion lens, I do think that naming a street after a commander and captain of a German warship is problematic," Sharma told council, noting she had dug into the town's archives to get the full story of Langsdorff's history - and the larger reality.
"The lives of millions of people from the Jewish community were taken," she continued. "That is more painful to the Jewish community, who is still in healing and mourning for the atrocities that have been experienced."
On the sidelines of the Zoom meeting, Parish was listening quietly - without quite listening up. Two years later, Horwath's NDP has now heard the message loud and clear.

Trudeau, O'Toole scrap over who's to blame for protest

Full text: The political tension around protests on Parliament Hill thickened Monday as the Liberals and Conservatives denounced each other's responses to the demonstrations, even as the anti-vaccination mandate crowd began to thin.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau suggested those opposed to COVID-19 vaccination mandates who flocked to Parliament Hill over the weekend have fallen prey to conspiracy theories about "microchips, about God knows what else that go with tinfoil hats."
And acts of hate that occurred during the protest - like waving Nazi flags and the desecrating of the National War Memorial - should give politicians like Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole pause before they cast their lot with the demonstrators, Trudeau said.
"I think Erin O'Toole is going to need to reflect very carefully on how he's walking a path that supports these people who do not represent truckers, let alone the vast majority of Canadians," Trudeau told a news conference Monday.
The "Freedom Convoy" protest was spurred by a requirement for commercial truckers to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to drive across the Canada-U.S. border. The U.S. imposed a similar rule.
Thousands of protesters converged on Ottawa to protest the vaccination mandates.
While the Canadian Trucking Alliances said the vast majority of truckers are vaccinated, the demonstration also drew people from outside the industry who voiced concerns and frustrations with ongoing pandemic restrictions. Those are the people the Conservatives have said they are supporting, and O'Toole met with a handful of truckers on their way into Ottawa on Friday.
Over the course of the weekend, some protesters refused to wear masks inside shopping malls and harassed staff, leading to widespread business closures downtown. Workers at a homeless shelter were threatened, protesters danced on the National War Monument, and Nazi flags and other racist images were displayed in the crowd.
On Monday, O'Toole denounced those behind what he called the "handful of unacceptable incidents."
What is driving the protests are anger and fear, he told a Facebook Live event, which are the product of the politics Trudeau was playing with by campaigning on vaccination mandates last year.
"We as a country need to ask ourselves, how did we end up with division and vaccine politics that look more like America's than anywhere else? How did Canada, a country that has always prized dialogue, discussion, moderation, end up with this anger and spite in our politics?" O'Toole asked.
Trudeau announced Monday that he had tested positive for COVID-19, a diagnosis that came after one of his children tested positive last week.
He will remain in isolation for at least five days, but said his government won't be cowed by the display on the streets, nor will it meet with the protesters, calling them an affront to those who have done "the right thing" and been vaccinated to help end the pandemic.
"Canadians know where I stand," he said. "This is a moment for responsible leaders to think carefully about where they stand and who they stand with."
The fight over the protests dominated much of the year's first question period in the House of Commons, and Liberal House Leader Mark Holland's plea for all sides to tone it down was met with jeers from across the aisle.
The lone olive branch extended by the Tories to the Liberals was a wish for Trudeau's speedy recovery, and O'Toole's acknowledgment that his own family has had COVID-19.
O'Toole's diagnosis came just as he was set to take his seat in the Commons in the fall of 2020 as the newly elected party leader, an inauspicious beginning to what's been a challenging 18 months in the job.
Amid calls to step down and direct challenges from his MPs, O'Toole's defence of the truckers and meeting with them capped a particularly difficult few weeks, which included a presentation to caucus on the party's failure to win last year's election.
Among the report's conclusions was that O'Toole failed to be authentic and take definitive positions on issues that were important to voters, something he alluded to in his remarks Monday.

Full text: Pressure is building to develop stronger sanctions for errant MPPs after independent member Randy Hillier - who was censured last fall for "disreputable conduct" - called federal Transport Minister Omar Alghabra a "terrorist" on Twitter last week.
Opposition parties are urging Premier Doug Ford's government to work with them on tougher measures for inappropriate conduct than just a censure by a vote of members in the Ontario Legislature.
"We have to do something," Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca said Friday. "What he did was vile."
In a letter to Ford, New Democrat Leader Andrea Horwath called for "all sanctions possible" to be levied against Hillier in the wake of a "hateful, ignorant and absolutely unacceptable" Twitter post last Monday.
Hillier referred to Alghabra, who is Muslim, as a "terrorist" in response to the federal government's COVID-19 vaccination mandate for truckers crossing the U.S. border, and suggested the policy is leading to empty supermarket shelves.
Government House Leader Paul Calandra said the censure mechanism used against the MPP in October remains available.
"Mr. Hillier's comments are deplorable and he should apologize for them. Racism and Islamophobia are never acceptable," Calandra added in a statement.
"The assembly censured Mr. Hillier last year for other inappropriate Twitter posts. A decision to censure Mr. Hillier again for his recent comments would be a decision of the assembly as a whole."
But opposition parties said that's no longer enough, and maintain that stronger penalties are needed to send a message, although no specific suggestions were made.
"You've got to make it abundantly clear that none of us is going to accept that this is right," said Del Duca. "Given what we are seeing these days with so many horrible things being said and done around this province with Islamophobia, antisemitism and hate, you have to call it out."
Horwath said the government has the power to issue an order of reference for an investigation by a standing committee of MPPs.
"There must be actual consequences for MPP Hillier's actions," she wrote in the letter.
Ted Arnott, the speaker of the legislature, said he has no power to regulate the content of an MPP's social media posts.
"The House might consider further action to discipline Mr. Hillier, but the speaker has no power to act unilaterally,' he added, noting MPPs have banded together "at least once" to declare a member's seat vacant. One occasion was in the 19th century under "quite different" circumstances, Arnott said.
Reached in Ottawa where he is attending the truckers' protest, Hillier sent the Star pictures of empty supermarket shelves and reiterated accusations that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is "committing an act of domestic terrorism" and that Ford is "complicit" by ordering pandemic restrictions.
Hillier, who has been a fixture at anti-lockdown protests and opposes vaccination mandates, did not address his Alghabra comment.
The veteran MPP for Lanark-Frontenac-Kingston was kicked out of the Progressive Conservative caucus by Ford in 2019 following complaints over his behaviour and accusations he taunted parents of autistic children. Hillier said the real reason was that he was at odds with the premier's office.

Premier Doug Ford's Tories fundraising off Star story on Del Duca's Liberal campaign staff

Full text: The ghosts of elections past appear to be haunting Doug Ford ’s Progressive Conservatives.
With the June 2 vote just 17 weeks away, the Tories have sent out a fundraising appeal blasting the campaign veterans advising Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca .
“Who is actually behind Del Duca? Are you curious as to who is running the show for the Del Duca Liberals?” the email blast reads.
“Well, thanks to the Toronto Star, we now have a pretty good idea,” the Tory missive continues before linking to a Jan. 24 Star story that revealed Del Duca has turned “to veterans of McGuinty and Wynne campaigns to defeat Doug Ford.”
According to the PC email — signed “Ontario PC Party” instead of by Ford or by a cabinet minister or by fundraising chair Tony Miele — “this prospect scares me...”
Such fears may be understandable given the results of four of the past five Ontario elections.
The Liberals cited — including Don Guy, David Gene, Bob Lopinski, and Christine McMillan — helped former premiers Dalton McGuinty and Kathleen Wynne triumph in 2003, 2007, 2011, and 2014.
In each of those elections, the Tories finished second under leaders Ernie Eves, John Tory, and Tim Hudak.
“These ‘veterans’ are the same staffers who drove Ontario’s economy into the ground,” the Tory email adds.
“They are the same people responsible for Ontario’s hydro rates going through the roof,” it says, neglecting to note that Ford has yet to keep his cornerstone 2018 campaign pledge to reduce electricity rates by 12 per cent.
“We need you to help fund our PC Victory Fund to ensure that Steven Del Duca or his team never get anywhere near the premier’s office in 2022.”
The Star article also jolted the Liberal campaign.
“There was some talk about part of our team that’s helping rebuild @OntLiberal & to defeat Ford,” tweeted McMillan, the campaign director, last Tuesday.
“It was about us veterans ... How about we talk about a few of the up and coming campaigners,” she tweeted , before touting nine younger Liberals on the campaign, several of whom were also mentioned in the Star story.
“All together, we’ll get this done!”

Erin O'Toole's leadership may have become unsalvageable

Full text: Erin O’Toole became Conservative party leader on Aug. 24, 2020. It is beginning to look like he will not make his two-year anniversary.
The divisions that emerged this past week, between him and his chief caucus rival Pierre Poilievre over the truckers’ pointless convoy to Ottawa, may now have become unbridgeable. The convoy cost and raised a lot of money — all for nothing, as the U.S. forbids unvaxxed drivers from crossing the border , too.
But O’Toole’s shambolic media event Thursday night, where he flipped one more time to announce he would meet with the truckers’ convoy , may have sealed his fate. It came only hours after a stinging report to caucus on the 2021 campaign gaffes, and what it described as his problems with appearing “authentic” in the eyes of Canadian voters.
Make no mistake: according to several party insiders, it is the former Albertan Poilievre, the party’s finance critic, who has been carefully greasing the skids under his leader. Poilievre chose not to seek the leadership last time, say insiders, for “personal” reasons. He seems to have decided these reasons no longer apply, and has been cultivating allies to undermine O’Toole’s leadership for months.
The Conservative caucus clearly instructed O’Toole to ignore the humiliating attacks on him, and ordered him to meet with the truckers’ representatives. Some of those organizers are Islamophobic, antisemitic, white supremacists. Probably not wise for a leader who admitted the party’s problems with “new Canadians,” as he delicately termed them.
Unlike his rival, Erin O’Toole is decent, tolerant and thoughtful — if not tough enough to be a successful political leader. His are not the personal values required to lead the party of the angry that the Conservatives have become. Incredibly, former leader Andrew Scheer called Justin Trudeau this week “the greatest threat to freedom” in Canada. Under tough media questioning, O’Toole refused to denounce such language.
O’Toole’s efforts to nudge the party to the mainstream of Canadian politics failed as result of his inability to wield a credible stick. His failure to denounce Poilievre and Scheer signalled to treacherous MPs they need not fear retribution. This is not tenable for a leader seeking to stare down internal rivals — one cannot overstate how brutal would have been the retribution of a Jean Chrétien or a Brian Mulroney at such impertinence.
The internal rebels would be wise to reflect on what they wish for. A Poilievre-led Conservative party would probably do worse than any leader since Kim Campbell. Liberals and New Democrats will be drooling at the prospect of a contest with him for the support of the vast majority of Canadians who live in cities — people who believe in vaccination and racial and social inclusion, and who do not see political venom as the Trumpian motivator of their political choices. Mistaking angry Prairie voters, anti-vax truckers and Western separatists as a foundation for a national political party is simply delusional.
The 60,000 bewildered donors who contributed nearly $7 million to the convoy this week are troubling. The truckers’ violent rhetoric directed at the prime minister, journalists and non-white Canadians is very disturbing. But even if their supporters across Canada number in the tens of thousands more, together they represent a tiny fraction of Canadian voters.
The Conservative party caucus meeting next week will be at a minimum awkward, and more likely foreboding for O’Toole’s future. If violence did erupt on the Hill this weekend, the Conservatives will own some of it. If none of the party’s saner internal leaders stand and thunderously denounce those chipping away at O’Toole’s leadership, the clock will begin ticking for a sad but inevitable exit. So far, they have shown little gumption in challenging the Poilievre faction.
If this ends as it is increasingly looking like, the rebels will rue the day they unseated yet another Tory leader. The presumptive heir will not only fail to lead them to the Conservative promised land — he will take many others who joined the conspiracy down with him.

Full text: Fringe parties want to spoil it for Ford, Jan. 23
Martin Regg Cohn’s analysis of the potential for Doug Ford to be defeated, or at least held to a minority, in the June 2 provincial election by anti-lockdown, anti-vax voters is spot on. However, it should not be left up to this fringe element to possibly unseat Doug Ford.
Since the onset of the pandemic, when it became obvious that strong measures would be needed to protect the population and our health-care system, Doug Ford has done his very best to pander to his Conservative, Ford Nation base. He resisted lockdowns until it was too late. He reopened too soon only to have to lockdown again. He delayed as long as he possibly could the implementation of vaccination certificates which he also promised, and still promises, to get rid of as soon as possible. And he continues to steadfastly refuse to provide adequate paid sick days to help mitigate the spread of the virus.
At every crisis point during the pandemic, the severity and duration of the second, third, fourth, and now the fifth wave have been exacerbated by Doug Ford’s need to appease his base.
The voters who should ensure Doug Ford’s defeat on June 2 are not those disgruntled former supporters.
Doug Ford’s humiliating downfall should come at the hands of the fully vaccinated citizens of this province who have been unnecessarily put at risk and significantly inconvenienced by the misguided partisan actions of this inept Premier.

Full text: Erin O'Toole became Conservative party leader on Aug. 24, 2020. It is beginning to look like he will not make his two-year anniversary.
The divisions that emerged this past week, between him and his chief caucus rival Pierre Poilievre over the truckers' pointless convoy to Ottawa, may now have become unbridgeable. The convoy cost and raised a lot of money - all for nothing, as the U.S. forbids unvaxxed drivers from crossing the border, too.
But O'Toole's shambolic media event Thursday night, where he flipped one more time to announce he would meet with the truckers' convoy, may have sealed his fate. It came only hours after a stinging report to caucus on the 2021 campaign gaffes, and what it described as his problems with appearing "authentic" in the eyes of Canadian voters.
Make no mistake: according to several party insiders, it is the former Albertan Poilievre, the party's finance critic, who has been carefully greasing the skids under his leader. Poilievre chose not to seek the leadership last time, say insiders, for "personal" reasons. He seems to have decided these reasons no longer apply, and has been cultivating allies to undermine O'Toole's leadership for months.
The Conservative caucus clearly instructed O'Toole to ignore the humiliating attacks on him, and ordered him to meet with the truckers' representatives. Some of whose organizers are Islamophobic, antisemitic, white supremacists. Probably not wise for a leader who admitted the party's problems with "new Canadians," as he delicately termed them.
Unlike his rival, Erin O'Toole is decent, tolerant and thoughtful - if not tough enough to be a successful political leader. His are not the personal values required to lead the party of the angry that the Conservatives have become. Incredibly, former leader Andrew Scheer called Justin Trudeau this week "the greatest threat to freedom" in Canada. Under tough media questioning, O'Toole refused to denounce such language.
O'Toole's efforts to nudge the party to the mainstream of Canadian politics failed as result of his inability to wield a credible stick. His failure to denounce Poilievre and Scheer signalled to treacherous MPs they need not fear retribution. This is not tenable for a leader seeking to stare down internal rivals - one cannot overstate how brutal would have been the retribution of a Jean Chrétien or a Brian Mulroney at such impertinence.
The internal rebels would be wise to reflect on what they wish for. A Poilievre-led Conservative party would probably do worse that any leader since Kim Campbell. Liberals and New Democrats will be drooling at the prospect of a contest with him for the support of the vast majority of Canadians who live in cities - people who believe in vaccination and racial and social inclusion, and who do not see political venom as the Trumpian motivator of their political choices. Mistaking angry Prairie voters, anti-vax truckers and Western separatists as a foundation for a national political party is simply delusional.
The 60,000 bewildered donors who contributed nearly $7 million dollars to the convoy this week are troubling. The truckers' violent rhetoric directed at the prime minister, journalists and non-white Canadians is very disturbing. But even if their supporters across Canada number in the tens of thousands more, together they represent a tiny fraction of Canadian voters.
The Conservative party caucus meeting next week will be at a minimum awkward, and more likely foreboding for O'Toole's future. If violence did erupt on the Hill this weekend, the Conservatives will own some it.
If none of the party's saner internal leaders stand and thunderously denounce those chipping away at O'Toole's leadership, the clock will begin ticking for a sad but inevitable exit. So far, they have shown little gumption in challenging the Poilievre faction.
If this ends as it is increasingly looking like, the rebels will rue the day they unseated yet another Tory leader. The presumptive heir will not only fail to lead them to the Conservative promised land - he will take many others who joined the conspiracy down with him.

Full text: To watch Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole and his caucus flounder these days is to be reminded that cream rises to the top.
In politics, that means talent, at the elected or the backroom level, is more likely to be drawn to success and power than to the alternative.
It is not just the lure of more lucrative positions.
As anyone who has served on both sides of the divide can attest, it is more rewarding to articulate and/or influence policies in government than to be tasked with criticizing them in opposition.
On that basis, having one's party in power in the provincial capitals is almost always a very mixed blessing for a federal leader.
Take the NDP. Over the past few years, the party's success in British Columbia has translated into the loss for Jagmeet Singh of most of his veteran top performers from that province.
After the federal New Democrats fell to third place in 2015, Nathan Cullen, Murray Rankin, Sheila Malcolmson and Fin Donnelly all migrated to the government benches in Victoria.
It is not an accident that some of the NDP's best years at the provincial level have often coincided with lean times for the party at the federal level.
These days that same pattern is holding true for O'Toole's Conservatives.
Indeed, it may be that one of the worst things to have happened to the federal party, post-Stephen Harper, was the return to government of its Ontario cousin four years ago.
In the case of both the Liberals and Conservatives, success at Queen's Park has systematically been coupled with a spell in opposition at the federal level, and vice versa.
When Brian Mulroney brought the Tories out of the federal wilderness in the mid-1980s, he did so with critical help from the group of strategists that had been architects of Ontario premier William Davis's victories.
Once Mulroney was in power, many Ontario backroom veterans migrated to the federal capital. The Ontario Tories, for their part, were soon consigned to opposition for a decade.
Fast forward to 2003 and Dalton McGuinty's Liberal victory. That allowed Harper a few years later to recruit the Ontario triumvirate of former provincial ministers Jim Flaherty, John Baird and Tony Clement to spearhead his Ontario candidates' team. A lot of backroom intelligence tagged along.
In the same vein, Justin Trudeau over his early years as Liberal leader and prime minister brought scores of former members of McGuinty's team to the federal backrooms.
When it comes to federal and provincial politics, there are only so many members of the A-team to turn to. Those in government generally have first dibs on recruiting them.
An internal autopsy of O'Toole's failed election campaign has just concluded that he was "over-managed" by his strategists. Since then, there have been plenty of signs that not only is O'Toole getting poor advice but that he lacks the judgment to distinguish between a promising idea and a credibility-depleting one.
But even if the Conservative leader wanted to bring on a more discerning crew to help steer his listing ship, he would find that many of his party's proven strategists are otherwise occupied. That's particularly true of Ontario, the essential piece in any federal election puzzle.
With the province about to go to the polls in the spring, and with Premier Doug Ford's prospects for victory undeniably better than O'Toole's odds at keeping his leadership, all hands are more likely be on deck for the incumbent premier of Canada's largest province than for the embattled federal leader of the Official Opposition.
From that angle, Ford's re-election later this year would not necessarily be a bad thing for Trudeau. For as long as the Tories hold Queen's Park, many of their best and brightest strategists will be content to leave their quarrelsome federal partners to their own devices.
After all, it is not inconvenient for the premier and the prime minister to have each other to blame for whatever messes unfold on their watches. The pandemic conversation has provided examples of that dynamic.
By the same token, the presence at Queen's Park of a Tory government almost always makes life harder for a federal leader of the Official Opposition of the same stripe.
How does one oppose a national policy that enjoys the support of as high-profile an ally as the premier of Canada's largest province?
Take child care: By all indications, Ontario is about to join the other provinces and the territories and sign on to Trudeau's plan.
O'Toole has promised a federal Conservative government would scrap the initiative upon taking office. But if Ford is re-elected, the Ontario Tories will be fully invested in Trudeau's child-care policy by the time Canada returns to the polls. And that stands to make the current Conservative stance untenable.
As counterintuitive as it may sound, a Progressive Conservative victory in Ontario this spring could go a long way to cement Trudeau's social policy legacy.

Full text: What message is trucker convoy trying to send?
Police prepare for possible violence as fringe groups latch on to truckers convoy, Jan. 26
This is a classic case of Animal Farm's "All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others."
Is the freedom of the so-called freedom convoy truckers more than the freedom of the vast majority of Canadians? If the aim is to "send a message" - and I can't figure out what the message is - to the government, I ask, what has happened to snail mail, email and a delegation of two or three people?

Fully vaccinated unnecessarily put at risk by Ford
Fringe parties want to spoil it
for Ford, Jan. 23
Martin Regg Cohn's analysis of the potential for Doug Ford to be defeated, or at least held to a minority, in the June 2 provincial election by anti-lockdown, anti-vax voters is spot on. However, it should not be left up to this fringe element to possibly unseat Ford.

He delayed as long as possible on vaccination certificates. And he continues to steadfastly refuse to provide adequate paid sick days to help mitigate the spread of the virus.
His downfall should come at the hands of the fully vaccinated Ontarians who have been unnecessarily put at risk and significantly inconvenienced by the misguided partisan actions of this inept premier.

We didn't prevent people from sipping Kool-Aid
The vaccine hesitant's
perspective, Jan. 22
For years before its arrival, many respected scientists and epidemiologists predicted it as being inevitable; SARS was just a shot across the bow. Globally, elected officials ignored the warning. Instead of increasing preparedness, we chose cut research and health-care funding.
Now, COVID has as its allies misinformation, conspiracy theories and outright lies promulgated by social media and by people who should know better, but must have missed the day in school where they taught critical thinking.
Erin O'Toole definitely has one thing right: there are people who will never get vaccinated.
They can never be convinced, and that is our fault. We did nothing to prevent the dispensing of the Kool-Aid that so many of them have swallowed.
Stephen Brouitt, Richmond Hill
Cutting back on meat to increase food production
Getting real about fake meat,
Jan. 23
Meghan McGee's argument barely touches on some of the environmental issues involved and fails to mention animal suffering and the link between eating red meat and getting cancer, heart disease and diabetes.
Cattle-raising uses an enormous amount of water. Large tracts of land are needed for fodder and has led to deforestation of the tropical rainforests and the resulting loss of biodiversity. The pesticides, antibiotics and hormones used to treat cattle seep into drinking water and endanger human and aquatic health.
According to the Worldwatch Institute, the only way to produce enough food is "to cut back sharply on meat consumption, because conversion of grazing land to food crops will increase the amount of food produced."

Tories' convoy of troubles

Full text: One of the more graphic rape threats I've received over the course of my talk radio career involved a reference to burning off my clitoris. It was after I had addressed the false notion that had been circulating in Conservative circles - and was being bolstered by my talk radio colleagues - that Canada signing onto the UN's Global Compact for Migration would mean that Canada would no longer have jurisdiction over its borders, ensuring the ultimate destruction of our country because of "globalists."
There was a co-ordinated campaign to poison the discourse around the compact by pushing misinformation. It worked, largely by having considerable swaths of conservative politicians and media repeat and disseminate the misinformation themselves - which is a lot like the current misinformation and disinformation campaign we're seeing regarding vaccines.
There are consequences to peddling misinformation and refusing to overtly condemn extremist rhetoric, as any journalist who has had to counter misinformation can tell you.
So it's especially worrying to see CPC MPs who are explicitly egging the protesters on by calling the prime minister the "biggest threat to freedom in Canada," stating he has a "vaccine vendetta," all the while turning a blind eye or making excuses for the more troubling aspects of the protesters and the extreme, violent language they are using.
The vast majority of truckers are fully vaccinated. The truckers who made their way to Ottawa represent a fringe minority. Political parties looking to be taken seriously do not usually try to pander to fringe minorities that are increasingly out of touch with the majority of accessible voters, though the Conservatives are certainly the exception to that.
There is a gradation when it comes to vaccine hesitancy. There is a difference between someone who harasses children entering vaccine clinics, and those who have suspicions with health care more generally. It's obvious which side of the vaccine-hesitancy spectrum most of these protesters lean toward.
As the Canadian Anti-Hate Network has reported, some of the organizers and supporters of the Freedom Convoy have very clear far-right elements to them and are overtly advocating for violence. To deny that a sizable portion of this protest movement has hateful elements to it is either wilfully blind or incredibly stupid.
The truckers represent a larger problem for the Conservatives, who keep pandering to the extremist elements of their base. Every political party has its own gaggle of objectionable supporters. Ideally, though, a party's official strategy doesn't include trying to actively appeal to them. Once you do, it's hard to convince normal voters that your party should form government.
All of this is made worse by the fact that our legacy political media has largely ignored the Conservative party's increasing willingness to placate the more unsavoury elements of their base, as well as thriving misinformation and disinformation networks.
Normalcy bias - the cognitive bias that minimizes threat warnings and ultimately leads people to underestimate the likelihood of an adverse event happening to them - is a heck of a thing, and the majority of our political coverage suffers from it.
Our unfortunate reality is that one of the two parties in regular contention to form government has sitting, prominent members who spew all sorts of conspiracy theory nonsense and have spent the better part of the last decade either disregarding the more troubling aspects of their voter base, or trying to directly pander to them.
Yet the dominant political narrative in this country continues to pretend that voters are choosing between the political equivalent of Coke and Pepsi.
Canada desperately needs a healthy Conservative party. Not whatever this is.

Full text: Pressure is building to develop stronger sanctions for errant MPPs after independent member Randy Hillier — who was censured last fall for “disreputable conduct” — called federal Transport Minister Omar Alghabra a “terrorist” on Twitter this week.
Opposition parties are urging Premier Doug Ford’s government to work with them on tougher measures for inappropriate conduct than just a censure by a vote of members in the Ontario Legislature.
“We have to do something,” Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca said Friday. “What he did was vile.”
In a letter to Ford, New Democrat Leader Andrea Horwath called for “all sanctions possible” to be levied against Hillier in the wake of a “hateful, ignorant and absolutely unacceptable” Twitter post on Monday.
Hillier referred to Alghabra, who is Muslim, as a “terrorist” in response to the federal government’s COVID-19 vaccination mandate for truckers crossing the U.S. border, and suggested the policy is leading to empty supermarket shelves.
Government House Leader Paul Calandra said the censure mechanism used against the MPP in October remains available.
“Mr. Hillier’s comments are deplorable and he should apologize for them. Racism and Islamophobia are never acceptable,” Calandra added in a statement.
“The assembly censured Mr. Hillier last year for other inappropriate Twitter posts. A decision to censure Mr. Hillier again for his recent comments would be a decision of the assembly as a whole.”
But opposition parties said that’s no longer enough, and maintain that stronger penalties are needed to send a message, although no specific suggestions were made.
“You’ve got to make it abundantly clear that none of us is going to accept that this is right,” said Del Duca. “Given what we are seeing these days with so many horrible things being said and done around this province with Islamophobia , antisemitism and hate, you have to call it out.”
Horwath said the government has the power to issue an order of reference for an investigation by a standing committee of MPPs.
“There must be actual consequences for MPP Hillier’s actions,” she wrote in the letter.
Ted Arnott, the speaker of the legislature, said he has no power to regulate the content of an MPP’s social media posts.
“The House might consider further action to discipline Mr. Hillier, but the speaker has no power to act unilaterally,’ he added, noting MPPs have banded together “at least once” to declare a member’s seat vacant. One occasion was in the 19th century under “quite different” circumstances, Arnott said.
Reached in Ottawa where he is attending the truckers’ protest , Hillier sent the Star pictures of empty supermarket shelves and reiterated accusations that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is “committing an act of domestic terrorism” and that Ford is “complicit” by ordering pandemic restrictions.
Hillier, who has been a fixture at anti-lockdown protests and opposes vaccination mandates, did not address his Alghabra comment.
The veteran MPP for Lanark-Frontenac-Kingston was kicked out of the Progressive Conservative caucus by Ford in 2019 following complaints over his behaviour and accusations he taunted parents of autistic children. Hillier said the real reason was that he was at odds with the premier’s office.
Last October, he was the subject of a unanimous censure motion by MPPs of all parties for “a string of disreputable conduct.” The motion called on him to publicly apologize for his behaviour and “to desist from further conduct that is inappropriate and unbecoming of a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.”
In November, he apologized for posting the names and photos of 11 Ontarians, who he wrongly suggested had died or suffered life-changing injuries from COVID-19 vaccinations.
“I understand my post caused greater distress to families already hurt by the loss of a loved one,” Hillier said at the time. He removed the post.
The next provincial election is June 2.

Mental health must be a priority during next Ontario campaign

Full text: Let us make a less than modest proposal.
The next designated “Let’s Talk Day” on mental health should be the day this spring that Premier Doug Ford visits the lieutenant governor to trigger an Ontario election.
And it should be reprised pretty much every day thereafter until the vote on June 2.
The crisis that is mental health care in this province should be a paramount issue for those who seek to govern. For the simple reason that it affects just about everything.
What’s needed will carry a big price tag. But failure to pay it, failure to rise to a rapidly growing challenge, will cost massively more in the long term in all manner of ways.
It’s clear by now that the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic — the lockdowns and protocols imposed to combat it — are washing over us in painful ways and are likely to do so for a generation.
Therapists and counsellors in Ontario and elsewhere have been frantically busy for most of the last two years.
A health-care system that didn’t come close to meeting demand even before the pandemic, has been overwhelmed.
As the Star’s Nadine Yousif reported this week , the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health’s latest national survey showed levels of anxiety, depression and substance use surging along with the Omicron variant’s rapid spread.
CAMH psychiatrist Dr. David Gratzer said this wave feels different from earlier ones for many people, as if “the rug has been pulled out from under them after they thought the worst was over.
“I see more pessimism and less resilience than in previous waves,” Gratzer added. “Remember, we were already in a mental-health crisis before the pandemic began, and this won’t end when the last COVID patient leaves the ICU. For health policy makers, this is a long-term issue that needs to be addressed right now.”
The survey found front-line workers and women were disproportionately struggling with anxiety and depression.
There are obvious reasons, explained Dr. Samantha Wells, a senior director of research at CAMH who helped lead the survey.
“These larger increases among women may reflect that they are often carrying a disproportionate burden, including imbalances in caregiving responsibilities and front-line work,” she said.
It’s also the case, research has shown, that women have taken the hardest economic hit over the last two years.
Even if someone had been specifically assigned to the task, they would have found it difficult to design a set of circumstances more hazardous to mental well-being than those at play during the pandemic.
It has left people disoriented, isolated and exhausted, with relationships strained and families distressed as they try to cope with disrupted education, perilous work environments, financial uncertainty.
“While people are incredibly resilient, as this pandemic wears on it’s the people working on the front lines who are among the most affected,” Wells said.
The CAMH study also found a significant increase in reports of unmet mental-health needs, with 24 per cent of those surveyed saying they had been unable to obtain needed services in the last 12 months.
Surprisingly, perhaps, it was those age 18 to 39 – not seniors – who reported the highest levels of moderate to severe anxiety, loneliness and feelings of depression.
And the CAMH survey dealt only with adults. The toll taken on children – with the disruptions to school, athletics, social lives, the lost graduations and proms that normally serve as milestones along the path to maturity – presents a looming wave of mental-health demand.
It’s safe to say that without the comfort and consolation of normal relationships, and with trust in institutions and their own futures fractured, the impact of pandemic measures will be long-lasting.
Research suggests, moreover, that the pandemic’s mental-health impact is disproportionately affecting those most vulnerable and from more complex circumstances – low-income, Indigenous and racialized groups.
“It has never been more important to invest in mental health to prepare our health-care system for the fallout from this pandemic,” said Dr. Hayley Hamilton, the other co-leader of the CAMH survey.
As the impact becomes clear, plans for services and how to fund them should be top of mind for the major challengers in the forthcoming Ontario election.
At core, government is about deciding who gets what, about how to allot finite resources to almost endless demands.
Elections are about deciding who gets to make those decisions.
No party leader who fails to spell out in the coming campaign a comprehensive mental-health program to face this challenge should be entrusted with the privilege.

Full text: From a covert network of doctors prescribing ivermectin to the truckers’ convoy, we’ve selected some of the best long reads of the week on thestar.com .
Want to dive into more long features? Sign up for the Weekend Long Reads newsletter to get them delivered to your inbox every Saturday morning.
1. A covert network of Canadian doctors is prescribing ivermectin to treat COVID. Here’s how we got some
Moments after the doctor prescribes the medication, he makes a request.
“We’re trying to keep it under the radar,” he says matter-of-factly toward the end of a 12-minute phone appointment.
“So, when you pick up the prescription bottles and the paperwork with the prescriptions, just make sure the drug names and my name are all destroyed or Sharpied out or whatever, before you throw them out.”
This is an example of how you can get ivermectin in Canada these days — and the complications around it.
A months-long Star investigation has unearthed a covert network through which physicians are prescribing ivermectin, a disproven COVID-19 treatment, to patients willing to pay.
2. Spread hatred. Face courts. Repeat. Why Canada’s ‘weak’ laws are failing to address the rise of hate
Inside a downtown Toronto courthouse this past October, Bill Whatcott chatted politely with supporters, his white hair buzzed short, a fanny pack hanging from his hip.
Stepping into the courtroom, the 54-year-old held the door for others before taking his seat to face a charge of wilful promotion of hatred , the latest in a string of hate speech allegations stretching back nearly two decades.
The self-identified evangelical Christian activist estimates he has distributed at least half a million flyers, the majority targeting abortion and homosexuality. A 2013 Supreme Court decision described language used in some of his flyers as “hate-inspiring.”
Two provincial tribunals and Canada’s highest court have found he violated hate-related human rights legislation.
But despite numerous hearings and, by his estimate, more than 30 stays in custody for his speech, Whatcott has remained undeterred.
“I’m not gonna apologize for any of my flyers … I’d rather sit in jail,” he told Toronto police in a 2018 video interview.
3. Canada’s ‘Freedom Rally’ is being watched by the world — and seen in very different ways
As supporters of a trucker convoy with its sights set on Parliament Hill roared their support in Canada’s biggest city on Thursday, heads across this country and around the world continued to turn and watch.
Elon Musk, the richest man on the planet, proclaimed on Twitter that Canadian truckers “rule.” American podcaster Joe Rogan has called ours a “country in revolt.” Here at home, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau contends the convoy represents a “fringe minority holding unacceptable views.”
Everyone, it seems, has their take on what it all means as the “Freedom Rally” plows its way toward Ottawa, due to arrive Saturday.
When it began in the West this week, it was with the relatively narrow stated goal of protesting a vaccine mandate for cross-border truckers, the rule that they quarantine after crossing the Canada-U.S. border.
As it’s neared its destination, the meaning of the protest has seemingly ballooned to supporters and critics alike — becoming more ambiguous, and, for that reason, making its outcome less predictable.
4. ‘You are alone’: The increasingly lonely road of the unvaccinated
Greg Bates was driving between Calgary and Hamilton, a long-haul domestic route that would soon be the only kind of trucking he’s allowed to do.
The man from Olds, Alta. has been driving trucks for 15 years, most recently splitting his time between domestic trips and runs down to U.S. destinations. The U.S. trips can be more lucrative (and American highways often have better bathrooms and restaurants en route, in Bates’ opinion) but they’re now off-limits.
Bates is one of thousands of truckers who haven’t gotten the COVID-19 vaccine, and so won’t be eligible to drive into Canada from the U.S. without going into quarantine.
Though he says he wants the money from the American jobs, Bates says he wants to stick to his guns about the vaccine even more. He won’t get it, he says.
“I believe the shelves will be empty by April,” Bates said, predicting that the restrictions on truckers will further strain supply-chain.
5. 100 offers on a single GTA house: why scarce listings are further driving up home prices
Every day Alicia Veilleux checks for new homes listed on Realtor.ca. She and her boyfriend have been searching for a two-bedroom house or condo since the fall. They began looking last fall in Etobicoke and Mississauga — just west of their Humber Bay Shores rental.
Most days there isn’t much new to see online even though their search now encompasses a huge swath of the GTA, including Mississauga, Milton, Oakville, Burlington and Hamilton. Lately, they’ve been trying as far afield as Guelph and Grimsby.
There might be 10 or 15 new offerings that meet their search criteria. The couple winnows it down to one or two places that are worth seeing in person.
As if house hunting wasn’t tough enough in southwestern Ontario, Veilleux and her partner are up against the lowest home inventory levels in the GTA since 2007 and, as the supply dwindles, the scarcity is pushing up prices through increasingly ferocious bidding wars.
6. He worked as a VP for Metrolinx while the agency awarded his private consulting firm contracts worth millions
Metrolinx appointed a private consultant to an executive role at the transit agency and awarded his firm valuable government work while he was in the job, the Star has learned.
​​Brian Guest, a director at the Boxfish Infrastructure Group consulting firm, held vice-president titles at Metrolinx between March 2018 and May 2020.
Over that period, the public transit agency issued two contracts to Boxfish, one of which was sole-sourced. Metrolinx refused to disclose how much taxpayer money it agreed to give to Boxfish through those deals. But according to two sources with knowledge of the arrangement, Guest’s company is currently set to earn between $20 million and $30 million from Metrolinx over a two-year period.
7. Detectives have probed Barry and Honey Sherman’s estate plans for murder clues — why, they won’t say
In Barry Sherman’s office at Apotex in mid-December 2017, homicide detectives discovered every surface — desk, tables, couches, chairs, even parts of the floor — awash in papers. The brilliant scientist, with a PhD before he was 25, was a visual person — he wanted his tasks front and centre.
Among the stacks of generic drug documents and lawsuits, police also found an “autobiography” Barry was writing and a photograph of Honey, Barry and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. In one pile, detectives spotted a copy of an airplane ticket Barry had purchased for a Dec. 24 flight to Fort Lauderdale to join Honey for a holiday break. These details and more are contained in court documents recently released following a Toronto Star challenge.
What detectives did not find in the Sherman office or their home was the last will and testament for either of the Shermans. For reasons still sealed by a judge’s order, police wanted to know the estate planning details for the murdered couple, and they reached out to people who knew the Shermans for assistance. So secretive are the police that while they have released to the Star what they learned when they later obtained the estate documents, they refuse to say where and how many times this information appears in their requests for search warrants and production orders — though they have confirmed the Sherman estate information appears in “a number of” the requests put before Ontario court judge Leslie Pringle. Pringle has authorized all of the police requests for searches.
8. Doug Ford is the only premier who has yet to sign Ottawa’s $10-a-day child-care deal. He’s right to push back
This may stop you in your tracks, but I sympathize with Doug Ford’s hesitation to sign on to Ottawa’s national early learning and child care program, which has the goal of providing Canadian parents with $10-a-day child care for children younger than six within the next five years, writes Star contributing columnist Armine Yalnizyan.
What we know so far is that Ottawa is offering the province of Ontario $10.2 billion dollars to meet that target. The funding has two main goals: lower costs for parents, and increased access to high-quality, licensed early learning and child care.
So I know how preposterous my position sounds.
After all, I’ve been arguing non-stop that a lack of high-quality, affordable child care is throttling our ability to bounce back from the pandemic, not just for businesses and our economy as a whole, but for the women who have been trying to do it all, the paid and unpaid work in and outside the home, with more aggravation than help from the province.
So why might stalling an agreement with only 128 days before the next provincial election be reasonable?
9. Applicants to Canada’s skilled-worker immigration program will soon face 36-month wait times, documents reveal
Kartikay Sharma has a master’s degree in civil engineering and works as a researcher in building energy efficiency — knowledge and skills that are highly sought after in Canada these days.
In fact, Canada had selected and invited the Indian man to apply for permanent residence back in December 2020.
Yet, more than a year after that offer, the 27-year-old is still waiting for Canada to complete his application and let him into the country.
Sharma is among thousands of skilled immigration applicants overseas whose lives and plans are in limbo, as Canada has halted the federal skilled immigration program since then in order to prioritize applicants already in Canada and to address Afghan refugee resettlement.
10. ‘A major realignment’: More than 200,000 restaurant workers left the industry during the pandemic. Here’s where they went
Meghan Hein wanted to become a “digital nomad,” someone who could up and leave with little more than a laptop and charger and still earn a living. Early in the pandemic, she left her two server jobs in Toronto and started working as a web developer.
“Now I can move to Mexico for the winter and still have work,” said Hein, 33.
Peter Ramsay, 40, wanted a desk job. After two decades flipping burgers and chopping vegetables, he was starting to feel it in the knees.
“I was getting too physically old to be working a cook’s line every night,” he confessed.
Nick Watson, a bartender who spent six years in one of Toronto’s busiest hotels, just wanted some peace and quiet. Earlier this year, the 39-year-old bought a home outside the city and became a florist.
“The lockdowns gave me time to think about what made me happy and what didn’t,” he said.
These three workers are among the 205,800 Canadians who left their jobs in the food service industry during the COVID-19 pandemic and started anew.
11. When a father of triplets lost his wife, Regent Park rallied around him
It’s bedtime and Curtis McCleary is trying to get Milah, one of his four-year-old triplets, to settle in her bed.
“She sleeps alone. If she doesn’t fall asleep first she’ll keep the other girls awake,” McCleary tells a reporter he has invited into his home.
A few minutes later, little Milah opens her bedroom door and pokes her head out. Dad gently coaxes her back to bed, the other girls, Miyah and Miliyah, observing with wide-eyed wonder as their sister gets into mischief.
When he’s not busy chasing after the youngsters in the three-bedroom unit you’ll see Curtis McCleary wheeling his daughters around Toronto’s Regent Park neighbourhood in their covered wagon.
He’s somewhat of a unicorn. McCleary, 29, is a single father of triplets. And a widower.
12. Athletes are pushing back against permitting trans competitors like Lia Thomas. What’s fair?
When Lia Thomas won the 1,650-yard freestyle swimming event in Akron last month, she finished 38 seconds faster than her nearest opponent.
She also beat the 500-yard freestyle field by 14 seconds.
Those are astonishing statistics. They’re also an abomination for women’s sports.
The 22-year-old transgender athlete is competing in her first season as a female. Thomas had previously competed for two seasons as a male for the University of Pennsylvania. Then she underwent more than two years of hormone therapy and joined the women’s team, where she is crushing Ivy League and NCAA records.

Full text: MONTREAL—To watch Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole and his caucus flounder these days is to be reminded that cream rises to the top.
In politics, that means talent, at the elected or the backroom level, is more likely to be drawn to success and power than to the alternative.
It is not just the lure of more lucrative positions.
As anyone who has served on both sides of the divide can attest, it is more rewarding to articulate and/or influence policies in government than to be tasked with criticizing them in opposition.
On that basis, having one’s party in power in the provincial capitals is almost always a very mixed blessing for a federal leader.
Take the NDP. Over the past few years, the party’s success in British Columbia has translated into the loss for Jagmeet Singh of most of his veteran top performers from that province.
After the federal New Democrats fell to third place in 2015, Nathan Cullen, Murray Rankin, Sheila Malcolmson and Fin Donnelly all migrated to the government benches in Victoria.
It is not an accident that some of the NDP’s best years at the provincial level have often coincided with lean times for the party at the federal level.
These days that same pattern is holding true for O’Toole’s Conservatives.
Indeed, it may be that one of the worst things to have happened to the federal party, post-Stephen Harper, was the return to government of its Ontario cousin four years ago.
In the case of both the Liberals and Conservatives, success at Queen’s Park has systematically been coupled with a spell in opposition at the federal level, and vice versa.
When Brian Mulroney brought the Tories out of the federal wilderness in the mid-1980s, he did so with critical help from the group of strategists that had been architects of Ontario premier William Davis’s victories.
Once Mulroney was in power, many Ontario backroom veterans migrated to the federal capital. The Ontario Tories, for their part, were soon consigned to opposition for a decade.
Fast forward to 2003 and Dalton McGuinty’s Liberal victory. That allowed Harper a few years later to recruit the Ontario triumvirate of former provincial ministers Jim Flaherty, John Baird and Tony Clement to spearhead his Ontario candidates’ team. A lot of backroom intelligence tagged along.
In the same vein, Justin Trudeau over his early years as Liberal leader and prime minister brought scores of former members of McGuinty’s team to the federal backrooms.
When it comes to federal and provincial politics, there are only so many members of the A-team to turn to. Those in government generally have first dibs on recruiting them.
An internal autopsy of O’Toole’s failed election campaign has just concluded that he was “over-managed” by his strategists. Since then, there have been plenty of signs that not only is O’Toole getting poor advice but that he lacks the judgment to distinguish between a promising idea and a credibility-depleting one.
But even if the Conservative leader wanted to bring on a more discerning crew to help steer his listing ship, he would find that many of his party’s proven strategists are otherwise occupied. That’s particularly true of Ontario, the essential piece in any federal election puzzle.
With the province about to go to the polls in the spring, and with Premier Doug Ford’s prospects for victory undeniably better than O’Toole’s odds at keeping his leadership, all hands are more likely be on deck for the incumbent premier of Canada’s largest province than for the embattled federal leader of the Official Opposition.
From that angle, Ford’s reelection later this year would not necessarily be a bad thing for Trudeau. For as long as the Tories hold Queen’s Park, many of their best and brightest strategists will be content to leave their quarrelsome federal partners to their own devices.
After all, it is not inconvenient for the premier and the prime minister to have each other to blame for whatever messes unfold on their watches. The pandemic conversation has provided examples of that dynamic.
By the same token, the presence at Queen’s Park of a Tory government almost always makes life harder for a federal leader of the Official Opposition of the same stripe.
How does one oppose a national policy that enjoys the support of as high-profile an ally as the premier of Canada’s largest province?
Take child care: By all indications, Ontario is about to join the other provinces and the territories and sign on to Trudeau’s plan.
O’Toole has promised a federal Conservative government would scrap the initiative upon taking office. But if Ford is re-elected, the Ontario Tories will be fully invested in Trudeau’s child-care policy by the time Canada returns to the polls. And that stands to make the current Conservative stance untenable.
As counterintuitive as it may sound, a Progressive Conservative victory in Ontario this spring could go a long way to cement Trudeau’s social policy legacy.

Full text: Let us make a less-than-modest proposal.
The next designated "Let's Talk Day" on mental health should be the day this spring that Premier Doug Ford visits the lieutenant-governor to trigger an Ontario election.
And it should be reprised pretty much every day thereafter until the vote on June 2.
The crisis that is mental-health care in this province should be a paramount issue for those who seek to govern. For the simple reason that it affects just about everything.
What's needed will carry a big price tag. But failure to pay it, failure to rise to a rapidly growing challenge, will cost massively more in the long term in all manner of ways.
It's clear by now that the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic - the lockdowns and protocols imposed to combat it - are washing over us in painful ways and are likely to do so for a generation.
Therapists and counsellors in Ontario and elsewhere have been frantically busy for most of the past two years.
A health-care system that didn't come close to meeting demand even before the pandemic, has been overwhelmed.
As the Star's Nadine Yousif reported this week, the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health's latest national survey showed levels of anxiety, depression and substance use surging along with the Omicron variant's rapid spread.
CAMH psychiatrist Dr. David Gratzer said this wave feels different from earlier ones for many people, as if "the rug has been pulled out from under them after they thought the worst was over.
"I see more pessimism and less resilience than in previous waves," Gratzer added. "Remember, we were already in a mental-health crisis before the pandemic began, and this won't end when the last COVID patient leaves the ICU. For health policy-makers, this is a long-term issue that needs to be addressed right now."
The survey found front-line workers and women were disproportionately struggling with anxiety and depression.
There are obvious reasons, explained Dr. Samantha Wells, a senior director of research at CAMH who helped lead the survey.
"These larger increases among women may reflect that they are often carrying a disproportionate burden, including imbalances in caregiving responsibilities and front-line work," she said.
It's also the case, research has shown, that women have taken the hardest economic hit over the past two years.
Even if someone had been specifically assigned to the task, they would have found it difficult to design a set of circumstances more hazardous to mental well-being than those at play during the pandemic.
It has left people disoriented, isolated and exhausted, with relationships strained and families distressed as they try to cope with disrupted education, perilous work environments, financial uncertainty.
"While people are incredibly resilient, as this pandemic wears on it's the people working on the front lines who are among the most affected," Wells said.
The CAMH study also found a significant increase in reports of unmet mental-health needs, with 24 per cent of those surveyed saying they had been unable to obtain needed services in the last 12 months.
Surprisingly, perhaps, it was those age 18 to 39 - not seniors - who reported the highest levels of moderate to severe anxiety, loneliness and feelings of depression.
And the CAMH survey dealt only with adults. The toll taken on children - with the disruptions to school, athletics, social lives, the lost graduations and proms that normally serve as milestones along the path to maturity - presents a looming wave of mental-health demand.
It's safe to say that without the comfort and consolation of normal relationships, and with trust in institutions and their own futures fractured, the impact of pandemic measures will be long-lasting.
Research suggests, moreover, that the pandemic's mental-health impact is disproportionately affecting those most vulnerable and from more complex circumstances - low-income, Indigenous and racialized groups.
"It has never been more important to invest in mental health to prepare our health-care system for the fallout from this pandemic," said Dr. Hayley Hamilton, the other co-leader of the CAMH survey.
As the impact becomes clear, plans for services and how to fund them should be top of mind for the major challengers in the forthcoming Ontario election.
At core, government is about deciding who gets what, about how to allot finite resources to almost endless demands.
Elections are about deciding who gets to make those decisions.
No party leader who fails to spell out in the coming campaign a comprehensive mental-health program to face this challenge should be entrusted with the privilege.

Martin Regg Cohn: Doug Ford doesn't have a chance as a minority premier

Full text: One after another, Ontario’s opposition party leaders denounced Doug Ford.
Then they did something they hardly ever do.
After first vowing to displace him as premier, they then promised to replace him — by working together, despite their rivalries, after June 2.
It’s rare to see the NDP’s Andrea Horwath appearing at the same event as the Liberals’ Steven Del Duca. It’s almost unheard of to hear them talk of setting aside their bitter competition to co-operate in any future scenario.
But at a Ryerson Democracy Forum that I hosted this week, they tried to answer the overriding question from hundreds of people who watched Tuesday’s event via Zoom: Who can defeat Doug Ford?
They also grappled with the inevitable followup question: Can the New Democrats and Liberals — who can’t seem to stand each other — ever sit down together to work it out and make it work?
In close elections, opposition leaders typically play their cards even closer. But time is running out for politicians to play coy in Ontario.
Where once the rival politicians each would have insisted they are running to be premier and refused to entertain any “hypothetical” scenarios, they are facing facts: After nearly four years in power and two years of pandemic politics, Ford is still remarkably resilient.
His Progressive Conservatives are still leading in most polls. That’s highly unusual for a governing party with voting day barely 18 weeks away — and thanks largely to the New Democrats and Liberals essentially splitting what’s left (and centre) of the vote.
But it’s complicated for Ford’s Tories. They are leading and trailing at the same time.
The latest trend lines, updated this week , show the current premier likely winning the most seats while losing his commanding majority, according to 338Canada.com , the highly respected online “survey of surveys.” When all the votes are counted — not just on election day, but in the legislative non-confidence motion that follows — Ford’s Tories could be unseated if the opposition joins forces.
Which makes it a whole new election. In a minority legislature, no one party can hold power on its own.
And that’s a problem for Ford’s Tories for three simple reasons: The NDP, Liberals and Greens.
All three opposition parties now say they can’t and won’t work with him under any circumstances. And they are publicly confirming that they can, and will, work with each other to form an alternative government.
A formal coalition with cabinet seats for all three parties, or merely an informal voting alliance? Precisely how, they won’t say, but enough said.
“I don’t see any scenario where I would support a Doug Ford government,” Horwath, the leader of Ontario’s Official Opposition, said at the Ryerson event (where, full disclosure, I am a visiting practitioner in the Faculty of Arts).
“If Steven Del Duca is prepared to support the kind of things that we want to see happen to fix what’s wrong in Ontario then I would welcome that and I would be prepared to have that conversation,” she added — reconfirming in a public forum what she had first telegraphed in a Star interview last year .
“I don’t believe that I’ll be able to support Doug Ford,” Del Duca replied when I put the same question to him. “What people want to see in this province is leaders confident enough to work across party lines.”
Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner later echoed that sentiment. “No, I wouldn’t be able to support Mr. Ford,” he said, adding he’d “collaborate and co-operate” with the NDP and Liberals in a minority legislature.
That’s their shared goal. But individually, who has what it takes to be the dragon slayer?
Any fair reading of the polls over the past year — snapshots in time, and in the past, not predictions of the future — shows the New Democrats and Liberals in an ongoing fight for second place, trading places monthly and weekly. Both parties are anxious to persuade voters that their party is best placed to defeat a polarizing premier.
An audience question from Tim Larry put Horwath on the spot: After 13 years and three general election defeats as NDP leader — notably in 2018 when the Liberals were especially vulnerable — this will be her fourth attempt, so what’s the “missing ingredient” needed to “improve” her performance?
What some see as a liability, Horwath calls an opportunity.
“I am the leader right now in this race that knows Ontario the best, I have a great deal of experience, and so I don’t see my time at the helm as something that’s a problem — quite the opposite,” she replied.
Del Duca, who lost his Vaughan seat in the anti-Liberal wave of the last election, recalled how defeat humbled him.
“Look, when you go through the experience that I went through in 2018, when you lose your own seat when there are other challenges that you face in your personal life” — Del Duca lost his brother — “it does definitely change you,” he began. “It gives you that time to reflect …. It’s made me a stronger leader, and a person who is humble enough to know what I don’t know.”
The big unknown is whether these NDP and Liberal antagonists can ever be allies. Watching Del Duca on the Zoom screen, I was reminded of NDP attack ads that use video clips from his news conferences, featuring unflattering close-ups of the Liberal leader blinking.
When I put it to Schreiner — the Green Party leader has a proven knack for getting along with all the parties — he predicted the rivals won’t have any choice.
“Politicians will be compelled to honour what Ontarians have voted for, and in a minority situation, we will be forced to work together,” he said after watching Horwath and Del Duca dance around the question. “I think we need more collaboration and less hyper-partisanship in politics.”
My own take on whether they’d truly co-operate — something they hardly ever do? Only if Ontarians make them.
Clarification — Feb. 10, 2022: This column was edited to remove a suggestion that an NDP ad of Liberal Leader Stephen Del Duca had been edited to show him blinking in slow motion. The NDP said the clip was not edited.

Full text: Phone fight.
The campaign for Ontario’s June 2 election will be contested heavily in the digital arena on smartphones thanks to the uncertainties around COVID-19.
With 14 weeks until the until the writ period begins on May 4, campaign organizers for Progressive Conservative Premier Doug Ford, NDP Leader Andrea Horwath, Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca and Green Leader Mike Schreiner are putting the finishing touches on their strategies and plans.
The New Democrats and Liberals say they are boosting their social media components to complement more traditional campaign elements like leader’s tours, rallies, door-knocking and mainstreeting with voters, turning your phone into a front porch of sorts.
“The ability to door-to-door canvass, particularly in buildings, that is a real challenge,” said Michael Balagus, campaign director for Horwath in her fourth attempt at becoming premier.
“We’re developing all kinds of options to compensate for that. That’s increasing phone banks, increased texting, more social media buys targeted to voters we would normally see on the doorstep.”
Digital outreach is the fast-growing “new reality,” said a Liberal campaign source, speaking confidentially to discuss internal deliberations.
“There’s going to be a significant digital campaign, regardless of the nature of the pandemic at the time.”
Nevertheless, leaders will be out and about, eager to attract eyeballs, interest and engagement with pandemic-weary voters in any way they can, through a digital mask or not.
“Steven Del Duca will travel to every part of Ontario and meet millions of voters in their own communities,” said Liberal campaign director Christine McMillan. “The only thing that will stop us is if Doug Ford’s Conservatives mismanage us back into another lockdown.”
All parties stress they will be following whatever COVID-19 regulations exist at the time.
“We’re planning to be on the road with in-person events and meetings, subject to public health guidelines of course. We will also incorporate virtual meetings and events where possible,” said Darren Elias, press secretary to Green Leader Mike Schreiner.
Organizers have been taking cues from other campaigns across Canada in the last two years, including last September’s federal election.
But the Tories are not tipping their hand as opposition leaders vowed this week not to prop up a Ford-led minority government if that’s what voters send to Queen’s Park.
“We are looking at options and the approach taken both federally and in other provinces, but haven’t made any decisions yet,” said party spokeswoman Stephanie Bellotto.
Breaking with tradition, the PCs did not offer a campaign bus for media in the 2018 election, leaving reporters follow Ford to events on their own. The Liberals and New Democrats did provide buses, charging media outlets about $6,000 per seat to cover the costs.
New Democrats had one bus shared between Horwath’s entourage and journalists, which Balagus said is the likely option again this year. The Liberals had two, one for leader Kathleen Wynne and another for reporters and photographers.
Both parties have buses on their radar again this year for the exposure it gives their leaders.
“It doesn’t really matter to us whether it’s one bus, two buses or a camper van, we’re going to have a leader on the road and a full leader’s tour,” said the Liberal campaign source.

Should non-disclosure agreements be illegal in sexual harassment cases? Some Canadians think so

Full text: Zelda Perkins famously broke a non-disclosure agreement in 2017 and went public about the alleged conduct of her former boss, the now disgraced movie producer and convicted sex offender Harvey Weinstein.
Now she wants to severely limit the use of non-disclosure agreements, or NDAs, and is teaming up with University of Windsor professor emerita of law Julie Macfarlane to press governments to take action.
The two women say NDAs act like gag orders and prevent people, when used for example in cases involving workplace harassment or discrimination, from ever speaking out, even to family members.
“Having the potential to lever money using an NDA is what the problem is at the moment because people are being told they won’t get any compensation unless they sign the NDA,” Macfarlane said.
Legal documents that bar people from sharing information about a particular case or situation, NDAs are commonly used to protect commercial trade secrets and intellectual property.
But where Macfarlane and Perkins have concerns is their use in cases where an NDA can be used to cover up misconduct.
The campaign has been helping politicians craft bills in Canada and abroad. Prince Edward Island became the first province last November to enact legislation and the Manitoba Liberal Party is set to table a similar bill in March. Sen. Marilou McPhedran also intends to introduce a bill in the Senate. A spokesperson for Ontario Attorney General Doug Downey said the government is aware of the PEI bill, but didn’t commit to similar legislation.
On top of lobbying governments to pass legislation, Macfarlane and Perkins have launched a website, cantbuymysilence.com , where they break down the issues around NDAs and present testimonies from individuals who have signed them.
“Yes (Weinstein) was a monster, he’s been punished, and there are enough people calling him out on that,” Perkins said in an interview with the Star, “but to me the bigger monster in the room was the process, the system, and the law that protects these people and is still protecting these people every single day.”
Perkins, a former assistant to Weinstein, signed an NDA in 1998 when she was 24, after she confronted Weinstein over the alleged attempted sexual assault of colleague Rowena Chiu, who also signed an NDA. Both women have since broken them .
Perkins described herself as naive at the time, believing that signing an NDA and getting compensation would mean the conditions set out for Weinstein would be respected, including that he seek therapy and be fired if he ever attempted misconduct again.
“We were only kids, and we were told that that is how you do this,” she said. Perkins has never been pursued legally since breaking the NDA in 2017.
Prince Edward Island’s legislation, which takes effect in May, is similar to a bill being studied in Ireland, where Macfarlane and Perkins’ campaign is providing assistance.
It in most instances removes the possibility of NDAs from settlements. But the bill allows for negotiations for compensation and allows an accuser to request something similar to an NDA under certain conditions, including: they’ve received independent legal advice, the agreement includes a list of people they’re always allowed to speak to, and the agreement isn’t “demonstrably against” the public interest.
“It’s really hard to justify why would we want to silence survivors of misconduct, harassment, discrimination, racism,” said PEI Green Party MLA Lynne Lund, who tabled the bill, in an interview. “It’s really hard to justify how that’s serving anyone’s interests other than perpetrators.”
Lund’s bill was passed unanimously by the PEI legislature. Manitoba Liberal Party Leader Dougald Lamont, whose party only holds three seats in the legislature, said he’s hoping to see similar cross-party support for his party’s bill, to be tabled this spring.
“Fundamentally this is a question of justice, and justice being avoided because people are being forced into silence,” he said.

Full text: Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole admitted Thursday his own personal failings as leader were a contributing factor to his party's loss in the 2021 election.
His comments came after a lengthy caucus meeting where the findings of a wide-ranging internal review of the party's election campaign were presented to MPs and senators.
The report - commissioned by O'Toole - blamed everything from a poisoning of relationships with ethnically diverse communities in the 2015 election campaign to outdated technology as reasons the Tories didn't best the Liberals last summer.
A breakthrough at the polls next time will require breaking down the walls around the party, the review concluded. Among other things, it said that will require free memberships, better outreach to cultural communities, a more diverse roster of candidates, and an authentic and genuine approach from the leader himself.
"There's a lot I had to learn," O'Toole told a news conference Thursday evening. "There's a lot that went well. There's things that didn't."
O'Toole said he heard that he was too scripted in the final days of the campaign, and didn't get out enough to connect with supporters and potential voters.
The review was led by defeated Conservative MP James Cumming. More than 400 people were interviewed and 80 written submissions were accepted in a probe that O'Toole hoped would diffuse some of the anger directed at him for the party's performance.
The complete report is not expected to be made public, but the Star spoke to multiple sources that had been briefed on its contents.
Findings shared with the Star earlier Thursday had noted that the issues the party faced in the 2021 campaign go back farther than the summer of 2020, when O'Toole became leader.
The review found that the party's reputation still suffers with voters because of its proposal during the 2015 federal election campaign to implement a "barbaric cultural practices" telephone hotline and ban the wearing of face coverings during citizenship ceremonies.
The Conservative government of Stephen Harper was defeated in that election, and the report says the party has not been able to recover support it lost in cultural communities as a result of those policies, a source told the Star.
The report also said the party has been locked in leadership races and internal discord since 2015, and that has coloured its reputation in the minds of voters who aren't sure what it represents or stands for.
O'Toole said the Conservatives failed to address some issues that Canadians wanted to hear their policies on, although he did not elaborate, and also failed to showcase issues for Western Canada specifically.
"All of these decisions are my responsibility," he said.
The 2021 election saw the Tories win 119 seats, down two from their total in the 2019 campaign.
While they did pick up some new ridings, including several in the Atlantic Provinces, they lost seats in the Tory heartland of Alberta, as well as MPs in key constituencies in the greater Vancouver and Toronto areas.
One finding shared with MPs Thursday was that efforts by the Tories' rivals to link them with Alberta's provincial government, led by former Conservative cabinet minister Jason Kenney, tarnished their reputation nationally.
Just ahead of the federal election, Alberta had lifted many COVID-19 restrictions despite criticism that the move would put lives in danger. A subsequent surge in cases overwhelmed hospitals, and Kenney later apologized for the decision.
Kenney, who served with O'Toole in the Harper cabinet, was one of his main supporters during the federal party's 2020 leadership contest.
O'Toole won the leadership with a platform he framed as being "true blue" Conservative, but subsequently reversed himself on a number of positions, including a pledge not to implement carbon pricing.
Proposing a carbon-pricing scheme cost support in Alberta, and a mid-campaign muddle on the party's gun policy also drained support there and in urban centres, MPs were told Thursday.
Those policy flip-flops, the seat losses and the failed breakthroughs are among the many factors contributing to unrest among the grassroots and caucus, and ongoing calls for O'Toole to step down.
While he's set to face the membership in a leadership review in 2023, several efforts have sprung up to force an earlier vote, including a petition by a former party councillor, and another by Sen. Denise Batters, a longtime Tory organizer.
Some electoral district associations have now passed motions urging the party to speed up the process.
Two riding associations - one in Alberta, one in Saskatchewan - had already gone public with their motions for an earlier vote. A third in northern Ontario passed its own motion late Wednesday, and others are now mulling a similar approach, multiple sources have told the Star.
While riding associations can pass whatever motions they like, there is no requirement for the party's national council to grant their requests.
As the briefing was underway Thursday, many Conservative MPs were just "rolling their eyes" at the results, one MP told the Star, and wondering whether any changes would actually get made that could set the party on a stronger course for victory.
The idea that free memberships could solve elements of the party's failure to connect was also panned.
"Free memberships are an awful idea. You do not value what you do not pay for," Alberta MP Tom Kmiec wrote on social media. "Party memberships have nothing to do with election campaigns. Election campaigns are about selling ideas, not memberships."

Full text: OTTAWA — Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole admitted Thursday his own personal failings as leader were a contributing factor to his party’s loss in the 2021 election.
His comments came after a lengthy caucus meeting where the findings of a wide-ranging internal review of the party’s election campaign were presented to MPs and senators.
The report — commissioned by O’Toole — blamed everything from a poisoning of relationships with ethnically diverse communities in the 2015 election campaign to outdated technology as reasons the Tories didn’t best the Liberals last summer.

Whether Cumming’s review assuages any of the anger among the grassroots remains to be seen.
“We’ve got a good strong caucus. We’ve been through challenges before, we’re going to get through this one as well,” deputy party leader Candice Bergen told reporters Thursday.

Ford has no chance as a minority premier

Full text: One after another, Ontario's opposition party leaders denounced Doug Ford.
Then they did something they hardly ever do.
After first vowing to displace him as premier, they then promised to replace him - by working together, despite their rivalries, after June 2.
It's rare to see the NDP's Andrea Horwath appearing at the same event as the Liberals' Steven Del Duca. It's almost unheard of to hear them talk of setting aside their bitter competition to co-operate in any future scenario.
But at a Ryerson Democracy Forum that I hosted this week, they tried to answer the overriding question from hundreds of people who watched Tuesday's event via Zoom: Who can defeat Doug Ford?
They also grappled with the inevitable followup question: Can the New Democrats and Liberals - who can't seem to stand each other - ever sit down together to work it out and make it work?
In close elections, opposition leaders typically play their cards even closer. But time is running out for politicians to play coy in Ontario.
Where once the rival politicians each would have insisted they are running to be premier and refused to entertain any "hypothetical" scenarios, they are facing facts: After nearly four years in power and two years of pandemic politics, Ford is still remarkably resilient.
His Progressive Conservatives are still leading in most polls. That's highly unusual for a governing party with voting day barely 18 weeks away - and thanks largely to the New Democrats and Liberals essentially splitting what's left (and centre) of the vote.
But it's complicated for Ford's Tories. They are leading and trailing at the same time.
The latest trend lines, updated this week, show the current premier likely winning the most seats while losing his commanding majority, according to 338Canada.com, the highly respected online "survey of surveys." When all the votes are counted - not just on election day, but in the legislative non-confidence motion that follows - Ford's Tories could be unseated if the opposition joins forces.
Which makes it a whole new election. In a minority legislature, no one party can hold power on its own.
And that's a problem for Ford's Tories for three simple reasons: The NDP, Liberals and Greens.
All three opposition parties now say they can't and won't work with him under any circumstances. And they are publicly confirming that they can, and will, work with each other to form an alternative government.
A formal coalition with cabinet seats for all three parties, or merely an informal voting alliance? Precisely how, they won't say, but enough said.
"I don't see any scenario where I would support a Doug Ford government," Horwath, the leader of Ontario's Official Opposition, said at the Ryerson event (where, full disclosure, I am a visiting practitioner in the Faculty of Arts).
"If Steven Del Duca is prepared to support the kind of things that we want to see happen to fix what's wrong in Ontario then I would welcome that and I would be prepared to have that conversation," she added - reconfirming in a public forum what she had first telegraphed in a Star interview last year.
"I don't believe that I'll be able to support Doug Ford," Del Duca replied when I put the same question to him. "What people want to see in this province is leaders confident enough to work across party lines."
Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner later echoed that sentiment. "No, I wouldn't be able to support Mr. Ford," he said, adding he'd "collaborate and co-operate" with the NDP and Liberals in a minority legislature.
That's their shared goal. But individually, who has what it takes to be the dragon slayer?
Any fair reading of the polls over the past year - snapshots in time, and in the past, not predictions of the future - shows the New Democrats and Liberals in an ongoing fight for second place, trading places monthly and weekly. Both parties are anxious to persuade voters that their party is best placed to defeat a polarizing premier.
An audience question from Tim Larry put Horwath on the spot: After 13 years and three general election defeats as NDP leader - notably in 2018 when the Liberals were especially vulnerable - this will be her fourth attempt, so what's the "missing ingredient" needed to "improve" her performance?
What some see as a liability, Horwath calls an opportunity.
"I am the leader right now in this race that knows Ontario the best, I have a great deal of experience, and so I don't see my time at the helm as something that's a problem - quite the opposite," she replied.
Del Duca, who lost his Vaughan seat in the anti-Liberal wave of the last election, recalled how defeat humbled him.
"Look, when you go through the experience that I went through in 2018, when you lose your own seat when there are other challenges that you face in your personal life" - Del Duca lost his brother - "it does definitely change you," he began. "It gives you that time to reflect .... It's made me a stronger leader, and a person who is humble enough to know what I don't know."
The big unknown is whether these NDP and Liberal antagonists can ever be allies. Watching Del Duca on the Zoom screen, I was reminded of NDP attack ads that use video clips from his news conferences, featuring unflattering close-ups of the Liberal leader blinking in slow motion.
When I put it to Schreiner - the Green Party leader has a proven knack for getting along with all the parties - he predicted the rivals won't have any choice.
"Politicians will be compelled to honour what Ontarians have voted for, and in a minority situation, we will be forced to work together," he said after watching Horwath and Del Duca dance around the question. "I think we need more collaboration and less hyper-partisanship in politics."
My own take on whether they'd truly co-operate - something they hardly ever do? Only if Ontarians make them.

Ontario NDP wants probe into PC party donations and vaccine contract

Full text: Ontario's New Democrats want an investigation into political donations made by board members at a company that was later awarded a government contract to deliver COVID-19 vaccines.
Party ethics critic Taras Natyshak has asked Elections Ontario and the province's auditor general to probe a spate of donations to the Progressive Conservative party from FH Health board members, which was first reported this week in an online news story by Queen's Park Today.
FH Health has been administering vaccines for education workers in the Toronto area and had been offering COVID-19 tests before that.
In a Thursday letter to the CEO of Elections Ontario, Natyshak pointed out that the majority of donations made within the span of a few weeks last year were at the maximum legal limit of $3,300 per person or potentially higher.
He also raised concerns over other donations to the party within the same time frame that appear to have been made by family members or business partners connected to the company, making up a total of $42,000 overall.
"I am very concerned about the potential for these donations to be centrally co-ordinated, either by someone at FH Health or at the PC Party, and the potential for an election finance violation," Natyshak wrote to Greg Essensa.
"I would appreciate your office's prompt investigation into the matter so that Ontarians can be assured such a violation would not be tolerated in Ontario."
The NDP said Elections Ontario had assigned a file number to Natyshak's complaint as of Thursday but said the party hadn't heard back from the auditor general.
Natyshak had written to auditor general Bonnie Lysyk on Wednesday that he was "deeply concerned" about "another sole-sourced contract quickly awarded potentially without proper scrutiny," noting that Lysyk looked into issues with similar contracts in her annual report last year.
He also detailed concerns that the company was only incorporated during the pandemic in the fall of 2020, and questioned why it was selected to deliver vaccines without experience doing so.
"I am asking your office to investigate the selection of this deal with FH Health and how, exactly, Ontarians are on the hook for the contract of another PC-friendly supplier with no discernible history of vaccination provision during this complex and difficult moment of the pandemic," he wrote.
At a Thursday news conference on the matter, Natyshak said the timeline of events surrounding the company and its contract appears "fishy."
"There should be no quid pro quo associated with delivering essential, life-saving measures during a pandemic," he said. "It's egregious and it deserves to be investigated."
A spokesman for Solicitor General Sylvia Jones said the ministry tapped FH Health to run the clinics because the company already had a relationship with Ontario Health and had capacity to get the clinics up and running quickly.
"The Ministry of the Solicitor General entered into an emergency procurement with FH Health to establish additional vaccine clinics - to urgently accelerate boosters for education workers before the return of in-person learning - as they already had physical capacity and Health Human Resources supports in place," Stephen Warner said.
Warner also noted that ministry officials, not Jones, made the decision to enter into the sole-source agreement with the company.
FH Health did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The PC party, meanwhile, said it followed election rules.
"We follow all rules and guidelines set out by Elections Ontario and the Election Finances Act," the party said in an emailed statement.
Green Party of Ontario Leader Mike Schreiner said "decisions about Ontario's pandemic response should not be made based on political donations."
"We need transparency and accountability from our elected officials to build the public trust needed to get through this crisis," he said. "There should have been a transparent and competitive bidding process to get the best outcome for Ontarians."
This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 27, 2022.

Full text: Phone fight.
The campaign for Ontario's June 2 election will be contested heavily in the digital arena on smartphones thanks to the uncertainties around COVID-19.
With 14 weeks until the until the writ period begins on May 4, campaign organizers for Progressive Conservative Premier Doug Ford, NDP Leader Andrea Horwath, Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca and Green Leader Mike Schreiner are putting the finishing touches on their strategies and plans.
The New Democrats and Liberals say they are boosting their social media components to complement more traditional campaign elements like leader's tours, rallies, door-knocking and mainstreeting with voters, turning your phone into a front porch of sorts.
"The ability to door-to-door canvass, particularly in buildings, that is a real challenge," said Michael Balagus, campaign director for Horwath in her fourth attempt at becoming premier.
"We're developing all kinds of options to compensate for that. That's increasing phone banks, increased texting, more social media buys targeted to voters we would normally see on the doorstep."
Digital outreach is the fast-growing "new reality," said a Liberal campaign source, speaking confidentially to discuss internal deliberations. "There's going to be a significant digital campaign, regardless of the nature of the pandemic at the time."
Nevertheless, leaders will be out and about, eager to attract eyeballs, interest and engagement with pandemic-weary voters in any way they can, through a digital mask or not.
"Steven Del Duca will travel to every part of Ontario and meet millions of voters in their own communities," said Liberal campaign director Christine McMillan. "The only thing that will stop us is if Doug Ford's Conservatives mismanage us back into another lockdown."
All parties stress they will be following whatever COVID-19 regulations exist at the time.
"We're planning to be on the road with in-person events and meetings, subject to public health guidelines of course. We will also incorporate virtual meetings and events where possible," said Darren Elias, press secretary to Green Leader Mike Schreiner.
Organizers have been taking cues from other campaigns across Canada in the last two years, including last September's federal election. But the Tories are not tipping their hand as opposition leaders vowed this week not to prop up a Ford-led minority government if that's what voters send to Queen's Park.
"We are looking at options and the approach taken both federally and in other provinces, but haven't made any decisions yet," said party spokeswoman Stephanie Bellotto.
Breaking with tradition, the PCs did not offer a campaign bus for media in the 2018 election, leaving reporters to follow Ford to events on their own. The Liberals and New Democrats did provide buses, charging media outlets about $6,000 per seat to cover the costs.
New Democrats had one bus shared between Horwath's entourage and journalists, which Balagus said is the likely option again this year. The Liberals had two, one for leader Kathleen Wynne and another for reporters and photographers.
Both parties have buses on their radar again this year for the exposure it gives their leaders.
"It doesn't really matter to us whether it's one bus, two buses or a camper van, we're going to have a leader on the road and a full leader's tour," said the Liberal campaign source.

Ontario is right to push back on deal for child care

Full text: This may stop you in your tracks, but I sympathize with Doug Ford's hesitation to sign on to Ottawa's national early learning and child-care program, which has the goal of providing Canadian parents with $10-a-day child care for children younger than six within the next five years.
What we know so far is that Ottawa is offering the province of Ontario $10.2 billion to meet that target. The funding has two main goals: lower costs for parents, and increased access to high-quality, licensed early learning and child care.
So I know how preposterous my position sounds.
After all, I've been arguing non-stop that a lack of high-quality, affordable child care is throttling our ability to bounce back from the pandemic, not just for businesses and our economy as a whole, but for the women who have been trying to do it all, the paid and unpaid work in and outside the home, with more aggravation than help from the province.
So why might stalling an agreement with only 127 days before the next provincial election be reasonable?
Because, simply put, the government of Ontario, or any government in its position, would be setting itself up for failure. It won't be able to meet the required federal targets because the scale of what needs to be done to lower costs and expand high-quality access is enormous.
Most of the federal money would simply go toward lowering the highest parent fees in the country,with little left to add new capacity; a political no-win for politicians who must also address the huge and growing need for more care that the pandemic has unleashed.
A main stumbling block has been that Ontario wants the feds to either give it more money, or acknowledge the care it already provides in full-day kindergarten, which costs the province $3.6 billion annually.
Ottawa did just that in its agreement with Quebec, which will see it provide $6 billion over the next five years, and takes into account the $2.7 billion the province already spends on its child-care system. It makes no sense that Ontario's success in providing early learning and child care to the vast majority of four-year-olds through full-day kindergarten isn't included, because excluding it makes meeting federal access targets unachievable.
So there's merit in Ford's position. And legitimate concerns.
As of Tuesday, every province and territory had signed a deal with the feds except Ontario. Every deal requires that the fees parents pay for licensed/regulated spaces be cut in half by the end of 2022, and average $10 a day in five years.
Ontario had the greatest number of licensed child-care spaces for newborns to five-year-olds anywhere in the country, including Quebec, before the pandemic hit. It's not clear how many still exist.
But with more than 309,270 licensed spaces in Ontario in 2020, the price tag for bringing down parents' costs further, and for more people, will be more expensive here than anywhere.
What gets less air time but is equally key in these deals is that federal funding aims to provide 59 per cent of children aged newborn to five with access to licensed child-care spaces in five years' time.
Why 59 per cent?
Because that was the share of Quebec children aged newborn to five who had access to licensed spaces when Ottawa's strategy was designed, and consequently provides a realistic goal.
In Ontario, only 33 per cent of childrenin this age group had access to licensed child care in 2020. Getting to 59 per cent coverage by 2027 would require adding 204,118 new spaces, requiring a bigger expansion than anywhere else in Canada.
This might require more builds than other jurisdictions if it weren't for what we already excel at in Ontario: full-day kindergarten.
That programming serves 130,000 four-year-olds.
The feds don't want to count it because kindergarten is considered education, and education is a strictly provincial file. But the feds support post-secondary education, and the argument to support preschool, too, is strong - perhaps stronger. This puts junior kindergarten in a different light.
Without doubt, full-day junior kindergarten is qualitatively different from licensed child care. It's totally free to parents. It's in school, so quality controlled. It's guaranteed to be in a neighbourhood near you (with or without free bus service). It builds on existing publicly owned assets, so is cheaper to provide.
But it's only available from 8:30 or 9 a.m. to 3 or 3:30 p.m. Most working parents need longer hours of care.
Still, access to full-day kindergarten has become foundational to our workforce.
In Ontario, 88 per cent of four-year-olds and 92 per cent of five-year-olds are enrolled in full-day kindergarten. That's more than anywhere else in Canada.
Excluding its provision is bewildering, because the feds just signed deals funding movement toward this goal for four-year-olds in Newfoundland and Labrador and in Nova Scotia.
Ontario also requires, by law, that schools provide before-and-after school care if parents ask for it.
Half of Ontario's school boards and 80 per cent of schools offer it, for a fee, though only about a third of four- and five-year-olds are enrolled. That's because the median fee for before-and-after care is $25 a day on a school day, and $42 on non-school days.
Cutting that cost in half for parents by the end of 2022 will mean more parents will ask for before-and-after care, too, requiring more staff and resources.
In any jurisdiction, the quickest route to expanding access to high-quality regulated care for preschoolers is building on our pre-existing, universally accessible infrastructure.
The biggest piece of that puzzle is the public school system, which provides the lowest-cost, best-quality foundation to build on anywhere in Canada. It is already most advanced in Ontario.
Finally, Ontario is the only province where municipalities and regional governments fund, manage and even deliver early learning and child care.
Evidence from Ontario and other provinces shows why schools and local governments provide a real edge in providing quality care: their superior wages and working conditions attract and retain more staff.
A pandemic lesson learned from health care and long-term care is that spaces don't matter if there's no staff.
Across the country, finding enough qualified early childhood educators (ECEs) is challenging because of terrible wages and working conditions.
Provinces like Alberta have deregulated care (both child-staff ratios, and qualifications of caregivers) to increase supply.
Provinces like Nova Scotia have increased programming in pre-kindergarten for four-year-olds, and ECEs who left the field have returned.
Improved wage grids are part of the solution in some but not all federal-provincial deals. It needs to be part of the Ontario deal, if we are going to be able to meet parent expectations and expand. Currently, without lower costs, ECEs often work 12-hour days. This isn't sustainable.
The feds are offering $10.2 billion to reduce parent costs, expand access and improve wages and working conditions in Ontario. If it seems incomprehensible that Ontario hasn't grabbed it, there exist some rational, not political, considerations.
I don't have information about what is happening at the bargaining table, nor insights into the province's logic or strategy.
And boy, is it frustrating for parents, businesses and economists to watch what looks like incompetence or senseless inaction.
But from where I sit, Ontario is right to hold out for now ... until it gets a better deal, and soon.

Full text: No Progressive Conservative majority, no more Premier Doug Ford.
With an election 18 weeks away, that was the message from Ontario’s three opposition party leaders at a Ryerson University Democracy Forum event Tuesday moderated by the Star’s Martin Regg Cohn .
NDP Leader Andrea Horwath, Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca, and Green Leader Mike Schreiner emphasized they would not prop up a Tory minority government led by Ford.
That suggests the premier’s party, which won 76 seats in 2018, must again win a majority of seats in the 124-member legislature on June 2 for him to remain on the job.
Public opinion polls currently indicate a Conservative minority is a likely outcome of the election. The 338Canada polling simulator suggests the Tories would win 59 seats, the Liberals 34, the NDP 30 and the Greens one if the election was held today.
Horwath, whose party now has 40 seats in the house, did not mince words when asked by Cohn about what happens if Ford’s Tories fall short of a majority.
“I don’t see any scenario where I would support a Doug Ford government,” she said firmly on the webinar attended by more than 1,000 people.
“I just don’t have a lot of respect for what he has done in Ontario.”
Emphasizing that Ontarians “want to get off the roller-coaster ride” of the past four years, Horwath expressed a willingness to work with other party leaders to topple Ford.
“If Steven Del Duca is prepared to support the kind of things that we want to see happen to fix what’s wrong in Ontario then I would welcome that and I would be prepared to have that conversation,” she said.
Horwath conceded “that if it’s a matter of working on the things that Ontarians want to see fixed and work on those solutions ... then absolutely I’m prepared to do that work and hope he is,” too.
“But I think the voters have a huge decision to make,” said the NDP leader, who will be contesting her fourth election at the party’s helm since 2009.
Del Duca, for his part, told Cohn the Liberals also could not back a Ford-led PC minority.
“I don’t believe that I’ll be able to support Doug Ford,” he said, noting the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored how much Ontarians would like their politicians to work together.
“What people want to see in this province is leaders confident enough to work across party lines,” said Del Duca, whose party was reduced to seven seats in 2018 after governing Ontario for nearly 15 years.
“Having said that, Doug Ford has demonstrated consistently ... he’s not the right person for the job. He doesn’t have what it takes — not the capacity, the curiosity, the interest or the skill set to get us through to the recovery and rebuild this province,” he said.
Schreiner, who only holds his own seat, said he “just can’t support Doug Ford as premier” given the past four years.
“I’ve never seen a premier so systemically dismantle environmental protections, completely take us backwards on climate action, and just be missing in action when it comes to so many important issues like housing affordability and shoring up our health-care system,” said the Green leader.
“So, no, I wouldn’t be able to support Mr. Ford,” he said, adding he would be willing to “collaborate and co-operate” with Horwath and Del Duca in a minority legislature.
“I absolutely always put people first, ahead of partisan politics. That’s what the people of Ontario want.”

Full text: Ontario’s nurses are getting the ear of Premier Doug Ford as the province approaches the two year mark of a pandemic that has left them frustrated, exhausted and burned out.
Ford and Health Minister Christine Elliott have agreed to meet with the Ontario Nurses’ Association (ONA) and its president Cathryn Hoy on Feb. 3, after a letter turning down a meeting was sent “in error,” the premier’s office said Tuesday.
Hoy said she wants changes to legislation that caps wage increases for nurses , and other public sector workers, at one per cent and emergency powers that allow employers to alter nurses’ work schedules with “very little notice” often leaving them with child-care problems or cancelled vacations.
The concerns have been publicly telegraphed by nurses but a meeting means they can be explained one-on-one to the premier with just over four months to go until the June 2 Ontario election.
“Our members are burned out and they’re at the breaking point,” said Hoy, who noted movement on Bill 124 wage caps would send an important signal to nurses that their sacrifices and hard work during COVID-19 have been recognized.
“If he dropped Bill 124 and wanted to negotiate I’d have a team together within 72 hours and ready to bargain,” Hoy told the Star. “Bill 124 is a lot about respect.”
Easing nursing shortages and workloads is also expected to be part of any discussions. ONA, the country’s largest nurses’ union with 68,000 members, wants to see the number of full-time hospital nurses boosted to 70 per cent, up from 50 per cent now.
When the ONA tweeted Monday that the premier’s office had declined a meeting citing his “extremely demanding schedule,” there was a flurry of criticism on social media.
“Obviously we want to hear from the ONA and we hope it will be a constructive conversation,” said Ford spokeswoman Ivana Yelich, acknowledging “the ongoing staffing shortages and what nurses are dealing with on the front lines.”
Hoy said she doesn’t understand why it took so long to get a meeting, particularly when Ford had time to help stuck motorists a week ago Monday in a snowstorm, as captured on live TV .
“If you can be driving and talking on your cellphone and shovelling snow, I would think that health care … would have been made a priority.”

$10-a-day child-care deal for Ontario is 'very, very close,' Doug Ford says

Full text: A “confident” Premier Doug Ford says a deal with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to deliver $10-a-day child care to Ontario families is “very, very close.”
In the wake of an exclusive story in the Star that disclosed an agreement is imminent, Ford was asked Tuesday on a Kenora radio station if Ontarians could “be assured it is coming” now that every other province and territory has signed on.
“Yeah, you can be assured,” the premier told hosts Kim Leduc and Ken O’Neil on Q104 .
“We’ve been going back and forth with the federal government. We’ve had great discussions, but I’m a business person. I’m not going to make a deal just for making a deal and we get shortchanged,” he said.
“We’re going to make sure that the federal government is a true partner. Not one-time funding. Not ‘here’s enough money for five years and then we’re taking off.’”
Emphasizing “we need consistent funding from the federal government” to keep affordable child care sustainable, Ford said negotiations with Ottawa have been fruitful.
“We’re very, very close. I’m confident we’re going to strike a deal that’s going to be beneficial for everyone in Ontario,” he said.
“We’ll get there as sure as I’m talking to you.”
With Ontario the lone holdout to sign on to a federal funding plan after Nunavut unveiled its agreement Monday, pressure has been mounting on Ford.
Ottawa and Queen’s Park have been in discussions for months about a federal plan that would give Ontario $10.2 billion to expand licensed non-profit child-care spaces, cutting average fees in half by the end of this year, and lead to $10-a-day care within five years.
As Ford stressed on Q104, the only remaining impediment is how long Ottawa would keep up its end of the bargain after the five-year deal expires.
Sources say federal officials have tried to allay those fears by proposing to either extend the length of the accord or to review funding after the third or fifth year of the agreement.
Queen’s Park is concerned funding for the program could dwindle under a future federal government. Provincial officials note that federal health transfer payments have declined from a 50-50 split decades ago to a 22 per cent share from Ottawa with the provinces footing the rest of the tab.
A senior federal official, speaking confidentially in order to discuss internal deliberations, insisted no federal government of any political stripe is likely to gut or cancel an established program that helps women enter the workforce and fuels economic growth.
Although federal Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole has vowed to scrap the $30-billion program — and give families up to $6,000 a year via a refundable tax credit instead — provincial Tory governments across the country have embraced the signature campaign pledge from Trudeau’s Liberals.
With Ford’s Tories facing voters in the June 2 election — and all provincial opposition parties endorsing the $10-a-day child care plan — there has been pressure for Ontario to sign.

Full text: Ottawa and Queen’s Park are “very close” to a deal on $10-a-day child care, the Star has learned.
With Ontario the lone holdout province or territory to sign on to a federal funding plan after Nunavut unveiled its agreement Monday, pressure has been mounting on Premier Doug Ford.
“We’re very close. I expect a deal to be finalized shortly,” a Ford confidant told the Star hours after the Nunavut accord was made public.
“We are closer than ever before to a national early learning and child-care program,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said as he unveiled a $66-million deal with Nunavut on Monday.
“This is a game-changer for so many families to see child-care fees cut in half by the end of this year.”
Trudeau said fee reductions and rebates announced by provinces are already putting child-care savings in the pockets of families in Nova Scotia, Alberta, Prince Edward Island and Saskatchewan.
For months, Queen’s Park and the federal government have debated the broad strokes of a program that would give Ontario $10.2 billion to expand licensed non-profit child-care spaces, slash average fees in half by the end of this year, and provide $10-a-day daycare within five years.
“We very much hope that the Ontario government decides that it is in both their interests and mostly the interests of Ontarian families to move forward,” he said.
“The federal money is there. We just need the government of Ontario to move forward.”
Ontario initially argued its $3.6 billion spending on junior and senior kindergarten for children ages four and five should be covered, and its for-profit providers should be included — all objections Ottawa has countered or met, and are no longer impediments.
Now the real logjam is over just how long Ottawa would keep up its end of the funding bargain after the five-year deal it is offering expires, federal and provincial sources told the Star.
Federal officials say Ottawa has tried to allay those fears, proposing to either extend the life of the agreement, or to review funding at year three or five to ensure it continues to meet the province’s needs.
Ford’s government worries that funding for the program would decline, just as federal health transfers have declined from a 50-50 split decades ago to a 22 per cent federal share, leaving the province holding the bag on an expensive social program.
A senior federal official, speaking on background, said no federal government of any political stripe is likely to gut or cancel an established program that helps women enter the workforce and fuels economic growth.
It’s clear Ford’s Progressive Conservatives don’t hold the same ideological objection as the federal Tories, whose leader Erin O’Toole has pledged to scrap the $30-billion program altogether.
In its place, O’Toole has proposed to give families up to $6,000 a year via a refundable tax credit instead of expanding regulated non-profit child-care spaces.
But Ford’s government wants to take advantage of the federal program offer, and is working through details in talks between officials that were expected to run throughout the week.
“We’ve been working very hard to get a fair deal for Ontario families because we know child care is too expensive,” said Education Minister Stephen Lecce.
“It is inaccessible to too many families in Ontario. That just simply is unacceptable.”
Lecce noted talks are progressing toward an accord that “is fiscally sustainable, that actually gets prices down to $10 a day, that ensures women can get back to the labour market and support our economic recovery.
“They continue this week — as they have over the past weeks — with the single aim of a fair deal for Ontario families that reduces costs and increases access to spaces in all communities of the province.”
A senior provincial government official emphasized there is “continued optimism” a deal can be struck with Ottawa.
“The meetings have been constructive,” said the high-ranking insider, speaking confidentially in order to discuss internal deliberations.
“If this lowers the cost of daycare for families, it’s the right thing to do,” said the official, emphasizing Ontario’s regulated hybrid of public and private child care is “complex” so negotiations are painstaking.
“Both sides want to get it right. Both sides are looking very carefully at what the elements of a deal would look like. It’s a long-term, major new social program so the parameters have to be in place to ensure it is sustainable,” added the insider.
“We’re optimistic we’re on a good path with the federal government.”
With an Ontario election set for June 2, the opposition parties want the Progressive Conservatives to strike a deal soon.
NDP Leader Andrea Horwath and NDP MPP Bhutila Karpoche (Parkdale-High Park) urged the Tories to move.
“Ford should have relieved the sting of high child-care prices months ago, saving families thousands this winter,” the New Democrats said in a joint statement.
“Families in Ontario continue to be crushed by Ontario’s massive child-care fees,” they said. “Doug Ford’s refusal to make parents and young families a priority means that parents are paying $2,000 a month or more in fees while families in every other jurisdiction in the country are paying as low as $10-a-day.”
Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca has warned that the Tories’ inability to achieve an agreement like every other province and territory will be an issue in the upcoming Ontario election.
Green Leader Mike Schreiner said “Ford continues to fail Ontario families on affordability.”
“Ten-dollar-a-day child care is there for the taking, but the Ford government is dragging its heels,” said Schreiner.

Send more COVID-19 vaccine doses to poor countries, Liberal MP tells Trudeau government

Full text: OTTAWA—A Liberal MP from Toronto is calling on the federal government to redouble its efforts to share COVID-19 vaccines with poorer countries, arguing it is past time Canada and other rich nations learn one lesson from the Omicron surge: the whole world needs shots as soon as possible.
Beaches—East York MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith provided the Star on Monday with the text of a new motion he intends to table in Parliament after the House of Commons returns on Jan 31.
The motion calls on the Liberal government to devote another $1.1 billion to the fair global distribution of COVID-19 vaccine doses, including $780 million — on top of the $1.3 billion Canada has already pledged — to the ACT-Accelerator, an initiative launched by the World Health Organization to share COVID shots, treatments and tests around the world.
The motion also seeks $290 million in aid to help countries defend against the pandemic and deliver vaccines.
Erskine-Smith also wants Canada to speed up deliveries of the 200 million doses it has promised by the end of 2022 to the ACT-Accelerator’s COVAX program, which is meant to “guarantee fair and equitable access” to COVID-19 shots for all countries.
He described the proposals as the fulfilment of a “moral obligation” to poorer countries, as well as a “matter of self-interest” to try to prevent another variant such as Omicron from emerging in countries where populations don’t have access to the same number of shots.
According to data compiled by the One Campaign, an international organization devoted to fighting poverty and disease that helped Erskine-Smith craft his motion, only around 10 per cent of people in Africa — the world’s poorest continent , per capita — are fully vaccinated with two doses against COVID-19.
In Canada, as of Jan. 21, more than 77 per cent of the total population had received at least two doses, according to the federal government.
“Canada has played a leading role in global efforts, but those global efforts have been mediocre and underwhelming and insufficient,” Erskine-Smith said by phone on Monday.
“We’re spending hundreds of billions of dollars on our own domestic pandemic response,” he added. “We can spend a fraction of what we spent to protect the world and protect ourselves.”
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said repeatedly throughout the pandemic — echoing the statements of health experts and the WHO — that the crisis won’t be over in Canada until it ends around the world. Trudeau’s government says it has pledged $1.3 billion to the ACT-Accelerator so far, making it one of the top contributors , according to the WHO’s website.
Erskine-Smith isn’t alone in calling for more. The New Democrats also want the federal government to push countries to waive intellectual property rights to COVID-19 vaccines so that they can be produced more broadly. In an open letter to Trudeau in December, the Canadian Public Health Association also called for those rights to be waived and do more to ensure timely provision of shots to poorer countries.
“This is a call to arms for the government to say we can do more, we should do more,” Erskine-Smith said of his upcoming motion in the House.
“We should look back on this time and see that Canada played a leading role in addressing global vaccine equity.”

Full text: No Progressive Conservative majority, no more Premier Doug Ford.
With an election 18 weeks away, that was the message from Ontario's three opposition party leaders at a Ryerson University Democracy Forum event Tuesday moderated by the Star's Martin Regg Cohn.
NDP Leader Andrea Horwath, Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca and Green Leader Mike Schreiner emphasized they would not prop up a Tory minority government led by Ford.
That suggests the premier's party, which won 76 seats in 2018, must again win a majority of seats in the 124-member legislature on June 2 for him to remain on the job.
Public opinion polls currently indicate a Conservative minority is a likely outcome of the election. The 338Canada polling simulator suggests the Tories would win 59 seats, the Liberals 34, the NDP 30 and the Greens one if the election was held today.
Horwath, whose party now has 40 seats in the house, did not mince words when asked by Cohn about what happens if Ford's Tories fall short of a majority.
"I don't see any scenario where I would support a Doug Ford government," she said firmly on the webinar attended by more than 1,000 people.
"I just don't have a lot of respect for what he has done in Ontario."
Emphasizing that Ontarians "want to get off the roller-coaster ride" of the past four years, Horwath expressed a willingness to work with other party leaders to topple Ford.
"If Steven Del Duca is prepared to support the kind of things that we want to see happen to fix what's wrong in Ontario then I would welcome that and I would be prepared to have that conversation," she said.
Horwath conceded "that if it's a matter of working on the things that Ontarians want to see fixed and work on those solutions ... then absolutely I'm prepared to do that work and hope he is" too.
"But I think the voters have a huge decision to make," said the NDP leader, who will be contesting her fourth election at the party's helm since 2009.
Del Duca, for his part, told Cohn the Liberals also could not back a Ford-led PC minority.
"I don't believe that I'll be able to support Doug Ford," he said, noting the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored how much Ontarians would like their politicians to work together.
"What people want to see in this province is leaders confident enough to work across party lines," said Del Duca, whose party was reduced to seven seats in 2018 after governing Ontario for nearly 15 years.
"Having said that, Doug Ford has demonstrated consistently ... he's not the right person for the job. He doesn't have what it takes - not the capacity, the curiosity, the interest or the skill set to get us through to the recovery and rebuild this province," he said.
Schreiner, who holds his party's only seat, said he "just can't support Doug Ford as premier" given the past four years.
"I've never seen a premier so systemically dismantle environmental protections, completely take us backwards on climate action, and just be missing in action when it comes to so many important issues like housing affordability and shoring up our health-care system," said the Green leader.
"So, no, I wouldn't be able to support Mr. Ford," he said, adding he would be willing to "collaborate and co-operate" with Horwath and Del Duca in a minority legislature.
"I absolutely always put people first, ahead of partisan politics. That's what the people of Ontario want."
CAPTION: The consensus from Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner, left, NDP Leader Andrea Horwath and Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca suggests Doug Ford's party, which won 76 seats in 2018, must again win a majority of seats in the 124-member legislature on June 2 for him to remain on the job.Toronto Star file photos

Full text: Ottawa and Queen's Park are "very close" to a deal on $10-a-day child care, the Star has learned.
With Ontario the lone holdout province or territory to sign on to a federal funding plan after Nunavut unveiled its agreement Monday, pressure has been mounting on Premier Doug Ford.
"We're very close. I expect a deal to be finalized shortly," a Ford confidant told the Star hours after the Nunavut accord was made public.
"We are closer than ever before to a national early learning and child-care program," Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said as he unveiled a $66-million deal with Nunavut on Monday.
"This is a game-changer for so many families to see child-care fees cut in half by the end of this year."
Trudeau said fee reductions and rebates announced by provinces are already putting child-care savings in the pockets of families in Nova Scotia, Alberta, Prince Edward Island and Saskatchewan.
For months, Queen's Park and the federal government have debated the broad strokes of a program that would give Ontario $10.2 billion to expand licensed non-profit child-care spaces, slash average fees in half by the end of this year, and provide $10-a-day daycare within five years.
"We very much hope that the Ontario government decides that it is in both their interests and mostly the interests of Ontarian families to move forward," he said.
"The federal money is there. We just need the government of Ontario to move forward."
Ontario initially argued its $3.6-billion spending on junior and senior kindergarten for children ages four and five should be covered, and its for-profit providers should be included - all objections that Ottawa has countered or met, and are no longer impediments.
Now the real logjam is over just how long Ottawa would keep up its end of the funding bargain after the five-year deal it is offering expires, federal and provincial sources told the Star.
Federal officials say Ottawa has tried to allay those fears, proposing to either extend the life of the agreement, or to review funding at year three or five to ensure it continues to meet the province's needs.
Ford's government worries that funding for the program would decline, just as federal health transfers have declined from a 50-50 split decades ago to a 22 per cent federal share, leaving the province holding the bag on an expensive social program.
A senior federal official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said no federal government of any political stripe is likely to gut or cancel an established program that helps women enter the workforce and fuels economic growth.
It's clear Ford's Progressive Conservatives don't hold the same ideological objection as the federal Tories, whose leader Erin O'Toole has pledged to scrap the $30-billion program altogether.
In its place, O'Toole has proposed to give families up to $6,000 a year via a refundable tax credit instead of expanding regulated non-profit child-care spaces.
But Ford's government wants to take advantage of the federal program offer, and is working through details in talks between officials that were expected to run throughout the week.
"We've been working very hard to get a fair deal for Ontario families because we know child care is too expensive," said Education Minister Stephen Lecce.
"It is inaccessible to too many families in Ontario. That just simply is unacceptable."
Lecce noted talks are progressing toward an accord that "is fiscally sustainable, that actually gets prices down to $10 a day, that ensures women can get back to the labour market and support our economic recovery.
"They continue this week - as they have over the past weeks - with the single aim of a fair deal for Ontario families that reduces costs and increases access to spaces in all communities of the province."
A senior provincial government official emphasized there is "continued optimism" a deal can be struck with Ottawa.
"The meetings have been constructive," said the high-ranking insider, speaking confidentially in order to discuss internal deliberations.
"If this lowers the cost of daycare for families, it's the right thing to do," said the official, emphasizing Ontario's regulated hybrid of public and private child care is "complex" so negotiations are painstaking.
"Both sides want to get it right. Both sides are looking very carefully at what the elements of a deal would look like. It's a long-term, major new social program so the parameters have to be in place to ensure it is sustainable," added the insider.
"We're optimistic we're on a good path with the federal government."
With an Ontario election set for June 2, the opposition parties want the Progressive Conservatives to strike a deal soon.
New Democratic Party Leader Andrea Horwath and NDP MPP Bhutila Karpoche (Parkdale-High Park) urged the Tories to move.
"Ford should have relieved the sting of high child-care prices months ago, saving families thousands this winter," the New Democrats said in a joint statement.
"Families in Ontario continue to be crushed by Ontario's massive child-care fees," they said. "Doug Ford's refusal to make parents and young families a priority means that parents are paying $2,000 a month or more in fees while families in every other jurisdiction in the country are paying as low as $10 a day."
Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca has warned that the Tories' inability to achieve an agreement like every other province and territory will be an issue in the upcoming Ontario election.
Green Leader Mike Schreiner said "Ford continues to fail Ontario families on affordability."

Full text: The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Tuesday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available.
7 p.m.: The COVID-19 booster drive in the U.S. is losing steam, worrying health experts who have pleaded with Americans to get an extra shot to shore up their protection against the highly contagious omicron variant.
Just 40% of fully vaccinated Americans have received a booster dose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And the average number of booster shots dispensed per day in the U.S. has plummeted from a peak of 1 million in early December to about 490,000 as of last week.
Also, a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that Americans are more likely to see the initial vaccinations — rather than a booster — as essential.
“It’s clear that the booster effort is falling short,” said Jason Schwartz, a vaccine policy expert at Yale University.
Overall, the U.S. vaccination campaign has been sluggish. More than 13 months after it began, just 63% of Americans, or 210 million people, are fully vaccinated with the initial rounds of shots. Mandates that could raise those numbers have been hobbled by legal challenges.
Vaccination numbers are stagnant in states such as Wyoming, Idaho, Mississippi and Alabama, which have been hovering below 50%.
In Wyoming, 44% are fully vaccinated, up just slightly from 41% in September. To boost numbers, the state has been running TV ads with health care workers giving grim accounts of unvaccinated people struggling with COVID-19.
6:52 p.m.: Alberta Health Services says a patient has died while waiting for care in an emergency ward.
AHS spokesman Kerry Williamson says the patient had been triaged at the Red Deer Regional Hospital and reassessed by emergency staff Sunday, but died before receiving further care.
The emergency department was fully staffed at the time.
Health Minister Jason Copping announced new measures on Monday to free up ambulances and reduce long wait times in hospital ERs due to high COVID-19 caseloads and staff shortages due to illness
Williamson says the death is being investigated and it’s not yet known whether it was the result of a long wait.
Alberta has a record 1,377 people in hospital with COVID-19.
Copping says while the Omicron wave of the pandemic appears to be receding, hospitalizations are still expected to increase in the short term.
6:30 p.m.: British Columbia’s vaccine card program is being extended until the end of June.
Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry says the government is trying to mitigate the risks of spreading COVID-19 and the vaccine card is specifically designed to allow certain businesses and activities to remain open.
She says the province will re-examine the proposed end date if conditions improve.
While the number of COVID-19 infections is dipping, Henry says hospitalizations are at the highest point of the pandemic.
B.C.’s vaccine card, which shows proof of vaccination for those 12 years and older, is used to access restaurants, indoor events, fitness centres and other facilities.
5:30 p.m.: The Quebec government announced the loosening of some COVID-19 restrictions Tuesday, following the lead of Ontario and other provinces amid indications the Omicron surge may be peaking in some areas.
Quebec Premier François Legault said the province would adopt a go-slow approach, which will see gathering limits raised on Monday for private functions, as well as the reopening of restaurants at 50 per cent capacity and a resumption of some sports activities for those under 18. Other restrictions will be eased for religious, entertainment and sports venues on Feb. 7.
“We are all aware that a lot of Quebecers are fed up, they’re fed up with the restrictions,” Legault told a news conference in Montreal. But he added that any reopening has to be cautious and gradual. “We have to take it easy,” he said.
Last Thursday, the Ontario government confirmed it would start easing health protection orders by boosting the size of social gatherings and reopening businesses such as restaurants, gyms and cinemas with capacity limits — part of a plan to lift all constraints by mid-March.
Premier Doug Ford said the phased reopening was in response to public health indicators showing “that the worst is behind us.” The premier pointed to a reduced rate of hospital admissions and a declining percentage of positive COVID-19 tests.
The number of people with COVID-19 in Ontario hospitals, however, went up Tuesday to 4,008 from 3,861 on Monday. The number of people in intensive care also rose slightly to 626 from 615 — and the province reported 64 new deaths. Ford said Tuesday he doesn’t see the province’s mask mandates ending anytime soon.
In Quebec, health officials reported 85 more deaths linked to COVID-19, and the province’s Health Department reported that hospitalizations fell by 21, to 3,278. The number of people in intensive care remained unchanged at 263.
4:40 p.m.: Nova Scotia is reporting five more COVID-19-related deaths today and 492 new lab-confirmed cases.
Health officials say four people died of the disease in the Halifax area and a woman in her 80s died in the province’s eastern zone.
Officials had also reported five COVID-19 deaths on Monday.
Nova Scotia has reported a total of 136 COVID-19 deaths since the start of the pandemic.
There are 92 people in hospital who were admitted because of COVID-19 and who are receiving care in specialized units, including 15 in intensive care.
Officials estimate there are 4,250 active cases of COVID-19 in the province.
4:24 p.m.: The Greater Toronto Hockey League says on-ice programming will resume starting Jan. 31. The league says facilities can reopen with half the capacity “in both the building and spectator areas.”
This means the league’s A, AA and AAA competitive teams, along with the Mississauga Hockey League, North York Hockey League and others can start practicing again Jan. 31.
“This will allow a period of time for players to return to physical activity before participating in game situations,” the league said in a statement Tuesday afternoon.
Games can begin on Feb. 4.
3:52 p.m.: Haiti is fighting a rise in COVID-19 cases as the government struggles to convince people to get vaccinated, the country’s health minister told The Associated Press on Tuesday.
The country of 11 million people has reported more than 28,500 confirmed cases and 780 deaths, although experts say they believe the numbers are underreported given the widespread lack of testing.
According to the World Health Organization, more than 204,900 vaccine doses have been administered in Haiti, but the local government notes that only some 75,500 people have received two doses, with no boosters yet given.
“Unfortunately, the population showed no enthusiasm. ... We live in a land of non-believers,” said Lauré Adrien, general director of Haiti’s Ministry of Health. “The vaccination campaign is progressing slowly, not at the desired pace.”
He said another problem is that some health centers have no vaccines while others have a surplus that goes unused.
“We are working hard to better manage demand and ensure that inventory is used efficiently and equitably,” he said.
Up until mid-July of last year, Haiti was the only country in the Americas that had not received a single vaccine dose.
Adrien said he believes the omicron variant is present but said he was unable to provide any proof because Haiti does not have the required laboratories or resources to carry out that kind of specific testing.
Instead, he said the government is forced to send a small group of samples to Brazil to test for the omicron variant and that it takes a long time to obtain the results. He added that samples taken from people believed to be infected in December and January are still being processed.
3:28 p.m.: Authorities in the United Arab Emirates have published new information about the capital’s entry requirements, saying that unlike residents and citizens, vaccinated tourists do not need to show proof of a booster shot to cross into Abu Dhabi.
The tourism-specific change comes as confusion swirls around entry rules for Abu Dhabi, which has taken a more stringent approach to containing the coronavirus than its freewheeling neighbor, Dubai.
The pandemic has prompted Abu Dhabi to erect a hard border with Dubai, forcing all drivers to come to a halt for vaccination and COVID checks on what once had been a wide, empty highway before the virus struck.
Ever-changing requirements have caused some headaches for commuters, with drivers from Dubai who had not received booster shots unexpectedly turned away from the capital last week. The emirate later clarified that all citizens and residents seeking entry must now show proof of a booster shot to be considered fully vaccinated and maintain a “green status” on the government health app.
The updated Abu Dhabi tourism website now says that the new rule does not apply to international visitors, who may enter the city-state if they have received both doses. State media reported the update on Monday.
All visitors also must present a recent negative virus test to gain entry to the capital and to its public places, including malls and gyms. Residents must have taken the test within the last two weeks. Tourists must test negative before departure and on arrival.
Infections have surged in the UAE in recent weeks fueled by the spread of the highly contagious omicron variant.
3:09 p.m. Ontario Premier Doug Ford says he doesn’t see the province’s mask mandates ending anytime soon.
Ford was speaking with Belleville radio station CJBQ today and was asked about his recently announced plan to start easing COVID-19 restrictions.
The premier said he can’t stand shutdowns and wants to get back to normal, but wants to do it properly and cautiously, which is why there will be at least 21 days between each reopening phase.
When asked if a mask mandate will be lifted, Ford said he couldn’t say that it will be anytime soon.
He says it really protects people, though it won’t be in place forever.
3:02 p.m. Mary Fraser-Hamilton spent part of last week sitting in her car instead of teaching in her classroom.
The Brampton, Ont., drama teacher was one of 11 education workers in Ontario who initiated work refusals over COVID-19 safety concerns as students and staff members returned to in-person learning with less transparency about the virus in schools.
Teachers say they’re concerned about lack of information on cases now that the province has cut back on testing and contact tracing, as well as ventilation standards and student mask quality. They consider individual labour action one of the last options they have to advocate for stronger safety standards in schools — but remain worried that student safety issues are falling through the cracks.
“We aren’t organizing or anything. We’re all just fed up,” Fraser-Hamilton said in an interview.
2:57 p.m. Yukon’s education minister says the territory will no longer be issuing COVID-19 exposure notifications at schools.
Jeanie McLean says the Yukon Centre for Disease Control is monitoring class attendance in an effort to ensure children are safe at schools.
She says keeping schools open is a top priority for the territory, although she acknowledged the stress on staff in making sure schools are safe and remain operating.
2:56 p.m. Quebec Premier François Legault announced Tuesday that restaurant dining rooms in the province will be able to reopen next week as part of a gradual easing of COVID-19 measures that have been in place since December.
“I told you last week that we were seeing the light at the end of the tunnel,” Legault told a news conference in Montreal. “I think we can say today that we are out of the tunnel.”
He cautioned, however, that the province’s health system is “in rough shape” and it will take time to build the hospital capacity the province needs.
As of Monday, restaurants in Quebec will be able to welcome diners, with capacity limited to 50 per cent and no more than four people from different households at a table.
The premier said restrictions on private gatherings will also be loosened, with gatherings of up to four people, or two family bubbles, permitted. Also beginning Monday, school and youth sports will be allowed to resume.
2 p.m. New Brunswick’s chief medical officer of health says that while hospitalizations continue to rise, they are below original projections, which indicates people have responded to the call to reduce their contacts.
Dr. Jennifer Russell confirmed there are 138 people hospitalized with COVID-19 today — an increase of seven from Monday.
There are 11 people in intensive care and three people on ventilators.
In a statement, Russell said three more people have died as a result of COVID-19.
2 p.m. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis vowed Tuesday to fight a decision from federal health regulators to block two coronavirus antibody treatments after the drugs were found to be ineffective against the widespread Omicron variant.
The Republican governor’s comments come a day after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration moved to revoke emergency authorization for antibody drugs from Regeneron and Eli Lilly. The drugs, which were purchased by the federal government and administered to millions of Americans, had become a centerpiece of DeSantis’ coronavirus response as he resisted vaccine mandates and other safety measures. The governor did not elaborate on how he plans to oppose to the FDA decision.
The FDA announcement was expected, as both drugmakers have said the treatments are less able to target omicron because of its mutations. In updated drug labeling released Monday, the FDA said omicron appears 1,000-fold less vulnerable to Regeneron’s drug and nearly 3,000-fold less vulnerable to Lilly’s drug.
1:45 p.m. A federal appeals court on Tuesday allowed the state to enforce a law that prevents local schools from imposing mask mandates, but the court also allowed a group of parents of disabled children to pursue a lawsuit that seeks to strike down the law.
Two members of a three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Omaha found a previous federal judge’s decision that blocked the state ban on mask mandates was too broad. They sided with the parents and a disability rights group in concluding that their lawsuit can proceed in federal court.
The panel found the parents likely will succeed because mask requirements constitute a reasonable modification and schools’ failure to provide this accommodation likely violates the federal Rehabilitation Act.
1:35 p.m. The “partygate” scandal that threatens to derail U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s administration deepened Tuesday as police opened an investigation into gatherings at government offices that allegedly violated COVID-19 lockdown rules.
London’s Metropolitan Police Service has launched an inquiry into “a number of events” at Johnson’s Downing Street office and other government buildings because they met the force’s criteria for investigating the “most serious and flagrant” breaches of coronavirus rules, Commissioner Cressida Dick told a committee of the London Assembly, the capital’s local government council.
Johnson is facing calls to resign amid revelations that he or his staff attended a series of social events during periods of lockdown when most social gatherings were banned in England, forcing average citizens to miss weddings, funerals and birthdays as friends and relatives died alone in hospitals. The gatherings are already being investigated by a senior civil servant whose report has been anxiously awaited by lawmakers and the public.
1:07 p.m. GoFundMe has frozen the nearly $4.5 million in funds raised by the trucker convoy now wending its way across the country toward Ottawa in a protest against vaccine mandates.
“We require that fundraisers be transparent about the flow of funds and have a clear plan for how those funds will be spent. In this case, we are in touch with the organizer to verify that information,” Rachel Hollis, a spokeswoman for the crowdfunding platform, said in an email.
“Funds will be safely held until the organizer is able to provide the documentation to our team about how funds will be properly distributed.”
12:57 p.m. Anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., apologized Tuesday for suggesting things are worse for people today than they were for Anne Frank, the teenager who died in a Nazi concentration camp after hiding with her family in a secret annex in an Amsterdam house for two years.
Kennedy’s comments, made at a Washington rally on Sunday put on by his anti-vaccine nonprofit group, were widely condemned as offensive, outrageous and historically ignorant. It’s the second time since 2015 that Kennedy has apologized for referencing the Holocaust during his work sowing doubt and distrust about vaccines.
“I apologize for my reference to Anne Frank, especially to families that suffered the Holocaust horrors,” Kennedy said in a tweet Tuesday morning. “My intention was to use examples of past barbarism to show the perils from new technologies of control. To the extent my remarks caused hurt, I am truly and deeply sorry.”
12:30 p.m. Russian health authorities have shortened the required isolation period for those who come in contact with COVID-19 patients from 14 days to seven, a move that comes as an unprecedented surge of coronavirus infections, driven by the highly contagious Omicron variant, rips through the vast country.
Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin announced the degree Tuesday. It only changes the rules for those who had close contact with someone who has COVID-19, not for those with a confirmed infection. Those who test positive are still required to isolate for 14 days, with a mandatory test on day 10 or 11.
Daily new infections in Russia have been rising sharply for the past two weeks, increasing more than four-fold — from about 15,000 on Jan. 10 to 67,809 on Tuesday, the highest daily tally in the pandemic.
12 p.m. Quebec is reporting 85 more deaths linked to COVID-19 ahead of an update later Tuesday by Premier François Legault.
The Health Department says hospitalizations fell by 21, to 3,278, after 272 people entered hospital and 293 were checked out.
The number of people in intensive care remained unchanged at 263.
Quebec is also reporting 2,977 new cases of COVID-19, but officials say the number isn’t representative of the situation because testing is limited to high-priority groups.
11:50 a.m. In a Tuesday presser, Mayor John Tory says another vaccine clinic will be held on Jan. 31 from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. at Metro Toronto Convention Centre.
The “physically accessible, super supportive” clinic is meant for those with challenges, including wheelchair users, those afraid of needles and others.
11:45 a.m. MiWay will be restoring service on Route 110 University Express as in-person learning and work activities at the University of Toronto Mississauga (UTM) campus resume.
Route 110 was temporarily suspended earlier this year in response to schools delaying in-person learning, which reduced customer demand and transit operator staff shortages due to COVID-19 self-isolation requirements.
11:20 a.m. A panel of Israeli health experts has recommended offering a fourth dose of coronavirus vaccine to all adults age 18 and over.
The shot would be administered only to those who received the vaccine at least five months earlier or recovered from coronavirus at least five months before, the Health Ministry said in a text message. The ministry’s director-general, Nachman Ash, would have to approve the recommendation for it to go into effect.
The recommendation was made after a ministry study showed that the fourth dose provided three to five times more protection against serious illness, and twice as much protection against infection than just a third dose. Israel began administering a fourth inoculation to the immunocompromised and people 60 and over earlier this month.
11 a.m. Some New York school districts are abandoning mask mandates, hours after a Long Island judge ruled them unconstitutional on Monday.
Nassau Supreme Court Judge Thomas Rademaker ruled that the state’s health commissioner lacked legal authority to issue her Dec. 10 mask-wearing regulation, citing the state Legislature’s decision to curtail the emergency powers bestowed on the executive branch during the pandemic.
New York Governor Kathy Hochul filed a notice to appeal the ruling, but some districts warned they were making mask-wearing optional anyway.
10:50 a.m. Beijing residents are coping with abrupt local lockdowns and sweeping COVID-19 testing requirements as the Chinese capital seeks to prevent a coronavirus outbreak ahead of the Winter Olympics that opens in less than two weeks.
The lockdowns are part of China’s “zero tolerance” measures to fight the pandemic that have been ratcheted-up ahead of the Games. Those now include requiring tests for anyone who purchases medications to treat cold, cough, fever and other maladies.
University student Cheryl Zhang said that the health code app that all Chinese have installed on their smart phones began notifying her to get tested after she bought medication four days previously.
10:20 a.m. (updated) Ontario is reporting 4,008 people hospitalized with COVID-19 and 626 in the ICU.
There are at least 3,424 new cases of COVID-19; 85 per cent of patients admitted to the ICU were admitted for COVID-19 and 15 per cent were admitted for other reasons but have tested positive for COVID-19, according to tweets from Health Minister Christine Elliott.
Ontario reported 64 new COVID-19 deaths on Tuesday which occured over the past 20 days.
10:10 a.m. Team Toronto has now administered third doses of COVID-19 vaccine to 55.5 per cent of eligible Toronto residents, according to a press release from the city.
Team Toronto ramped up vaccination capacity to help residents get their third vaccine dose in December. Residents age 18 and older are eligible for a third booster dose 84 days after their second dose of COVID-19 vaccine. In total, 1,289,164 people have now received their third dose from Team Toronto across the city.
8:46 a.m. Russian figure skater Mikhail Kolyada has been ruled out of next month’s Beijing Olympics after testing positive for the coronavirus.
The Russian Figure Skating Federation said Tuesday that Kolyada tested positive ahead of traveling to a pre-Olympic training camp and has been replaced by Evgeni Semenenko.
“Several days ago Mikhail Kolyada started feeling unwell,” the federation said. “For all this time the skater has not been training.”
8:32 a.m.: With the first full week of in-person learning since the Christmas break now underway, COVID-19 vaccination rates of kids aged five to 11 remain stubbornly low in areas home to Toronto’s most vulnerable and racialized communities.
Neighbourhoods in the city’s northwest corner, such as Rexdale, Black Creek and Mount Olive, as well as others to the east such as Thorncliffe Park — many of the spots hit hardest by the pandemic — make up the majority of the 20 areas with the lowest vaccination rates in the city for this age group, according to new data from Toronto Public Health.
In these areas, even with dozens of equity-driven campaigns by public health officials and community organizations in the nine weeks since five-to-11-year-olds became eligible for the shots , less than four in 10 kids in this age group have received a single vaccine.

7:45 a.m. Omicron is everywhere, and school is back. Government tracking systems can’t keep up. Some families couldn’t stand to send their children into classrooms if they couldn’t see the virus lurking there anymore. So they banded together, formed back-channel groups, networked, whittled data into spreadsheets — turned themselves into contact-tracing guerrilla units picking up public health slack.
Across Ontario, uncountable Whatsapp and Facebook groups sprouted in recent days, collections of parents contact-tracing on their own, as Ontario had given up on reporting COVID-19 outbreaks in schools to families this month — opting instead to have local public health units only notify families when school absences hit 30 per cent, and not necessarily from COVID.
Efforts from these parent groups range from simple messages informing each other of their kids’ symptoms, to spreadsheets with rapid-test results, to full-on data visualizations.

7:30 a.m. With each long-term-care lockdown, John Jarema watched his mother decline.
Before COVID’s first wave kept Daniela alone in her room, she used a walker to join fellow residents in the common area of her west Toronto nursing home, the not-for-profit Copernicus Lodge. Now, in the Omicron wave, 94-year-old Daniela is in a wheelchair, probably for good, her son said.
Once, she knew her way around the home. After the first lockdown, she no longer recognized her room. Now, she can’t leave it.
“I realize that dementia can account for some of this,” Jarema said, “but the mental and physical deterioration is quite evident since these lockdowns came into effect.”

7:15 a.m. Canadians’ self-reported anxiety and depression are nearing levels not seen since May 2020, signalling the Omicron wave has taken a significant toll on the mental health and wellbeing of many as we enter the third year of the pandemic.
The data comes from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health’s ninth national survey with technology company Delvinia on COVID-19 and the mental health of Canadians, conducted Jan. 7-11 — the final planned survey of its kind.
The survey, which asked around 1,000 Canadians nationwide about mental health metrics like anxiety, depression and substance use, found a quarter of respondents felt moderate to severe anxiety levels, and 22 per cent reported feeling depressed occasionally or most of the time in the previous week. It also found more than a quarter of participants are engaging in binge drinking.

5:43 a.m.: As the Omicron variant continues to strain Canadian hospitals, a vaccine hesitancy expert is voicing concern about the slow vaccination rate of children between the ages of five and 11.
In the two months since the approval of child-sized doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, only 51 per cent of children in that age group have had at least one dose.
That’s compared to more than 72 per cent of 12 to 17-year-olds in the two months following approval for that age range.
Kate Allen, a post-doctoral research fellow at Centre for Vaccine Preventable Diseases at the University of Toronto, says while she had predicted parents would be slower to have their younger children vaccinated, the rate is even lower that she expected.
Preliminary data on national life expectancy from Statistics Canada shows the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to an average seven-month decline — the largest decrease recorded since 1921 when the vital statistics registration system was introduced.
COVID-19 was the third leading cause of death in Canada in 2020, though Statistics Canada adds that the pandemic may have also contributed indirectly to a number of other deaths across the country.
Tuesday 5:39 a.m.: Groups representing Canada’s paramedics are calling for improved mental health services as staff shortages and unprecedented call volumes take a toll on workers.
Dave Deines, president of the Paramedic Association of Canada, said ambulance-paramedic services across the country are reporting increases in call volumes and decreases in staff because of the pandemic and the overdose crisis.
CUPE in Ontario said it conducted a survey of more than 14-hundred of its unionized paramedics in October that found 92 per cent said they were understaffed and the workload is hurting their mental and physical health.
The Manitoba Association of Health Care Professionals said an internal report obtained by the union shows ambulances were idled for a cumulative 17-thousand hours in October due to limited staff.
Manitoba Shared Health said in a statement that it has made recruitment a significant area of it’s focus.
The latest available data from B-C Emergency Health Services showed mental health was represented in about 46 per cent of all its long-term disability claims in 2020.
Troy Clifford, union president with the Ambulance Paramedics of B-C, said the government can’t recruit and retain enough workers and he’s calling for better wages and benefits to entice people to join and stay in the field.

Full text: It's shameful
that Dr. Moore rebuked Dr. Hirji
Admonished by Kieran Moore, Niagara medical officer stands by his increased safety measures in schools, Jan. 20
Dr. Kieran Moore should be ashamed of himself for making sure his admonishment of Niagara's acting officer of public health, Dr. Mustafa Hirji, went public.
It was a dirty, underhanded political trick to try to undermine Hirji's decisions to strengthen the measures in place to keep our schools safe and healthy. "Sharing" his letter with Niagara's regional council and school boards was childish and unworthy of Moore's position as our "leader" of public health.
Hirji has had to make several difficult decisions throughout the last two years that have resulted in threats and people bothering him at his private home, decisions that the Provincial Office of Public Health and the premier didn't have the guts to make. Moore and Premier Doug Ford have just made Hirji a target again.
That is reprehensible and shows that our provincial government does not really have public health at the forefront of their pandemic response decisions.
Terry Morocco, Welland
Chief medical officer of health of Ontario Dr. Keiran Moore says he wants "standardized" COVID-19 precautions in Ontario schools, but he wants them all to adopt a lower standard than that set by the Public Health Office of Niagara.
This is an astounding demand, and one that is unjustifiable. When Moore was medical officer of health in Kingston, he mandated masks before the province did.
It feels to me that he cared more about public health during his Kingston days, and now he cares more about politics.

Russia knows West's sanctions will fade in time
The best way to avoid war is to stand by Ukraine, Jan. 21
The Star concludes that the best way to ensure that the current crisis remains a political dispute is to work with allies on a co-ordinated strategy for severe sanctions against Russia.
Sanctions will be an irritant, but they will not stop Russia. The incursion into Crimea is proof that Russia is willing to pay the price of sanctions to get what it wants.
Russia knows that, with time, those sanctions will slowly disappear as the incursion into Ukraine is normalized.

We must address harassment of women in hockey
Women's shinny banner cools rink rage, Jan. 21
Brava to Emma Teitel for tackling the issue of women's equity in the recreation field and, in particular, ice time for women's hockey at our city rinks. Also for her willingness to endure what will undoubtedly be a deluge of abuse for her strong stand against the misogyny and homophobia displayed toward women recently on several rinks, including one in my own community.
We must not only enshrine women's rights to equality in all spheres, but also address the hatred underlying the acts of bullying and harassment by some of our young men.

Minority views can rule in our democracy
Why would U.S. Senate want democracy?, Jan. 22

Why isn't Toronto building more co-ops?: These houses offer an affordable place to live, but getting into one is a challenge

Full text: Let's buy a building, and turn it into a housing co-op.
Brian Iler was in his 20s, scarcely out of law school, when a pair of new friends pitched the idea. There was a group of them ready to go in together, all young and, in Iler's mind, still "a bunch of kids." But in the Toronto of the 1970s, their faith in their abilities ran high.
"The early '70s was a time of huge, not optimism perhaps but a feeling that hey, we can do anything if we put our mind to it," Iler said.
He agreed to provide legal support, and the gaggle of young Torontonians leveraged federal funding to buy a multi-unit apartment building in Toronto's west end - the origins of the Dufferin Grove Housing Co-operative.
While a variety of co-op models exist across the city - with some requiring residents buy into the building - the Dufferin site is among those that operate similarly to a rental, but without the traditional landlord structure. Residents become members of the co-op, giving them the autonomy to govern themselves and vote on decisions like whether to raise their housing bills.
Decades later, that structure has meant lower-than-usual housing costs for its occupants.
But building a co-op today - or even breaking into the ones that exist - has become a more uphill battle. Government funding to help with start-up costs doesn't exist like it used to, insiders say - and existing wait-lists have stretched so long they've had to be shut down.
That's why some housing advocates, elected officials and co-op tenants in Toronto are calling for an expansion of the sector, pitching it as a way to address soaring housing costs citywide.
Claire-Hélène Heese-Boutin is one of the occupants of the Dufferin Grove site.
She pays $1,294 a month for a two-bedroom - well below market rent for that sized unit - with neighbours who'll watch her cat Wesley and access to a community garden with "gorgeous plots" of kale and cherry tomatoes.
"There's just a sense of not being alone in the world," Heese-Boutin said. "You see the power of community, to meet each other's needs and to support each other."
Members each take on roles within the co-op structure. Hers is mowing their lawns, and she's also sat on their decision-making board. The idea of co-ops like Dufferin Grove, she said, is to create a form of housing that is insulated from the profit motives of the regular market.
Many co-ops also offer a certain number of subsidized units for lower income Torontonians, with deals inked with various levels of government to provide supplements to pay for them.
But to build new co-ops or expand existing ones, industry players say they're left cobbling together money from multiple programs at multiple levels of government, a process that can take years.
"I think the big difference is the other programs (in the 1970s and 1980s) were just more generous," said Tom Clement, executive director of the Co-operative Housing Federation of Toronto.
He pointed to a multi-year project underway in Riverdale, which is relying on numerous programs to renovate an existing co-op building and add 17 new units to the mix.
As co-op buildings age, many are also facing a need for repairs. At Windmill Line, a 1980s co-op near St. Lawrence Market, resident and board member Laura Schein said after their last mortgage ended in 2018, they took out a new one to do "extensive" renovations, such as replacing the roof and the roughly 200-unit building's windows.
Still, the cost of that new mortgage is within their budget, she said.
Schein has lived at the co-op since 2011, in a two-bedroom facing the lake. She owned her own house before, but it was becoming more expensive, and at age 65, tasks such as shovelling snow were taxing. The co-op is currently costing Schein less than $1,300 per month.
The building isn't perfect, Schein said. Few of their units are accessible to those with mobility challenges, posing an issue as residents age and use walkers or scooters.
But she loves the sense of democracy in the co-op, and seeing community efforts come together such as their recycling program. "Everybody has to work together," Schein said.
Shortly after moving in, she offered to join the welcome committee. When new residents arrived, that meant arranging a one-on-one meeting where she'd share a binder full of information about the co-op.
But there hasn't been anyone to welcome for years, Schein said.
"Units become available when people die," she told the Star, "and then they're often filled from an internal wait-list."
Ghani Osman is one of the rare new residents in the building, bypassing the external application system. Osman moved into Windmill Line as a long-term guest in 2018, while a co-op member he knew was away at school. That gave him access to an internal application process, and in 2019, he became a proper co-op member and moved into his current one-bedroom.
It costs him just $1,024 per month, he said, which allows him to live downtown, while helping financially support family members living overseas.
Osman has spent the past few years on the co-op's maintenance committee, helping residents with tasks such as hanging curtains. He savours having walkable access to grocery stores and transit, and to a nearby basketball court - all for an affordable price. And he worries that, without a wealth of similar housing options, many young Torontonians will simply leave the city.
"A lot of people that really bring culture to the city, (housing prices) are pushing them away," he said. "I hope our city opens up more buildings like this."
Heese-Boutin, like Schein, acknowledges that co-ops aren't perfect. It can take a while to get repairs or upgrades done, she said, with longer decision-making processes.
Recently, she said Dufferin co-op wound up selling a building. Iler confirmed the sale, saying the co-op saw the costs of fixing up the aging structure as prohibitive.
"I still get very emotional about that, because I don't think it was the right decision," Heese-Boutin said. But they'd voted to do it together, she added.
David Hulchanski, a housing expert with the University of Toronto, said he lived in a co-op himself in his younger years.
He believes creating more co-ops, depending on the depth of affordability they were able to offer occupants, could help chip away at Toronto's demand for rent-geared-to-income housing - with a citywide wait-list of 78,791 households as of September 2021.
"The devil is in the details," he said. But he sees the model, which doesn't require as much oversight, as positive.
"It's one of the best ways to go because people can manage the co-ops," he said.
Some politicians have also called for more attention on co-operative housing. When the Ontario government struck a housing affordability task force in December, with a mandate to look specifically at market-priced housing, Ontario Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner criticized the governing Progressive Conservatives for leaving options such as social and co-op housing out of focus.
Some government programs - at various levels - do offer assistance to the co-op sector. Ottawa points to programs such as its housing co-investment fund and rental construction financing initiative, as well as funds delivered through the province aimed at maintaining existing supply. Ontario, meanwhile, rolled out a renewal strategy for community housing such as co-ops in 2019.

Full text: Steven Del Duca is putting the old band back together in hopes of striking a chord with Ontario voters on June 2.
The Liberal leader has assembled a campaign team brimming with veterans from the Grits’ successful 2003, 2007, 2011, and 2014 elections won by former premiers Dalton McGuinty and Kathleen Wynne .
In a weekend memo to party president Brian Johns, which was shared with the Star, campaign director Christine McMillan says “we are now into the final sprint” for the spring vote.
“We need to refine campaign roles and realign into a different structure that carries us into the writ. This is not final and we will continue to adjust and be nimble,” wrote McMillan, adding there will be two new committees reporting to the campaign and that everything must be operational by April 4.
“The committees will be chaired by seasoned campaigners with the goal to mentor the next generation with a deputy chair from an equity seeking group,” she added.
“If you are leading a team, it needs to meet gender parity and be reflective of Ontario.”
Johns will chair the campaign and be responsible for fundraising with rising stars Kate Graham and Sumi Shan , who were candidates in 2018, serving as co-chairs.
Shan will work closely with veterans Christine Allenby and Jackie Choquette on candidate recruitment.
The Liberals, who hold only seven seats in the 124-member legislature, have nominated 70 candidates so far.
McMillan’s memo adds that David Gene and Lindsay Maskell, veterans of McGuinty’s more than nine years in power, will play key roles as “on the ground” co-chairs to get out Liberal voters on June 2.
Similarly, Bob Lopinski, a Liberal stalwart instrumental in getting McGuinty elected in 2003 and Wynne in 2014, will be “chair of message.”
Lopinski will also oversee Del Duca’s preparations for his debates with Progressive Conservative Premier Doug Ford, NDP Leader Andrea Horwath, and Green Leader Mike Schreiner.
He will work closely with Beckie Codd-Downey and Dan Moulton on the party’s campaign messaging, and long-time Liberal strategist Omar Khan will direct the “war room” to handle rapid response.
The campaign manager is Jonathan Espie, another seasoned professional from the Liberals’ nearly 15 years in government.
Del Duca’s chief of staff, Najva Amin, and director of operations, Charrissa McQuaig, also have major roles, as does lawyer Milton Chan, who was his campaign manager in the 2020 Liberal leadership race.
Other boldface Liberals volunteering on the campaign include policy chief Gabe Sekaly, Star contributor Ruby Latif , organizer Christine Bome, project leads Meghan Lauber and Karen Rosen, digital specialist Asif Hossain, and tour director Tim Smitheman.
Excluded from the official organization chart is polling guru Don Guy, who is volunteering as an adviser to Del Duca, and will be highly influential in the months ahead.
Guy, McGuinty’s most important political strategist, was a main architect of the Liberal dynasty that Ford ended in the 2018 Tory landslide.

Full text: Non-citizens in New York City, like me, just won the right to vote for mayor, city councillors and other roles within municipal government as soon as 2023. An estimated 800,000 permanent residents , authorized to work — and “Dreamers” too — will have their say thanks to a new law approved by city council.
In Ontario, municipalities are not empowered to make similar reforms. Progressive political parties should pledge them this autonomy ahead of the provincial election, as the current government is unlikely to support this change.
The powers of municipal governments are decided by the provincial government.
Premier Doug Ford withdrew the ability for municipalities to introduce electoral reform through ranked ballots when he took office, while also unilaterally reducing the size of Toronto city council .
Ford clearly wants to maintain control of municipalities at Queen’s Park.
The federal government appears to agree this issue is for provincial governments to decide on. It previously referred questions related to non-citizen voting to the Quebec government , when Montreal considered allowing non-citizens to vote as recently as this past April.
An important exercise is underway as political parties put together their platforms. These documents are foundational to what they will carry out later if they form government.
Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, Ford’s leadership was uninspired as he focused on undoing the legacy of the Liberals after years governing. To differentiate themselves, the other parties must think big.
Steven Del Duca, the Ontario Liberal leader, appears to be following Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s strategy to ascend from third party to government by outflanking the New Democrats on the left, like when he proposed to “ analyze the potential for a four-day work week .” This idea could also help achieve that.
With NYC on board, allowing non-citizens the vote is now an idea worth taking seriously beyond the ivory tower, where it has long been debated. But municipalities cannot meaningfully have this discussion now.
Non-citizen residents pay taxes and rely on the services of municipalities. Given high immigration, large swaths of the population cannot vote.
The COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted the value of non-citizens to our communities, as many provided essential services. To be clear: one should not need to prove their value to vote.
Critics argue they are protecting decision-making, and that this change would cheapen citizenship.
Municipal elections cannot be so important to Ontarians, if less than 40 per cent of those already eligible even bothered to vote in 2018 .
We should ask ourselves why so few of us care about the future of our municipalities. Why we are afraid to hear from other residents who do?
Many disenfranchised groups have later won the right to vote. Now is the time for political parties to pledge to allow municipalities the right to decide if non-citizens vote in their elections. This change will show leadership ahead of the provincial election, and help them differentiate themselves from an uninspired government.

Fringe parties want to spoil it for Ford

Full text: Spoiler alert!
Fringe parties could play the part of spoiler in Ontario's coming campaign.
Fear not. I won't spoil the ending for you, for I cannot foretell the finish at the political fringes.
But the pandemic has changed our politics in unpredictable ways. Here's how Doug Ford could be squeezed and possibly lose power in the coming months:
Watch for the premier to be undone not merely by his Liberal and NDP rivals, but also undermined by the far-right populists he once counted on. Anti-Ford, anti-lockdown and anti-vax voters remain a minority in Ontario, but they could have potentially outsized consequences in the June 2 election, when every seat counts.
They could also influence, consciously or unconsciously, the premier's handling of the pandemic between now and then. While many might want Ford to be tougher about mandating masks or demanding vaccines, doing so could cost him some of the voters he needs most, masks be damned.
Forget the idea that fringe parties are a far-off phenomenon in far-flung ridings with far-fetched policies and far-right leaders in the political wilderness. In fact, they could also have a major impact in Toronto-area ridings - and anywhere in Ontario - without winning a single seat.
While the new crop of protest parties is unlikely to elect anyone, they can bleed support away from Ford's Tories. In key ridings where his candidates won with narrow margins in the 2018 vote, the fringe could inflict a mortal blow.
In a close provincewide race, the loss of a few PC seats could cost Ford the majority he needs to retain power. That's because the opposition New Democrats and Liberals have both pledged to topple him in any post-election non-confidence motion and find a way to cobble together their own minority government to replace him as premier, as first reported by the Toronto Star last year.
What passes for a matter of principle - the fringe's freedom to refuse vaccines and the right to restrict abortions - is as much a grudge match played by former supporters who now feel betrayed by Ford's putative populism. Consider the new fringe parties, their recycled leaders and their revivified anti-vax followers:
The Ontario First Party (OFP) might well come last, but it has a head start thanks to the notoriety of its maverick founder, Randy Hillier. The MPP for Lanark-Frontenac-Kingston is practised in political reincarnation, first leading the Ontario Landowners' Association in rural protests for property rights, then running for the leadership of the PCs, later expelled from the party and finally refusing to wear masks while opposing vaccination requirements.
Hillier's OFP has been blessed by his fellow traveller in the realm of reincarnation, Maxime Bernier, the federal Tory leadership candidate who bolted to found the fringe People's Party of Canada (Bernier is returning the favour after Hillier endorsed the PPC last year). Hillier has almost no chance of retaining his seat in Lanark, but by siphoning off votes he could unseat his former fellow Tories elsewhere.
The New Blue Party of Ontario has the same old antecedents of protest parties everywhere. Cambridge MPP Belinda Karahalios, who was expelled from the PCs over her opposition to COVID-19 restrictions, has teamed up with spouse and one-time PC presidential candidate Jim Karahalios. She too is destined for defeat, but the New Blue could steal votes anew from Ford's true blue Tory candidate in her Cambridge riding.
Splitting the vote has long been a defining feature of Ontario elections, where three major parties - PC, NDP and Liberal - can get in each other's way, allowing one of them to sneak up the middle. That tendency has always helped the Tories when rival Liberals and New Democrats (and sometimes Greens) competed for the "progressive vote," while the PCs had the rest of the field to themselves.
In the 2018 election, the Tories could count on so-called "social conservatives" (anti-abortion and resistant to LGBTQ rights) to stick with them because they had nowhere else to go. Ford courted them assiduously, aligning himself with Charles McVety, the head of Canada Christian College who campaigned for Ford to win the PC leadership.
More recently, McVety has questioned the fidelity of Ford's Progressive Conservatives to social conservatives (notably for failing to return past favours by upgrading his college to coveted university status). This time, unlike last time, his ilk and his flock - in their various anti-vax, anti-lockdown and anti-abortion incarnations - have other places to park their protest votes.
Hence the paradox of this pandemic: The fringe parties likely won't win any seats, but they might make Ford lose a few.
That's not a spoiler alert or a prediction, merely a recognition that splinter parties want to spoil it for Ford, trying everything in their power to oust him. For the New Democrats and Liberals, who have spent so many elections splitting the vote, the outcome may yet splice them together in a minority government if Ford's Tories unravel on June 2.

Full text: Non-citizens in New York City, like me, just won the right to vote for mayor, city councillors and other roles within municipal government as soon as 2023. An estimated 800,000 permanent residents, authorized to work - and "Dreamers," too - will have their say thanks to a new law approved by city council.
In Ontario, municipalities are not empowered to make similar reforms. Progressive political parties should pledge them this autonomy ahead of the provincial election, as the current government is unlikely to support this change.
The powers of municipal governments are decided by the provincial government.
Premier Doug Ford withdrew the ability for municipalities to introduce electoral reform through ranked ballots when he took office, while also unilaterally reducing the size of Toronto city council.
Ford clearly wants to maintain control of municipalities at Queen's Park.
The federal government appears to agree this issue is for provincial governments to decide on. It previously referred questions related to non-citizen voting to the Quebec government, when Montreal considered allowing non-citizens to vote as recently as this past April.
An important exercise is underway as political parties put together their platforms. These documents are foundational to what they will carry out later if they form government.
Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, Ford's leadership was uninspired as he focused on undoing the legacy of the Liberals after years governing. To differentiate themselves, the other parties must think big.
Steven Del Duca, the Ontario Liberal leader, appears to be following Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's strategy to ascend from third party to government by outflanking the NDP on the left, like when he proposed to "analyze the potential for a four-day work week." This idea could also help achieve that.
With NYC on board, allowing non-citizens the vote is now an idea worth taking seriously beyond the ivory tower, where it has long been debated. But municipalities cannot meaningfully have this discussion now.
Non-citizen residents pay taxes and rely on the services of municipalities. Given high immigration, large swaths of the population cannot vote.
The pandemic has also highlighted the value of non-citizens to our communities, as many provided essential services. To be clear: one should not need to prove their value to vote.
Critics argue they are protecting decision-making, and that this change would cheapen citizenship. Municipal elections cannot be so important to Ontarians, if less than 40 per cent of those already eligible even bothered to vote in 2018.
We should ask ourselves why so few of us care about the future of our municipalities. Why we are afraid to hear from other residents who do?
Many disenfranchised groups have later won the right to vote. Now is the time for political parties to pledge to allow municipalities the right to decide if non-citizens vote in their elections. This change will show leadership ahead of the provincial election, and help them differentiate themselves from an uninspired government.

Full text: Ontario Premier Doug Ford seems, at long last, to have learned something about the merits of under-promising and over-performing.
In announcing the province's plan to ease COVID-19 restrictions on Thursday, Ford was not singing Happy Days Are Here Again or predicting the date on which masks might be discarded and vaccine certificates consigned to scrapbooks.
The premier has been burned in the past with that sort of over-optimistic folly, the product perhaps of his days as a salesman.
Ford has apparently come to see that there's no such thing as certainty in the fight against COVID-19, and that little disappoints the public more than declaring Mission Accomplished when there are still battles to be fought.
He acknowledged as much in making the announcement. "We can be confident the worst is behind us," he said. But still, "we need to remain cautious."
The province's plan, to take effect Jan. 31, will allow indoor dining and gyms to reopen and will increase limits on gatherings to 10 people indoors and 25 outdoors.
Retailers, shopping malls and cinemas can reopen at 50-per-cent capacity. Entertainment venues such as museums, galleries, aquariums, zoos, casinos and bingo halls can also reopen.
Spectators will be allowed at sporting events, concerts and theatres to a capacity of 50 per cent or 500 people, whichever is less.
Three phases are planned, with further easing of restrictions to take place on Feb. 21, then March 16.
Both the staged reopening and Ford's assurances that he will take whatever action needed if it goes badly were sensible.
"If that means pausing between steps for a few extra days, we won't hesitate to do so," he said.
From the beginning, there has been disagreement about where to draw the line between public health concerns and the economic distress and collateral damage caused by measures to combat the pandemic.
But it's safe to say there is reasonable consensus among an exhausted citizenry that it's time to accept a little risk in beginning the return to whatever normal will now look like.
There is always the suspicion with Ford that his chief sympathies lie with the plight of business. But it's difficult to chide him for going too far when businesses were immediately complaining that he had not gone far enough, fast enough.
There is also the likelihood that, facing a provincial election in June, political imperatives are a factor in Ford wanting to get things reopened as soon as possible. There probably are.
But political leaders would wait a long time before a perfect moment for reopening came along. Choices must be made.
Still, Ford should have been clearer on a couple of points. Those whose elective surgeries have been cancelled because of the pandemic's demands on the health-care system need a better sense of when they may expect care.
It would have been heartening to hear the premier commit to a more robust testing regime.
And with evidence ever more compelling about the disproportionate caseload of the unvaccinated clogging hospitals and ICUs, Ford might have chosen to apply some Quebec-style stick - by requiring vaccine certificates to access non-essential retailers such as LCBO and cannabis outlets - to encourage the unvaxxed to get their shots.
Still, the plan is, on balance, reasonable. And, all to the good, it would appear the premier is less prone to braggadocio and has learned to display a little more humility.
Hard experience is a wonderful teacher.

Full text: Let’s buy a building, and turn it into a housing co-op.
Brian Iler was in his 20s, scarcely out of law school, when a pair of new friends pitched the idea. There was a group of them ready to go in together, all young and, in Iler’s mind, still “a bunch of kids.” But in the Toronto of the 1970s, their faith in their abilities ran high.
“The early ’70s was a time of huge, not optimism perhaps but a feeling that hey, we can do anything if we put our mind to it,” Iler said.
He agreed to provide legal support, and the gaggle of young Torontonians leveraged federal funding to buy a multi-unit apartment building in Toronto’s west end — the origins of the Dufferin Grove Housing Co-operative.
While a variety of co-op models exist across the city — with some requiring residents buy into the building — the Dufferin site is among those that operate similarly to a rental, but without the traditional landlord structure. Residents become members of the co-op, giving them the autonomy to govern themselves and vote on decisions like whether to raise their housing bills.
Decades later, that structure has meant lower-than-usual housing costs for its occupants.
But building a co-op today — or even breaking into the ones that exist — has become a more uphill battle. Government funding to help with start-up costs doesn’t exist like it used to, insiders say — and existing wait-lists have stretched so long they’ve had to be shut down.
That’s why some housing advocates, elected officials and co-op tenants in Toronto are calling for an expansion of the sector, pitching it as a way to address soaring housing costs citywide.
Claire-Hélène Heese-Boutin is one of the occupants of the Dufferin Grove site.
She pays $1,294 a month for a two-bedroom — well below market rent for that sized unit — with neighbours who’ll watch her cat Wesley and access to a community garden with “gorgeous plots” of kale and cherry tomatoes.
“There’s just a sense of not being alone in the world,” Heese-Boutin said. “You see the power of community, to meet each other’s needs and to support each other.”
Members each take on roles within the co-op structure. Hers is mowing their lawns, and she’s also sat on their decision-making board. The idea of co-ops like Dufferin Grove, she said, is to create a form of housing that is insulated from the profit motives of the regular market.
Many co-ops also offer a certain number of subsidized units for lower income Torontonians, with deals inked with various levels of government to provide supplements to pay for them.
But to build new co-ops or expand existing ones, industry players say they’re left cobbling together money from multiple programs at multiple levels of government, a process that can take years.
“I think the big difference is the other programs (in the 1970s and 1980s) were just more generous,” said Tom Clement, executive director of the Co-operative Housing Federation of Toronto.
He pointed to a multi-year project underway in Riverdale, which is relying on numerous programs to renovate an existing co-op building and add 17 new units to the mix.
As co-op buildings age, many are also facing a need for repairs. At Windmill Line, a 1980s co-op near St. Lawrence Market, resident and board member Laura Schein said after their last mortgage ended in 2018, they took out a new one to do “extensive” renovations, such as replacing the roof and the roughly 200-unit building’s windows.
Still, the cost of that new mortgage is within their budget, she said.
Schein has lived at the co-op since 2011, in a two-bedroom facing the lake. She owned her own house before, but it was becoming more expensive, and at age 65, tasks such as shovelling snow were taxing. The co-op is currently costing Schein less than $1,300 per month.
The building isn’t perfect, Schein said. Few of their units are accessible to those with mobility challenges, posing an issue as residents age and use walkers or scooters.
But she loves the sense of democracy in the co-op, and seeing community efforts come together such as their recycling program. “Everybody has to work together,” Schein said.
Shortly after moving in, she offered to join the welcome committee. When new residents arrived, that meant arranging a one-on-one meeting where she’d share a binder full of information about the co-op.
But there hasn’t been anyone to welcome for years, Schein said.
“Units become available when people die,” she told the Star, “and then they’re often filled from an internal wait-list.”
Ghani Osman is one of the rare new residents in the building, bypassing the external application system. Osman moved into Windmill Line as a long-term guest in 2018, while a co-op member he knew was away at school. That gave him access to an internal application process, and in 2019, he became a proper co-op member and moved into his current one-bedroom.
It costs him just $1,024 per month, he said, which allows him to live downtown, while helping financially support family members living overseas.
Osman has spent the past few years on the co-op’s maintenance committee, helping residents with tasks such as hanging curtains. He savours having walkable access to grocery stores and transit, and to a nearby basketball court — all for an affordable price. And he worries that, without a wealth of similar housing options, many young Torontonians will simply leave the city.
“A lot of people that really bring culture to the city, (housing prices) are pushing them away,” he said. “I hope our city opens up more buildings like this.”
Heese-Boutin, like Schein, acknowledges that co-ops aren’t perfect. It can take a while to get repairs or upgrades done, she said, with longer decision-making processes.
Recently, she said Dufferin co-op wound up selling a building. Iler confirmed the sale, saying the co-op saw the costs of fixing up the aging structure as prohibitive.
“I still get very emotional about that, because I don’t think it was the right decision,” Heese-Boutin said. But they’d voted to do it together, she added.
David Hulchanski, a housing expert with the University of Toronto, said he lived in a co-op himself in his younger years.
He believes creating more co-ops, depending on the depth of affordability they were able to offer occupants, could help chip away at Toronto’s demand for rent-geared-to-income housing — with a citywide wait-list of 78,791 households as of September 2021.
“The devil is in the details,” he said. But he sees the model, which doesn’t require as much oversight, as positive.
“It’s one of the best ways to go because people can manage the co-ops,” he said.
Some politicians have also called for more attention on co-operative housing. When the Ontario government struck a housing affordability task force in December, with a mandate to look specifically at market-priced housing, Ontario Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner criticized the governing Progressive Conservatives for leaving options such as social and co-op housing out of focus.
Some government programs — at various levels — do offer assistance to the co-op sector. Ottawa points to programs such as its housing co-investment fund and rental construction financing initiative, as well as funds delivered through the province aimed at maintaining existing supply. Ontario, meanwhile, rolled out a renewal strategy for community housing such as co-ops in 2019.
Heese-Boutin wants to see the co-op sector grow, arguing it offers increased stability as well as more affordability.
“Our housing is our home,” Heese-Boutin said. “It’s not our asset.”

Full text: The Manitoba Liberals are asking the auditor general and civil service commissioner to look into allegations the Progressive Conservatives broke the rules and had government employees labouring on the 2019 provincial election campaign during work time.
It s taken 18 months to get the government to release emails indicating staff were working on the snap election campaign that was called a year ahead of schedule by then-premier Brian Pallister, Liberal Leader Dougald Lamont said Wednesday.
The information request was made after June 2020, when the Free Press reported Pallister s director of stakeholder relations, Michael Kowalson, was ordered by the premier to refund taxpayers the money Kowalson made while working on the side for the federal campaign of Conservative MP Marty Morantz.
The Liberals were seeking to find out if Kowalson and other government staff were also working for the PCs on the provincial election campaign.
Lamont told reporters the Liberals received copies of emails from Kowalson to provincial government employees, including Jordan Sisson, who is now Premier Heather Stefanson s chief of staff. The emails were sent to government employees during work hours and discussed the campaign and logistics.
Had people been following the rules, there would ve been none, said Lamont. If the PCs decided to put their party organizers on the public payroll, Manitobans deserve to know about it.
Deputy premier Cliff Cullen said in a prepared statement Kowalson no longer works for the government, has apologized, paid back the money earned during the time he also spent working on a federal campaign, and Sisson is making sure it won t happen again.
As a result, the chief of staff has issued directives to staff outlining the rules of conduct for executive council employees to ensure all protocols are followed.

Full text: Doug Ford’s dogged shovelling in the face of a historic snowstorm has already become part of the Ford canon, alongside other iconic moments like baking that cherry cheesecake and that time he said that anti-maskers were “a few fries short of a happy meal.”
In many ways, “Doug Ford vs. the weather” was red meat for the base: a headline-grabbing stunt that reminded voters why they have liked him and his brother Rob for decades.
Ford is folksy. Ontarians know this. His affable charm is not up for debate. He is approachable and relatable. Everyone has an uncle that he reminds them of, and it is easy to imagine shooting the breeze with him in a Tim Hortons’ parking lot. The Premier’s affinity for retail politics is unarguably one of his biggest strengths.
Is it a coincidence that the perceived need to shore up his base happened on the day of a snowstorm? Maybe. However, it more likely corresponds with the release of unfavourable polling numbers and what was surely an unpleasant Monday morning coffee for the Premier as he read his daily briefing binder.
Was this a good strategy, in the wake of those bad numbers? It may turn out to have been quite clever, in two ways.
There are memes and jokes being shared throughout social media and WhatsApp groups, mocking the size of the Premier’s shovel and ridiculing the value he added by pulling neighbours out of ditches and shovelling walkways.
The people making and laughing at those jokes were not Ford’s target audience. Those people were not voting for Ford before he got to work with a small plastic shovel and now, afterwards, they still aren’t voting for him. (If you doubt that there was strategy at play here, note that the Premier’s lead communicator was connecting with media outlets throughout the day.)
This was a stunt that appealed to his voting base: a can’t miss reminder that he’s still the charming everyman they elected nearly four years ago. This resonates because of the importance of authenticity in politics: a fair observer can conclude that Ford genuinely does care about people and genuinely does want to help them. He really did want to spend the day rolling around in his giant vehicle, talking to real people and making their days better in small ways. For his core supporters, discussion about how a premier should spend his time are far less important than this demonstration of Ford Family Values.
It also changed the channel. The media cycle on Monday would have been dominated by the return of Ontario students to school and punctuated by valid criticism regarding the steps government has taken to keep students safe in school.
Instead, Twitter was aflame with impassioned arguments: thoughtful admonishments about the role of the executive in a parliamentary system and thoughtless insults. All major media outlets covered his efforts and some broadcast media even carried him live. His polarizing efforts to be a good neighbour have dominated the public conversation and that meant that we were not talking about pandemic-related public policy failures.
The Premier could not have hoped to lead during a global crisis that will be forever marked in human history, but it has provided him with avenues to demonstrate his strengths. His weaknesses are well documented, but this hands-on storm response is an example of successfully executed pre-election strategy.

Martin Regg Cohn: For Ontario voters, the race for second place might be the most interesting

Full text: Post-Omicron, pre-election, one question will preoccupy the province:
Can anyone defeat Doug Ford?
Who will have the most persuasive policies? Does it even matter, given that Ford’s Tories won the last election without a detailed platform?
What’s the path to victory? And how’s it working so far?
In the 19 weeks leading up to the June 2 vote, you will read countless predictions and assumptions, based on individual intuitions and extrapolations, because everyone has an opinion about the premier and his prospects. The campaign trail is not linear, so the only certainty is uncertainty.
No one knows who will be premier in the aftermath. But if people are deeply divided, the key question is where the anti-Ford vote goes — who will be the most plausible and electable dragon slayer?
Voters looking for a change may be more interested in winnability than personality or policy. In the 2015 federal election, rival opposition parties duelled hard to see who would be seen by voters as the best vehicle to defeat then-PM Stephen Harper.
What stands out in the polls to date is how remarkably resilient Ford’s Progressive Conservatives remain after nearly four turbulent years in power. The governing party is typically in the doldrums before every election, yet the Tories have maintained a significant lead in the polls almost without letup, even in the run-up to the campaign.
But the one unanswered question is whether they have a big enough lead to retain a majority government on voting day, or whether they slide into minority territory. In which case all bets are off.
The non-partisan “survey of surveys” by 338Canada projects the PCs winning 36 per cent of the popular vote and 64 of the legislature’s 124 seats, eking out a slim majority. It also shows the major opposition parties in a dead heat, with the NDP and Liberals at 27 per cent each in the popular vote, and virtually tied in seats (30 and 29 respectively), with the Greens holding on to their one riding.
The respected online website calculates the odds of the Tories coming out on top at 99 per cent. But the likelihood of winning a majority is projected at 59 per cent — not exactly a sure thing.
Opposition parties usually like to keep their options open. But NDP Leader Andrea Horwath and the Liberals’ Steven Del Duca both told me last summer, in their first public comments and commitments on this issue, that they would defeat a Ford minority government and work together to replace it.
What that would look like is impossible to see in advance, but it adds suspense to the outcome — not least because whichever party finishes second could end up on top by default in a minority scenario. That uncertainty could energize wavering PC supporters to shore up a Ford majority, but it could also motivate anti-Ford voters to make their ballots count.
All the more reason to know who is best placed to defeat the Tories, who captured 76 of the legislature’s 124 seats in the last election. Finishing second, the NDP formed the official opposition with 40 seats, and the Liberals fell to a distant third (losing official party status) with seven, while the Greens’ Mike Schreiner won the party’s first-ever seat.
Starting from so far back, the Liberals have a lot of seats to win back, while the NDP has a significant head start. But the polls tell a different story — with little certainty, only volatility as the two parties fight for second place — and keep trading places.
A new poll released this week by EKOS shows the Tories at 35 per cent, the NDP at 27 and the Liberals at 26 per cent, broadly reflective of the recent trend line. An Innovative Research poll last week raised eyebrows by showing the Liberals jumping into the lead with 36 per cent, followed closely by the Tories at 35 per cent and the NDP far behind at 22 per cent (it did not, however, include the leaders’ names, just the party brands).
The question of who’s on top — the Tories — has been overshadowed by who’s on second. We don’t have a clear answer.
As for the broader question of what the opposition parties stand for, and how they differ from the governing party and each other? Stay tuned for more columns on content, but don’t be surprised if the horse race overshadows the platforms in much of the media coverage.
Remember the big issues in the 2018 campaign? Buck-a-beer faded faster than a head of foam, a promised 12-per-cent cut to “high hydro prices” is long forgotten, firing the “six-million-dollar man” at Hydro One cost the province millions more, killing the carbon tax only gave us a federal carbon levy, and the gas plants “boondoggle” is a closed book.
All those slogans turned out to be diversions, wedges and footnotes. In truth, the last campaign turned on the strength of Ford’s supposed populism and the plummeting popularity of Kathleen Wynne’s Liberal incumbents.
What will be the issues that count in the 2022 campaign? Will politicians offer persuasive answers on managing COVID, economic recovery and poverty, hospital capacity, ailing nursing homes, environmental stewardship, the housing crunch, highway controversies and transit challenges?
Ontario voters usually wait until the last minute to focus on an election, and people are more preoccupied by the pandemic than politics of late. Whatever your priority — winnability or policy, or both — it’s time to start talking and thinking about the possibilities.
I’ll be hosting Ontario’s three opposition leaders — the NDP’s Horwath, the Liberals’ Del Duca and the Greens’ Schreiner — at a pre-election Ryerson Democracy Forum on Tuesday, Jan. 25 via Zoom (open to the public and registration is free but required in advance). Let’s see how they answer your questions.

Full text: The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Thursday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available.
3:42 p.m. Barberian’s Steak House is teaming up with University Health Network today for a vaccination clinic aimed at frontline food and hospitality workers.
The clinic is offering first, second and third doses to people in the industry. No appointment or identification is required. Shots are being given until 6 p.m. at Barberian’s (7 Elm St., Toronto).
“By opening our doors and hosting this ‘low-barrier’ vaccine clinic, we show that restaurants are part of the solution,” Arron Barberian, the steak house’s owner, said in a statement. “The only way for society to end the unprecedented hardship of COVID-19 on restaurant & hospitality workers, suppliers and restaurant owners is to lower the hospital ICU load.
“This clinic is a small but essential step in that direction. The sooner we are all vaccinated, the sooner our doors will open.”
1:52 p.m. Canada Post says it is seeking "clarification" from the federal government about face masks after drawing criticism for refusing to let employees bring their own N95 masks to work.
The Crown corporation earlier this week said employees had to use a Canada Post-issued cloth mask or disposable medical mask, or they would be sent home.
Today a spokesman tells The Canadian Press they are looking to understand from federal authorities if mask guidance has changed.
Jon Hamilton says the health and safety of employees is the top priority, and the Crown corporation "strictly adhered" to guidance from health experts.
1:40 p.m. Nunavut's health minister says he's concerned too many residents are either not vaccinated or not fully vaccinated against COVID-19.
John Main says he wants people to encourage their friends and family members to get a shot.
Chief public health officer, Dr. Michael Patterson, says a person who died from COVID-19 earlier this week was over 70 years old and was not fully vaccinated.
Government figures show 71 per cent of those five and older have had two doses of vaccine.
There are 175 reported cases of infection spread over 19 communities.
1:27 p.m. Health officials in Prince Edward Island are reporting 249 new cases of COVID-19 Thursday along with 292 more recoveries.
There are 2,471 active reported cases in the province, down 43 from Wednesday.
Officials say 10 people are hospitalized with the disease, including two people in intensive care.
Another three patients are in hospital for non-COVID-19 reasons but who have tested positive following routine screening.
Meanwhile, the provincial government is extending some programs to help businesses impacted by the pandemic and offering a new wage-rebate program.
1 p.m. Leaked government modelling indicates that Saskatchewan's hospitalizations from COVID-19 will reach record levels by mid-February if people don't reduce their gathering sizes.
It says a best-case scenario would see more than 500 patients admitted — nearly double what the province experienced last fall during the Delta wave.
Six of Saskatchewan's largest unions representing 113,000 front-line workers are demanding more safety measures to blunt the rise of hospitalizations.
During a joint news conference today, they asked Premier Scott Moe to immediately mandate recommendations made by chief medical health officer Dr. Saqib Shahab.
They include a 10-person cap on gatherings and a limit on interprovincial travel.
12:45 p.m. The number of people in Quebec hospitals with COVID-19 has declined for the first time since Dec. 16.
The Health Department says 3,411 people were in hospital with the disease, 14 fewer than the day before, after 352 people were admitted and 366 were discharged.
It says 285 people were in intensive care, unchanged from the day before.
Officials are today reporting 98 additional deaths linked to the disease, the highest number of deaths reported in a single day since May 2020. The Health Department did not say how many of those deaths took place within the previous 24 hours.
Authorities say 6,528 new COVID-19 cases were detected in the previous 24 hours and 12 per cent of tests came back positive, however they warn the numbers provide a partial picture because testing is restricted to certain higher-risk groups.
12:05 p.m. Recent data suggests COVID-19 infections may have peaked or be close to peaking in Toronto, even though the health-care system remains strained, according to Dr. Eileen de Villa, medical officer of health, speaking at a press conference on Thursday morning.
The seven-day moving average of COVID-19 cases in Toronto dropped from 1,854 on Jan. 11 to 1,414 on Jan. 19. Per cent positivity also decreased during the same period, from 23.8 per cent to 20.3 per cent.
In addition, wastewater surveillance , which involves testing sewage samples for the presence of the COVID-19 virus, measured a potential plateau or slight decline in virus activity in Toronto, between Dec. 9 to Jan. 8.

11:37 a.m. (updated) The end of the month will bring the lifting of Omicron restrictions, starting in three-week stages intended to keep the most contagious strain of COVID-19 yet from taking off again.
Closures of indoor restaurant dining, gyms, and cinemas are slated to end Jan. 31 with a move to 50 per cent customer capacity, Premier Doug Ford said Thursday as the provinces continues to cope with record-high hospitalization levels.
But there have been signs that COVID-19 infection rates are easing as the fast-moving Omicron variant appears to be peaking after racing through the province since it emerged in late November.

10:45 a.m. Three Australian Federal Court judges on Thursday revealed their reasons for backing a government order to deport tennis star Novak Djokovic , explaining they did not consider the “merits or wisdom of the decision.”
The judges on Sunday unanimously endorsed Immigration Minister Alex Hawke’s decision to deport the 34-year-old Serb following an urgent court challenge on the eve of what was to be Djokovic’s first match in defense of his Australian Open title. Djokovic accepted the verdict and flew from Melbourne to the United Arab Emirates hours later.
Chief Justice James Allsop and Justices James Besanko and David O’Callaghan on Thursday released a 27-page explanation of why they rejected Djokovic’s challenge.
10:23 a.m. Ontario is reporting 4,061 people are hospitalized with COVID-19 with 594 in ICU; 55 per cent were admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 and 45 per cent were admitted for other reasons but have tested positive for COVID-19.
10:12 a.m. On Jan. 23, Team Toronto’s latest mass vaccination event Vax The Northwest will be taking place at York University’s Aviva Centre in Northwest Toronto. Appointments for the clinic will open at 8 a.m. today in the provincial vaccine booking system, available by calling 1-833-943-3900 or by booking online
The clinic is focused on vaccinating people of all eligible ages from Northwest Toronto neighbourhoods, with a focus on neighbourhoods with lower vaccination rates.
9 a.m. The 75 fatal cases Ontario is set to report this morning are the most in any day since Feb. 4, 2021 , ranking as the 8th deadliest day of the pandemic so far, reports the Star’s Ed Tubb.
7:32 a.m. Interest rate hikes are on the horizon as inflation in Canada continues to soar.
Experts say consumers can expect a slight cooling in the real estate market, continuing high prices for food and other products, and possibly higher wages as well.
The annual pace of inflation climbed to a three-decade high in December 2021, according to Statistics Canada, hitting 4.8 per cent compared to the previous year. The steep rise is driven in part by the higher costs of real estate, food and passenger vehicles. And, as 2022 unfolds, economists say it’s not over yet.

5:54 a.m.: A school in B.C. could be under investigation by public health.
Based on a review of attendance patterns, it has been determined that Rosemont School has met a potential activity signal — a new term coined to refer to a threshold based on school attendance — according to a letter sent out by the school.
Once the threshold has been met it means public health will investigate further to determine if absences are related to a health matter and additional actions are needed.
A large number of absences at the school — which is a kindergarten to Grade 5 school located in the Rosemont neighbourhood of Nelson — prompted suspicions that there might be COVID-19 activity in the school.
Currently, no additional actions are being recommended although attendance throughout the week has been low.
If a school is to be closed it will be announced as early as possible so people can arrange child care, with the principal communicating to staff and all families informing them of the closure as well as how long it will be closed, noted the SD8 website.
5:52 a.m.: Ontario Premier Doug Ford is expected to make a “positive” announcement today about COVID-19 restrictions.
He told Ottawa radio station CFRA that he would have news about changing the level of restrictions this week, and a senior government source says that announcement is coming today.
It follows Health Minister Christine Elliott’s media availability yesterday when she said the province is seeing “glimmers of hope” in the fight against the Omicron variant.
She says COVID-19 cases are expected to peak this month and hospitalizations and ICU admissions will follow.
Elliott says February will continue to pose challenges, but the province is confident in its ability to care for patients in hospital and intensive care.
The province closed restaurants to in-person dining in early January at the same time that it temporarily shuttered gyms and moved schools to remote learning.
Schools reopened earlier this week.
5:51 a.m.: With COVID-19 hospitalizations in Canada still threatening to overwhelm the health-care system, officials hope two antiviral treatments could help ease the strain.
A new study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal suggests the antiviral medication remdesivir could have a “modest but significant effect’’ on COVID-19 patient outcomes, including decreasing the need for mechanical ventilation by approximately 50 per cent.
Billed as the largest single-country trial of remdesivir reported to date, the Canadian research is part of a larger study called the World Health Organization Solidarity, a randomized, controlled trial evaluating the medication’s impact on COVID-19 patients in several countries.
Meanwhile, provinces and territories are to receive their shipments of the antiviral drug Paxlovid, although Prime Minister Justin Trudeau cautions the pill that can prevent COVID hospitalization is not a replacement for vaccinations.
5:49 a.m.: Austria’s Parliament is due to vote Thursday on introducing a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for adults, the first of its kind in Europe.
The mandate drawn up by the government would apply to all residents of Austria age 18 and over, with exemptions for pregnant women, individuals who for medical reasons can’t be vaccinated, and people who have recovered from a coronavirus infection in the past six months.
It appears assured of approval. Chancellor Karl Nehammer’s governing coalition, made up of his conservative Austrian People’s Party and the Greens, worked with two of the three opposition parties in Parliament on the plan. The other opposition party, the far-right Freedom Party, vehemently opposes it.
The plan is for the vaccine mandate to become law at the beginning of February. To start with, authorities will write to every household to inform them of the new rules.
5:47 a.m.: Now, almost two years later, Spain is preparing to adopt a different COVID-19 playbook. With one of Europe’s highest vaccination rates and its most pandemic-battered economies, the government is laying the groundwork to treat the next infection surge not as an emergency but an illness that is here to stay. Similar steps are under consideration in neighbouring Portugal and in Britain.
The idea is to move from crisis mode to control mode, approaching the virus in much the same way countries deal with flu or measles. That means accepting that infections will occur and providing extra care for at-risk people and patients with complications.
Spain’s center-left prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, wants the Europe Union to consider similar changes now that the surge of the omicron variant has shown that the disease is becoming less lethal.
“What we are saying is that in the next few months and years, we are going to have to think, without hesitancy and according to what science tells us, how to manage the pandemic with different parameters,” he said Monday.
Sánchez said the changes should not happen before the omicron surge is over, but officials need to start shaping the post-pandemic world now: “We are doing our homework, anticipating scenarios.”
5:45 a.m.: New Zealand is among the few remaining countries to have avoided any outbreaks of the omicron variant — but Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Thursday an outbreak was inevitable and the nation would tighten restrictions as soon as one was detected.
But she also said that New Zealand would not impose the lockdowns that it has used previously, including for the Delta variant.
“This stage of the pandemic is different to what we have dealt with before. Omicron is more transmissible,” Ardern said. “That is going to make it harder to keep it out, but it will also make it more challenging to control once it arrives. But just like before, when COVID changes, we change.”
Ardern said that within 24 to 48 hours of omicron being detected in the community, the nation would move into its “red” setting. That would allow businesses to remain open and domestic travel to continue, but would require schoolchildren to wear masks and limit crowds to 100 people.
Currently most of New Zealand is at the “orange” setting, which requires some mask wearing and proof of vaccination but doesn’t limit crowd sizes.
Thursday 5:43 a.m.: Because the omicron variant was first identified in late November, it is too early to say how long symptoms of infection can persist. It is also unclear whether, like previous versions of the virus, it can lead to the emergence of problems like brain fog or extreme fatigue after the infection has resolved.
While recent reports suggest that omicron may cause less severe initial illness than other variants, the basic symptoms of infection with omicron are similar to infection with other variants, suggesting that long-term effects could also be similar.
Milder initial illnesses do not necessarily mean that omicron is less likely to lead to long COVID, doctors, researchers and patient-led groups caution. Studies from earlier waves of the pandemic indicate that many people who had mild or asymptomatic initial reactions to coronavirus infection went on to develop long COVID that persisted for months.

Full text: Doug Ford's dogged shovelling in the face of a historic snowstorm has already become part of the Ford canon, alongside other iconic moments like baking that cherry cheesecake and that time he said that anti-maskers were "a few fries short of a Happy Meal."
In many ways, "Doug Ford vs. the weather" was red meat for the base: a headline-grabbing stunt that reminded voters why they have liked him and his brother Rob for decades.
Ford is folksy. Ontarians know this. His affable charm is not up for debate. He is approachable and relatable. Everyone has an uncle that he reminds them of, and it is easy to imagine shooting the breeze with him in a Tim Hortons' parking lot. The premier's affinity for retail politics is unarguably one of his biggest strengths.
Is it a coincidence that the perceived need to shore up his base happened on the day of a snowstorm? Maybe. However, it more likely corresponds with the release of unfavourable polling numbers and what was surely an unpleasant Monday morning coffee for the premier as he read his daily briefing binder.
Was this a good strategy, in the wake of those bad numbers? It may turn out to have been quite clever, in two ways.
There are memes and jokes being shared throughout social media and WhatsApp groups, mocking the size of the premier's shovel and ridiculing the value he added by pulling neighbours out of ditches and shovelling walkways.
The people making and laughing at those jokes were not Ford's target audience. Those people were not voting for Ford before he got to work with a small plastic shovel and now, afterwards, they still aren't voting for him. (If you doubt that there was strategy at play here, note that the premier's lead communicator was connecting with media outlets throughout the day.)
This was a stunt that appealed to his voting base: a can't miss reminder that he's still the charming everyman they elected nearly four years ago. This resonates because of the importance of authenticity in politics: a fair observer can conclude that Ford genuinely does care about people and genuinely does want to help them. He really did want to spend the day rolling around in his giant vehicle, talking to real people and making their days better in small ways. For his core supporters, discussion about how a premier should spend his time are far less important than this demonstration of Ford Family Values.
It also changed the channel. The media cycle on Monday would have been dominated by the return of students to school and punctuated by valid criticism regarding the steps government has taken to keep students safe in school.
Instead, Twitter was aflame with impassioned arguments: thoughtful admonishments about the role of the executive in a parliamentary system and thoughtless insults. All major media outlets covered his efforts and some broadcast media even carried him live. His polarizing efforts to be a good neighbour have dominated the public conversation and that meant that we were not talking about pandemic-related public policy failures.
The premier could not have hoped to lead during a global crisis that will be forever marked in human history, but it has provided him with avenues to demonstrate his strengths. His weaknesses are well documented, but this hands-on storm response is an example of successfully executed pre-election strategy.

Full text: Ontario Premier Doug Ford insists he doesn't trust polls, especially the ones that show his approval rating dropping fast.
"I don't believe in polls, especially five months before the election," Ford told an Ottawa radio talk show host this week. "And I don't believe in Liberal pollsters. They play this game all the time."
It may be a game to Ford, who in truth seems to love polls given the amount of private polling that his governing Conservative party is conducting these days.
But barely four months before the Ontario election on June 2, a series of polls in the past week that indicate more and more voters are becoming fed up with Ford with each successive wave of the COVID-19 pandemic is a growing concern within Ford's re-election team.
That's because while most polls put the Conservatives slightly ahead of both the NDP and Liberals, voter approval rating of Ford's handling of the COVID-19 crisis now hovers around 30 per cent, less than half of what it was in the early days of the pandemic.
Indeed, increasingly, Ford looks beatable in the coming election - an outcome considered impossible just a few months ago.
In fact, a poll released last week by Innovative Research Group found the Liberals favoured by 36 per cent of decided voters compared to 35 per cent for the Conservatives and just 22 per cent for the NDP.
"Ultimately, while the PCs have managed to remain competitive, the reaction to the latest wave of restrictions and lockdowns has left Ford's personal brand weakened and could lead to future problems for the party as a whole," the polling firm said.
Besides his falling performance ratings, Ford is facing more troubles as the election looms just 19 weeks away.
The sudden resignation last week of Rod Phillips, former finance minister and lately long-term care minister, is a major loss for Ford. Phillips was viewed as one of the "grown-ups" in Ford's cabinet, a veteran political operative who brought a sense of stability to Ford's team after a disastrous first year in office.
Martin Regg Cohn, the Star's Queen's Park columnist, wrote this week that Phillips "was the minister of competence who could see around corners in a government that goes by its gut.
Now, with the June 2 election looming, Ford is alone at the wheel."
Just days after Phillips' departure, Ford is already showing that he's back to his chaotic, old self.
Desperate to win back the love of voters frustrated with the current COVID restrictions, Ford promised - apparently without consulting with his team - that he's "going to make some announcements later this week about going back to other levels of restrictions."
And speaking of being "alone at the wheel," Ford was rightly criticized this week for doing a FaceTime video interview with a Toronto TV station while driving his pickup truck during Monday's snow storm.
Importantly, voters who were sick of the chaos and incompetence that Ford displayed in the early days of his term are likely sick anew of the chaos and incompetence that he's displaying now.
In addition, Ford may see the loss of many key ridings that the Tories won in 2018 due to the decisions of six of his sitting MPPs, in addition to Phillips, to not seek re-election. For example, the Ajax riding that Phillips represented was once a Liberal stronghold, but it could also well fall to the NDP, whose candidate is popular former Ajax mayor Steve Parrish.
Also worrying for Ford's team is the realization that the Liberals are primed to run serious campaigns in every riding they lost in 2018 and the NDP is ready to fight for as many of the 40 seats that it won in 2018 as it can.
Combined, these signs aren't great for Ford - whether he trusts the polls or not.

In Ontario, the race for second might be the most interesting

Full text: Post-Omicron, pre-election, one question will preoccupy the province:
Can anyone defeat Doug Ford?
Who will have the most persuasive policies? Does it even matter, given that Ford's Tories won the last election without a detailed platform?
What's the path to victory? And how's it working so far?
In the 19 weeks leading up to the June 2 vote, you will read countless predictions and assumptions, based on individual intuitions and extrapolations, because everyone has an opinion about the premier and his prospects. The campaign trail is not linear, so the only certainty is uncertainty.
No one knows who will be premier in the aftermath. But if people are deeply divided, the key question is where the anti-Ford vote goes - who will be the most plausible and electable dragon slayer?
Voters looking for a change may be more interested in winnability than personality or policy. In the 2015 federal election, rival opposition parties duelled hard to see who would be seen by voters as the best vehicle to defeat then-PM Stephen Harper.
What stands out in the polls to date is how remarkably resilient Ford's Progressive Conservatives remain after nearly four turbulent years in power. The governing party is typically in the doldrums before every election, yet the Tories have maintained a significant lead in the polls almost without letup, even in the run-up to the campaign.
But the one unanswered question is whether they have a big enough lead to retain a majority government on voting day, or whether they slide into minority territory. In which case all bets are off.
The non-partisan "survey of surveys" by 338Canada projects the PCs winning 36 per cent of the popular vote and 64 of the legislature's 124 seats, eking out a slim majority. It also shows the major opposition parties in a dead heat, with the NDP and Liberals at 27 per cent each in the popular vote, and virtually tied in seats (30 and 29 respectively), with the Greens holding on to their one riding.
The respected online website calculates the odds of the Tories coming out on top at 99 per cent. But the likelihood of winning a majority is projected at 59 per cent - not exactly a sure thing.
Opposition parties usually like to keep their options open. But NDP Leader Andrea Horwath and the Liberals' Steven Del Duca both told me last summer, in their first public comments and commitments on this issue, that they would defeat a Ford minority government and work together to replace it.
What that would look like is impossible to see in advance, but it adds suspense to the outcome - not least because whichever party finishes second could end up on top by default in a minority scenario. That uncertainty could energize wavering PC supporters to shore up a Ford majority, but it could also motivate anti-Ford voters to make their ballots count.
All the more reason to know who is best placed to defeat the Tories, who captured 76 of the legislature's 124 seats in the last election. Finishing second, the NDP formed the official opposition with 40 seats, and the Liberals fell to a distant third (losing official party status) with seven, while the Greens' Mike Schreiner won the party's first-ever seat.
Starting from so far back, the Liberals have a lot of seats to win back, while the NDP has a significant head start. But the polls tell a different story - with little certainty, only volatility as the two parties fight for second place - and keep trading places.
A new poll released this week by EKOS shows the Tories at 35 per cent, the NDP at 27 and the Liberals at 26 per cent, broadly reflective of the recent trend line. An Innovative Research poll last week raised eyebrows by showing the Liberals jumping into the lead with 36 per cent, followed closely by the Tories at 35 per cent and the NDP far behind at 22 per cent (it did not, however, include the leaders' names, just the party brands).
The question of who's on top - the Tories - has been overshadowed by who's on second. We don't have a clear answer.
As for the broader question of what the opposition parties stand for, and how they differ from the governing party and each other? Stay tuned for more columns on content, but don't be surprised if the horse race overshadows the platforms in much of the media coverage.
Remember the big issues in the 2018 campaign? Buck-a-beer faded faster than a head of foam, a promised 12-per-cent cut to "high hydro prices" is long forgotten, firing the "six-million-dollar man" at Hydro One cost the province millions more, killing the carbon tax only gave us a federal carbon levy, and the gas plants "boondoggle" is a closed book.
All those slogans turned out to be diversions, wedges and footnotes. In truth, the last campaign turned on the strength of Ford's supposed populism and the plummeting popularity of Kathleen Wynne's Liberal incumbents.
What will be the issues that count in the 2022 campaign? Will politicians offer persuasive answers on managing COVID, economic recovery and poverty, hospital capacity, ailing nursing homes, environmental stewardship, the housing crunch, highway controversies and transit challenges?
Ontario voters usually wait until the last minute to focus on an election, and people are more preoccupied by the pandemic than politics of late. Whatever your priority - winnability or policy, or both - it's time to start talking and thinking about the possibilities.
I'll be hosting Ontario's three opposition leaders - the NDP's Horwath, the Liberals' Del Duca and the Greens' Schreiner - at a pre-election Ryerson Democracy Forum on Tuesday, Jan. 25 via Zoom (open to the public and registration is free but required in advance). Let's see how they answer your questions.

Memo to Doug Ford: stop shoveling and do your real job

Full text: Across Greater Toronto on Monday, thousands of citizens did the neighbourly thing, shoveling a senior’s walk, helping push marooned cars from snowdrifts, giving someone a lift.
Doubtless there were jokes, laughs, thanks and cheery “no problems.” Help happily – and anonymously – given.
Only one citizen seems to have made a multi-media, self-promotional meal of it.
That, of course, was Premier Doug Ford.
And in the performative exercise, in the misplaced focus, in the sham of it all was to be found much that’s wrong about the Ford family in public life.
First was the premier’s disregard of the express instructions of police and emergency services.
They had asked people to stay off roads so emergency services could operate. They reminded drivers to avoid distractions at the wheel.
But there was the premier, like some wannabe superhero, trolling the streets of Etobicoke, conducting Facetime interviews with a TV reporter while driving.
Doug Ford has been largely missing in action over the recent difficult weeks of the pandemic and the challenge of reopening schools.
Hospitals and emergency services are stretched almost to the point of collapse.
His former long-term care minister jumped ship in the midst of the pandemic, just months before an election.
There are many large, serious issues that it’s the premier’s job to address.
Instead, Ford – eager for applause and adulation — was out on the streets with a shovel like some small-town ward heeler.
The Fords are good at that sort of thing, as the late mayor Rob Ford showed years before his brother became premier. Retail politics is their trademark. But it’s not the job of high office. And in Doug Ford’s case it was done more for his benefit than for anyone else’s.
The video posted of Ford shovelling was critiqued on social media like a last-ditch football play and the premier seemed to demonstrate precious little experience at the task, rather like Donald Trump holding a Bible.
He shoved snow backwards between his legs, into his boots, back onto the road, clearing a patch well behind the rear tires and of no discernible use in getting the stalled car in motion.
Then there was a Tik-Tok video posted by @eddykandic95 in which the premier is seen giving a young man a lift.
“I’m the taxi driver today and snow plow and everything else,” Ford chirped. The operative word in the sentence being “I.”
Neither man, in the enclosed space of a car’s front seats, was wearing a mask.
The Fords never played by the rules, frequently acted as if they were above the law.
The Peel Paramedic Union tweeted out a reminder to the premier that when authorities advise against being on the roads and against distracted driving, “We are talking to you @fordnation.”
If Ford wants to do their jobs, the union said, maybe it should be allowed “to run the government long enough to fix the mess he has made.”
The premier was unapologetic.
“Just making sure people are safe in their cars and anything I can do to help them,” Ford told a TV host from his car.
What the premier could have done to make people safe was stay off the roads, stay off his phone and TV, wear a mask.
Then he might have had time for doing his real job.

Full text: On the heels of one of Toronto's bloodiest years, the city's 10-year community safety and well-being plan will launch with just over $12 million in funding if city council approves.
The new "SafeTO" program is the latest, significant effort to funnel resources to neighbourhoods struggling with gun violence and other crises after similar plans previously approved by council have seen a lack of political will and funding.
This time around, the 2022 work plan proposes: The launching of non-police crisis teams to respond to mental-health calls in a pilot project; bolstering the work of a team that responds to community needs after gunfire; and creating a new office dedicated to preventing gun violence.
"We all want a safer Toronto," said Mayor John Tory said in a planned press conference Wednesday to endorse the strategy.
"This report makes it clear that this is a top priority and that we are prepared as a city to put the resources and the people behind it to make it happen."
The proposal going to Tory's executive committee on Jan. 26 comes after the province rewrote the Police Services Act to focus on community-driven approaches to safety in 2019. Under those changes, all municipalities were required to prepare community safety plans by 2021, which Toronto did.
But the new Community Safety and Policing Act does not require funding for those plans from the province nor has Premier Doug Ford's government committed any.
The city's plan to implement SafeTO comes after another pandemic year with more than 80 homicides - one of the highest tallies in recent decades - more than half of them involving guns.
Already this year, four of seven homicides have seen victims under the age of 25.
The city's funding must be approved separately as part of the city's overall budget process. It is currently included in the budget proposed by city staff.
While $12 million is a small slice of the city's overall $15-billion operating budget, it would be a significant step for council.
It took years for the city to say it was fully implementing the $15-million Toronto Youth Equity Strategy to combat youth violence, first approved in 2014.
And a previous 10-year anti-gun violence plan approved by city council in 2014, totalling $50 million, relied entirely on funding from the other levels of government. Today, it remains largely unfunded despite election promises from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals.
"We've been patiently pursuing that, minister after minister, election after election," Tory said during his press conference. "It's time, I think, for that money to come forward."
The three programs recommended for funding this year look at key areas in need of immediate response as well as a central hub to co-ordinate efforts and collect data to inform city policy and strategy.
The crisis-team pilot project acknowledges police are not always required or wanted to see peaceful outcomes following painful tragedies for Black and Indigenous residents and people of colour in Toronto.
It will see local, established organizations like the Black Health Alliance working together in four different areas of the city to provide critical and appropriate supports for people experiencing a mental health crisis. Each area will have mobile teams of community health nurses, crisis counsellors and others who work around the clock, and relevant followup services.
The SafeTO plan will add $8.6 million in funding for that program.
A separate community crisis response program, which has been operating since 2008, will also get a boost.
After gunfire incidents, this team moves in to work with local communities in a culturally sensitive way to access psychological services, community debriefs, peer support groups and other supports as needed.
With a 39 per cent increase in firearm-related incidents between 2017 and 2020, the city implementation plan says, the team does not have the kind of surge capacity it needs to properly respond. Funding of just over $2 million will be used to hire six full-time positions to allow a more nimble seven-day model.
Lastly, the city is looking to create a Toronto Office to Prevent Gun Violence, based on successful models in London, Oakland and elsewhere. Funding of $1.4 million would allow different city officials - from police to school boards - to co-ordinate the response to and prevention of these incidents and collect centralized data to better inform real-time decisions about how to deploy resources as well as understand why there is conflict in neighbourhoods, among other efforts.
The city plan to establish a gun violence prevention office was welcomed by Ottawa-based criminologist Irvin Waller, author of "Science and Secrets of Ending Violent Crime" who has, for years, been advocating for such an approach.
"I think that is extraordinarily good news, if we are ever going to see a significant reduction in the numbers of people killed by gun violence and the numbers of people injured and traumatized by gun violence," Waller said.
He noted, however, that the proposed staffing level - nine full-time employees - was a minimum of what's likely to be required.
"This is so overdue."

Full text: The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Wednesday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available.
5:00 p.m.: Public health officials in Newfoundland and Labrador say 18 people are in hospital because of COVID-19, the highest number since the pandemic began.
The previous high for COVID-19 hospitalizations was 16 people on Oct. 7 last year.
A government news release says four of the 18 patients hospitalized are in critical care.
The province logged another 511 new COVID-19 cases today, with 21 per cent of tests completed since Tuesday yielding a positive result.
Officials say there are now 3,205 active reported infections in the province, and 471 people have recovered from the disease since Tuesday.
Memorial University announced today that in-person classes will resume on Jan. 31 for courses with fewer than 100 students at the school's St. John's campus.
4:30 p.m.: In what is being called a “remarkable” turnaround in the rental sector, the pandemic reprieve for Toronto region tenants appears to be at an end as vacancies fell and rental incentives declined in the final quarter of 2021.
Vacancies in purpose-built rentals completed since 2005 hit 2.4 per cent in the fourth quarter, down from 6.4 per cent at the start of 2021 and down from the 5.7 per cent vacancy rate of the fourth quarter of 2020, according to a Wednesday report from development-tracking market research firm Urbanation.
Before the pandemic in the final quarter of 2019, the region’s vacancy rate had fallen below 1 per cent.
In last year’s final quarter, the downtown rental sector remained in balanced territory at 3.1 per cent, less than half of the 7.4 per cent of a year earlier and the 9 per cent peak vacancy rate of the first quarter of 2021.

4:14 p.m.: More signs are pointing to a reopening of Ontario’s economy from this month’s COVID-19 restrictions, health officials say, but the lack of detail on when that will happen is frustrating the business community.
“We will be providing more clarity later this week,” Health Minister Christine Elliott told a news conference on improving pandemic trends Wednesday, echoing Premier Doug Ford’s vague teaser of “positive news” during a Tuesday radio interview .
Ontario Chamber of Commerce president Rocco Rossi said businesses resent being strung along two years into a public health crisis that has left survivors struggling and forced thousands into bankruptcy.

3:30 p.m.: Quebec’s Nunavik region moved into lockdown on Wednesday, as more than half the northern territory’s 14 Inuit communities were dealing with community spread of COVID-19.
“It is just a matter of time until Omicron will spread in all communities,” read a message on the Facebook page of the Nunavik Regional Board of Health and Social Services, referring to the highly transmissible mutation of the novel coronavirus.
A 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew is in effect across the region, which spans the northern third of the province. Schools and daycares remain open, but all non-essential public places are closed and private indoor gatherings are banned.
Health officials reported 28 new cases on Tuesday in the region, which had 260 active infections.
Meanwhile, Quebec on Wednesday reported a rise of eight hospitalizations linked to the disease — the lowest daily increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations since Dec. 17. Officials said 88 more people died of COVID-19.
The Health Department said 3,425 people were in hospital, after 359 patients were admitted in the past 24 hours and 351 were discharged. It said there were 285 people in intensive care, a drop of four from the day before.
Officials reported 6,123 new COVID-19 cases based on about 34,700 tests, 13.5 per cent of which came back positive. They said 110,035 doses of vaccine were administered in the previous 24 hours.
2:30 p.m. Face masks will no longer be mandatory in public places and COVID-19 passports will be dropped for large events as infections level off in most parts of the country, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Wednesday.
Johnson told lawmakers that the restrictions were being eased because government scientists think it is likely that the surge of infections prompted by the highly contagious Omicron variant “has now peaked nationally.”
While hospitals in northern England still are getting pressed by high caseloads and infections were still rising in schools, Johnson said hospital admissions and patients in intensive care units elsewhere in England were stabilizing or falling.
The government is no longer advising people to work from home, and compulsory face masks will be scrapped in secondary school classrooms starting Thursday.

2:25 p.m. Nova Scotia is reporting 11 new hospital admissions and three more deaths as a result of COVID-19.
Health officials said today a man in his 60s as well as a man and a woman in their 80s died in the Halifax area.
There have been eight COVID-19 deaths reported in the last three days.
A total of 83 people are in hospital receiving care in designated COVID-19 units, including 12 who are in intensive care.
Officials are reporting an additional 527 new lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19.
The province has an estimated 5,511 active infections.
2:20 p.m. More help is on the way for British Columbia businesses forced to stay closed for at least another month as the province tries to contain the spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19.
A statement from the Ministry of Jobs, Economic Recovery and Innovation says businesses, including event venues, bars, nightclubs and lounges, that don’t serve full meals are now eligible for grants of up to $20,000, based on staffing levels.
The funds, which double the amount available to those businesses, can be claimed through the provincial COVID-19 Closure Relief Grant.
Businesses ordered by the provincial health officer to remain closed at least until Feb. 16 are eligible for the larger amount, while those that have since been allowed to reopen can claim up to $10,000.
1:53 p.m . A Canadian study suggest the antiviral medication remdesivir could have a “modest but significant effect” on COVID-19 patient outcomes, including decreasing the need for mechanical ventilation by approximately 50 per cent.
The study, published Wednesday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, is the largest single-country trial of remdesivir reported to date.
Results are part of a larger study called the World Health Organization Solidarity, a randomized, controlled trial evaluating remdesivir’s impact on COVID-19 patients in several countries.
Researchers at the University of British Columbia and Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto recruited 1,282 patients at 52 hospitals between Aug. 14, 2020 and April 1, 2021. Roughly half received a 10-day course of remdesivir and the other half the usual level of care.
Among patients not on ventilation at the start of the study, eight per cent or 46 patients in the remdesivir group went on to require a ventilator compared to 15 per cent, or 89 patients, who received standard care. The study also found patients on remdesivir came off oxygen and ventilators sooner.
12:40 p.m. One of Alberta’s largest school boards wants the province to open vaccine clinics in schools as the number of students and staff infected with COVID-19 rises.
Trisha Estabrooks, chairwoman of the board for Edmonton Public Schools, says a letter will be sent to the UCP government by the end of the week.
It comes after the board unanimously passed a motion yesterday to try to get more five to 11-year-olds vaccinated and prevent further spread of the Omicron variant in classrooms.
Edmonton Public Schools says on its website that more than five per cent of its 105,787 students were absent yesterday due to COVID-19 — up from four per cent a day earlier.
Alberta Health says about 42 per cent of kids between the age of five and 11 have received a single dose of vaccine and about five per cent have had both doses.
12 p.m. Quebec’s health and welfare commissioner says the province doesn’t need a public inquiry into the high death toll in long-term care homes during the pandemic’s first wave.
Joanne Castonguay told reporters today after releasing her report into senior care that between her investigation, the coroner’s inquest, and the probe by the ombudswoman, Quebec has enough information to make changes to its health system.
Castonguay’s comments are in conflict with Quebec’s opposition leaders, who for months have been calling for a public inquiry to investigate the 4,836 deaths in elder care and long-term care between February 2020 and July 2020.
The commissioner presented the main findings of her report today, which concludes the province was ill prepared to endure the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and that major reforms to the health system are necessary.
11:50 a.m. For the first time, all Americans can log on to a government website and order free, at-home COVID-19 tests. But the White House push may do little to ease the Omicron surge, and experts say Washington will have to do a lot more to fix the country’s long-troubled testing system.
The website, COVIDTests.gov, allows people to order four at-home tests per household and have them delivered by mail. But the tests won’t arrive for seven to 12 days, after Omicron cases are expected to peak in many parts of the U.S.
The White House also announced Wednesday that it will begin making 400 million N95 masks available for free at pharmacies and community health centers. Both initiatives represent the kind of mass government investments long seen in parts of Europe and Asia, but delayed in the U.S.
Experts say the plan to distribute 1 billion tests is a good first step, but it must become a regular part of the pandemic response. In the same way that it has made vaccines are free and plentiful, the government must use its purchasing power to assure a steady test supply, they say.
11:45 a.m. Quebec is reporting 88 additional COVID-19 deaths and a rise of eight hospitalizations linked to the disease.
It’s the lowest daily increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations reported in Quebec since Dec. 17.
The Health Department says 3,425 people are in hospital, after 359 patients were admitted and 351 were discharged.
It says there are 285 people in intensive care, a decline of four from the day before.
Officials report that 6,123 new COVID-19 cases were confirmed in the previous 24 hours.
11:40 a.m. Ontario’s health minister says the province is starting to see “glimmers of hope” in its fight against the Omicron variant of COVID-19.
Christine Elliott says because of that, the government will be making an announcement later this week on the public health measures that were put in place earlier this month.
Elliott says cases are expected to peak this month, with a peak in hospitalizations and ICU admissions to follow.
Dr. Kieran Moore, Ontario’s chief medical officer of health, says the rate of hospitalizations and cases in the intensive care unit are increasing at a slower pace.
He says the average length of stay in hospital for COVID-19 patients is now five days with the Omicron variant, compared to nine days with Delta.
11:36 a.m. The Czech Republic’s new government on Wednesday dismissed the previous government’s plan to require older adults and people in some professions to get vaccinated against the coronavirus.
The previous government, led by Prime Minister Andrej Babis, released an order in early December, making vaccination mandatory for people age 60 and over as well as medical personnel, police officers, firefighters and medical students.
It was due to take effect in March. But Babis’ administration was replaced later in December by a new government formed by five parties and led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala.
“We’ve agreed that vaccination against COVID-19 won’t be mandatory,” Fiala said, stressing that his government still considers the vaccines “the best tool to fight COVID-19.”
10:58 a.m. Ontario Chief Medical Officer Dr. Kieran Moore says that the unvaccinated make up just 10 per cent of the province’s population, but account for 50 per cent of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
10:52 a.m. Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott says the pace of hospitalizations in the province is slowing. She promises more “clarity” on a reopening plan later this week, but warns February will continue to be challenging in hospitals.
10:22 a.m.: A drop-in vaccination clinic is taking place from Wednesday to Sunday at Crossroads Plaza at 2625 Weston Road, North York.
“There are currently no lines for adults or children,” according to a tweet sent by Humber River Hospital on Wednesday at 10:21 a.m.
The clinic says anyone that works, lives or goes to school in “any M postal code” is eligible, with ID.
10:17 a.m. (updated) Ontario is reporting 4,132 people hospitalized with COVID-19, 589 in the ICU and 60 deaths. 53 per cent were admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 and 47 per cent were admitted for other reasons but have tested positive for COVID-19.
The numbers represent a 1.6 per cent increase in the ICU COVID-19 count and a 1.2 per cent decrease in hospitalizations overall. 20.4 per cent of the province’s 2,343 adult ICU beds remain available for new patients.
29,664,874 vaccine doses have been administered in the province, with over 103,000 doses administered yesterday. 91.5 per cent of Ontarians 12+ have one dose and 88.8 per cent have two doses.

9:38 a.m. Ontario’s health minister is set to give an update at 10:30 a.m on public health trends, as the Omicron variant of COVID-19 drives up hospitalizations.
Christine Elliott will be joined at the news conference by the CEO of Ontario Health and Ontario’s chief medical officer of health, who has said he is watching for a peak or plateau of COVID-19 hospitalizations.
Dr. Kieran Moore said last week that the transmission of Omicron in the province may peak in the next few weeks, and increases in hospitalizations and ICU admissions typically happen one or two weeks after infection.
The president and CEO of the Ontario Hospital Association has said that while the province’s hospitals are under immense pressure, the rate of daily admissions has decreased slightly.
9:35 a.m. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has opened a new vaccine manufacturing facility that he says will boost the country’s capacity to make its own inoculations for diseases including COVID-19.
The plant in Cape Town — a partnership between a U.S.-based biotechnology firm, the government and South African universities — will help improve Africa’s ability to produce vaccines, Ramaphosa said Wednesday.
“The pandemic has revealed the huge disparities that exist within and between countries in access to quality healthcare, medicines, diagnostics and vaccines,” said Ramaphosa. Africa is responding to COVID-19 with a “depth of scientific knowledge, expertise and capacity,” to make its own vaccines, he said.
The factory was also launched by Patrick Soon-Shiong, the South African-born founder of NantWorks, a multinational biotechnology firm based in the United States that has invested about $200 million to start the facility, according
9:10 a.m. Students across Ontario are headed back to the classroom Wednesday after a long break from in-person learning. An Omicron-fulled surge in COVID-19 cases forced students into online learning for what, in some ways, turned into a two-week extension of Christmas break.
Schools were set to reopen on Monday but a massive snowstorm that practically brought the province to it’s knees delayed the return to class for many boards, including those in Toronto, for two more days.
Some secondary schools are moving to remote learning Wednesday, including Dr. Norman Bethune CI. Emery CI, John Polanyi CI, Newtonbrook SS and Yorkdale SS, according to the TDSB.
Follow along here for live updates from the Star.
8:15 a.m. The Biden administration, facing calls from public health experts to distribute high-quality masks to the American public, will announce on Wednesday that it is making 400 million nonsurgical N95 masks available, free of charge, at community health centers and retail pharmacies across the United States.
The move, which officials are calling the “largest deployment of personal protective equipment in U.S. history,” comes just days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its mask guidance to acknowledge that cloth masks do not offer as much protection as surgical masks or respirators.
N95 respirators, so named because they can filter out 95% of all airborne particles when used correctly, were in short supply early in the pandemic. According to the CDC’s new description of masks, well-fitting respirators, including N95s, offer the highest level of protection.
7:50 a.m. Amid the confusion of students returning to school as COVID-19 cases surge, Lisa Petsinis said she’s troubled by a suggestion from her daughter’s school about lunchtime: that kids briefly remove their masks to take a bite to eat and put them back on to chew.
A newsletter to parents, which also stressed students will be reminded to maintain physical distancing, “doesn’t say anything about how this is going to be supervised, and I’m not sure if it’s even possible to do,” said Petsinis, whose 14-year-old daughter attends a school in Etobicoke under the Toronto District School Board.
“It’s a big concern because it’s the only time (the kids) are going to be maskless and the Omicron variant is highly contagious. But there just seems to be no focus at all on addressing safety at lunch.”

7:35 a.m. When it comes to third-dose uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine, many of the same problems with access seen throughout the rollout are happening again, with GTA neighbourhoods that have borne the heaviest burden of the pandemic seeing some of the lowest vaccination rates in the province.
Despite efforts by public health to get vaccines into the arms of those in northern Peel Region and Toronto’s hard-hit northwest corner, less than 20 per cent of residents in these areas have received third doses, according to new postal code data from ICES , formerly the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences.
Hot spots in Peel and Toronto make up more than half of the 20 postal codes in Ontario with the lowest third-dose vaccination rates to date. Other areas among those with the lowest rates in the province for third shots include more rural postal codes in Milton, Aylmer and Middlesex-London.

5:45 a.m.: Unvaccinated military members are in for a tougher fight than a retired airman who was disciplined for refusing an anthrax vaccine 20 years ago, his former lawyer warns.
Jay Prober said some in the Canadian Armed Forces who don’t want to take the current COVID-19 vaccines have contacted him because he defended Michael Kipling, the retired sergeant charged and ultimately acquitted of breaching an order to take an anthrax vaccine while serving in Kuwait.
“This would be much, much tougher and a much steeper mountain to climb,” the Winnipeg-based lawyer said in a recent interview.
“It’s completely different, quite frankly,”
Controversy over mandatory vaccinations for the military has re-emerged during the pandemic, with Chief of the Defence Staff Gen. Wayne Eyre ordering all personnel to be inoculated against COVID-19.
Back in March 1998, troops serving in Kuwait City near Iraq’s border were ordered to take an anthrax vaccine out of concern it could be used as a biological weapon.
That gave rise to the conflict with Kipling, a flight engineer who refused to be vaccinated because the vaccine was unlicensed in Canada, he had fallen ill after an earlier shot and feared the vaccine could be connected to an unexplained sickness other veterans experienced.
The doctor tasked with immunizing soldiers at that time was Stephen Ellis, the physician-turned-Conservative MP, who now assists Tory leader Erin O’Toole on shaping pandemic-related policies.
5:44 a.m.: The Omicron-fuelled fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic appears to be peaking in some provinces, while others say the worst is likely still to come.
The Saskatchewan Health Authority says it is bracing for a tide of COVID-19 hospitalizations and absenteeism among workers until mid-February, while Alberta says hospitalization rates are rising to levels not seen since mid-October.
The growing number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in Prince Edward Island has prompted the province to reduce gathering sizes and close gyms and restaurant dining rooms until at least the end of the month.
Even as they both set new records for hospitalizations, officials in Ontario and Quebec say the daily rate seems to be decreasing slightly, although they caution the health-care system remains under tremendous pressure.
There are 3,417 COVID patients in Quebec hospitals, while Ontario has 4,183, including 580 people in intensive care.
B.C. recorded 1,975 cases of COVID-19 with 854 people in hospital, as the province’s top doctor described her decision to allow the reopening of gyms and other fitness facilities Thursday as a “cautious step’’ in lifting COVID-19 restrictions.
Dr. Bonnie Henry said a proof-of-vaccination card will still be required to use gyms, and the facilities will need to operate under capacity limits and provide seven metres square for every person who is exercising.
5:43 a.m.: Ontario’s largest school board is to resume holding classes in-person today.
The Toronto District School Board said last night that classes were set to go ahead after a snowstorm disrupted those plans on Monday and Tuesday.
The city’s Catholic school board also said it would open for in-person learning but warned that buses may be affected by cleanup from the storm that affected back-to-school plans across southern and eastern Ontario.
Students had been learning remotely since the beginning of the month after a major surge in COVID-19 cases set in, straining the province’s health system and labour force.
Students returned to classes earlier in the week in some regions in the province’s north and southwest.
Teachers and students are returning with little information on COVID-19 cases in schools and limited access to PCR tests after the province shifted its policies to preserve resources.
5:43 a.m.: Laurentian University President Robert Haché says on-campus course delivery will be delayed until at least Jan. 30.
The university said it will be working with local health authorities to create a plan for a staged return to in-person learning that “could begin as early as Feb. 7.”
“Laurentian University will always seek to provide an excellent on-campus student experience,” said Haché.
“Recently, the pandemic caused us to pivot to remote learning and though we would like to return to face-to-face learning, it has not yet been deemed safe to do so by local health authorities.”
The university said it will be able to provide further information on the staged return to campus by Jan. 21.
“Our goal will be to provide two weeks of notice before on-campus learning resumes. Student services will continue to operate remotely until it is safe to deliver them on-campus,” said the statement.
“We realize there are many challenges as a result of these changes, some have preferred remote delivery, and some are eager to return. I would ask that we have empathy for our colleagues, our peers, and especially our students.”
Haché said the university will do everything possible to “continue to provide the in-person experience that is core to the student journey.”
5:42 a.m.: New mask requirements come into effect on Monday for anyone accessing the Cambrian College campus in Sudbury.
“We ask that you wear a three-ply disposable mask or non-fit-tested KN95 mask when inside the college and outside on the college property when physical distancing can’t be maintained,” said the college in a social media post.
Cloth masks will no longer be permitted unless they are worn over a three-ply disposable or KN95 mask.
Anyone who does not have access to three-ply disposable or KN95 masks can ask for one at the front desk, said the college.
Cambrian College president Bill Best also announced that the college will not be transitioning theory courses back to in-person delivery on Jan. 31 as planned in an update posted to the college’s website.
“Instead, for the full winter 2022 term, all theory courses will be delivered virtually, with only necessary hands-on labs being delivered in person and on campus,” said the update.
“There will be a few exceptions to this approach, and those students will have already been contacted directly by their academic areas. This decision will allow students and faculty to plan ahead with certainty.”
5:41 a.m.: Public Health Sudbury and Districts announced a new location for COVID-19 mass immunizations clinics on Manitoulin Island on Tuesday.
Beginning on Jan. 20, all mass immunization clinics that were previously scheduled at the Manitoulin Information Centre in Little Current will move to the Four Directions Complex, located on 1300 ON-540 in Aundeck Omni Kaning.
The new mass immunization clinic will be held in partnership with Noojmowin Teg Health Centre, Mnaamodzawin Health Services, and local family health teams.
“Dates and times of scheduled appointments are not affected by the location change unless you are called and receive confirmation of a new appointment time,” a release said.
“This location change applies to all previously scheduled appointments at the Manitoulin Tourist Information Centre. All other vaccination clinic locations on Manitoulin Island, including clinics at the Mindemoya Missionary Church and M’Chigeeng Community Complex, are not impacted by this location change.”
5:40 a.m.: The Biden administration will begin making 400 million N95 masks available for free to Americans starting next week, now that federal officials are emphasizing their better protection against the omicron variant of COVID-19 over cloth face coverings.
The White House announced Wednesday that the masks will come from the government’s Strategic National Stockpile, which has more than 750 million of the highly protective masks on hand. The masks will be available for pickup at pharmacies and community health centres across the country. They will begin shipping this week for distribution starting late next week, the White House said.
This will be the largest distribution of free masks by the federal government to the public since the COVID-19 pandemic began. In early 2020, then-President Donald Trump’s administration considered and then shelved plans to send masks to all American at their homes. President Joe Biden embraced the initiative after facing mounting criticism this month over the inaccessibility — both in supply and cost — of N95 masks as the highly transmissible omicron variant swept across the country.
After facing similar criticism over a winter shortage of COVID-19 at-home test kits, Biden this week launched a website for Americans to order four rapid tests to be shipped to their homes for free, with the first tests to ship later this month.
The White House said the masks will be made available at pharmacies and community health centres that have partnered with the federal government’s COVID-19 vaccination campaign.
5:37 a.m.: The Japanese government will place Tokyo and a dozen other areas under new restrictions for COVID-19 effective Friday, allowing local leaders to shorten hours for eateries, as a surge in omicron cases threatens to paralyze society.
A government-commissioned experts’ panel on Wednesday approved a plan to put the 13 areas under a three-week restraint through Feb. 13, said Economy Revitalization Minister Daishiro Yamagiwa, who is also in charge of virus measures.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is expected to officially announce the new measures at a government task force meeting later Wednesday.
Wednesday 5:36 a.m.: Is it better to wear an N95 or cloth mask right now?
Health experts suggest stepping up protection against the highly contagious omicron variant with stronger masks such as N95s or KN95s.
It’s especially important now with health care systems under strain, and with people in higher-risk situations such as crowded, indoor settings for extended periods, says Linsey Marr, who studies viruses at Virginia Tech.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently updated its guidance to recommend the kinds of masks used by health care workers, but also noted it’s important to pick a mask that fits well and that you’ll wear consistently.
“Our main message continues to be that any mask is better than no mask,” CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund said in a statement.

Full text: Across Greater Toronto on Monday, thousands of citizens did the neighbourly thing, shovelling a senior's walk, helping push marooned cars from snowdrifts, giving someone a lift.
Doubtless there were jokes, laughs, thanks and cheery "no problems." Help happily - and anonymously - given.
Only one citizen seems to have made a multimedia, self-promotional meal of it.
That, of course, was Premier Doug Ford.
And in the performative exercise, in the misplaced focus, in the sham of it all was to be found much that's wrong about the Ford family in public life.
First was the premier's disregard of the express instructions of police and emergency services.
They had asked people to stay off roads so emergency services could operate. They reminded drivers to avoid distractions at the wheel.
But there was the premier, like some wannabe superhero, trolling the streets of Etobicoke, conducting FaceTime interviews with a TV reporter while driving.
Doug Ford has been largely missing in action over the recent difficult weeks of the pandemic and the challenge of reopening schools.
Hospitals and emergency services are stretched almost to the point of collapse.
His former long-term care minister jumped ship in the midst of the pandemic, just months before an election.
There are many large, serious issues that it's the premier's job to address.
Instead, Ford - eager for applause and adulation - was out on the streets with a shovel like some small-town ward heeler.
The Fords are good at that sort of thing, as the late mayor Rob Ford showed years before his brother became premier. Retail politics is their trademark. But it's not the job of high office. And in Doug Ford's case it was done more for his benefit than for anyone else's.
The video posted of Ford shovelling was critiqued on social media like a last-ditch football play and the premier seemed to demonstrate precious little experience at the task, rather like Donald Trump holding a Bible.
He shoved snow backwards between his legs, into his boots, back onto the road, clearing a patch well behind the rear tires and of no discernible use in getting the stalled car in motion.
Then there was a TikTok video posted by @eddykandic95 in which the premier is seen giving a young man a lift.
"I'm the taxi driver today and snow plow and everything else," Ford chirped. The operative word in the sentence being "I."
Neither man, in the enclosed space of a car's front seats, was wearing a mask.
The Fords never played by the rules, frequently acting as if they were above the law.
The Peel Paramedic Union tweeted out a reminder to the premier that when authorities advise against being on the roads and against distracted driving, "We are talking to you @fordnation."
If Ford wants to do their jobs, the union said, maybe it should be allowed "to run the government long enough to fix the mess he has made."
The premier was unapologetic.
"Just making sure people are safe in their cars and anything I can do to help them," Ford told a TV host from his car.
What the premier could have done to make people safe was stay off the roads, stay off his phone and TV, wear a mask.
Then he might have had time for doing his real job.

Toronto to launch $12M 'safety and well-being' plan to combat community violence, support mental health

Full text: On the heels of one of Toronto’s bloodiest years, the city’s 10-year community safety and well-being plan will launch with just over $12 million in funding if city council approves.
The new “SafeTO” program is the latest, significant effort to funnel resources to neighbourhoods struggling with gun violence and other crises after similar plans previously approved by council have seen a lack of political will and funding.
This time around, the 2022 work plan proposes: the launching of non-police crisis teams to respond to mental health calls in a pilot project; bolstering the work of a team that responds to community needs after gunfire; and creating a new office dedicated to preventing gun violence.
“We all want a safer Toronto,” said Mayor John Tory said in a planned press conference Wednesday to endorse the strategy.
“This report makes it clear that this is a top priority and that we are prepared as a city to put the resources and the people behind it to make it happen.”
The proposal going to Tory’s executive committee on Jan. 26 comes after the province rewrote the Police Services Act to focus on community-driven approaches to safety in 2019. Under those changes, all municipalities were required to prepare community safety plans by 2021, which Toronto did.
But the new Community Safety and Policing Act does not require funding for those plans from the province nor has Premier Doug Ford’s government committed any.
The city’s plan to implement SafeTO comes after another pandemic year with more than 80 homicides — one of the highest tallies in recent decades — more than half of them involving guns. Already this year, four of seven homicides have seen victims under the age of 25.
The city’s funding must be approved separately as part of the city’s overall budget process. It is currently included in the budget proposed by city staff.
While $12 million is a small slice of the city’s overall $15-billion operating budget, it would be a significant step for council.
It took years for the city to say it was fully implementing the $15-million Toronto Youth Equity Strategy to combat youth violence, first approved in 2014.
And a previous 10-year anti-gun violence plan approved by city council in 2014, totalling $50 million, relied entirely on funding from the other levels of government. Today, it remains largely unfunded despite election promises from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberals.
“We’ve been patiently pursuing that, minister after minister, election after election,” Tory said during his press conference. “It’s time, I think, for that money to come forward.”
The three programs recommended for funding this year look at key areas in need of immediate response as well as a central hub to co-ordinate efforts and collect data to inform city policy and strategy.
The crisis-team pilot project acknowledges police are not always required or wanted to see peaceful outcomes following painful tragedies for Black and Indigenous residents and people of colour in Toronto.
It will see local, established organizations like the Black Health Alliance working together in four different areas of the city to provide critical and appropriate supports for people experiencing a mental health crisis. Each area will have mobile teams of community health nurses, crisis counsellors and others who work around the clock, and relevant followup services.
The SafeTO plan will add $8.6 million in funding for that program.
A separate community crisis response program, which has been operating since 2008, will also get a boost. After gunfire incidents, this team moves in to work with local communities in a culturally sensitive way to access psychological services, community debriefs, peer support groups and other supports as needed.
With a 39 per cent increase in firearm-related incidents between 2017 and 2020, the city implementation plan says, the team does not have the kind of surge capacity it needs to properly respond. Funding of just over $2 million will be used to hire six full-time positions to allow a more nimble seven-day model.
Lastly, the city is looking to create a Toronto Office to Prevent Gun Violence, based on successful models in London, Oakland and elsewhere. Funding of $1.4 million would allow different city officials — from police to school boards — to co-ordinate the response to and prevention of these incidents and collect centralized data to better inform real-time decisions about how to deploy resources as well as understand why there is conflict in neighbourhoods, among other efforts.
The city plan to establish a gun violence prevention office was welcomed by Ottawa-based criminologist Irvin Waller, author of “Science and Secrets of Ending Violent Crime” who has, for years, been advocating for such an approach.
“I think that is extraordinarily good news, if we are ever going to see a significant reduction in the numbers of people killed by gun violence and the numbers of people injured and traumatized by gun violence,” Waller said.
He noted, however, that the proposed staffing level — nine full-time employees — was a minimum of what’s likely to be required.
“This is so overdue.”

Full text: Alexa McDonough might have been amused to see the spirited debate that erupted on social media after news of her death was announced over the weekend.
It all revolved around which trails McDonough blazed for women in positions of political leadership in Canada - could the former leader of the NDP really be described as a "first" in that league?
That may be beside the point. McDonough's main achievement, at least at the national level, could well lie in her 1995 victory as the second woman to be elected to lead a federal political party. In what was definitely a break from the past and still-current tradition, the New Democrats replaced one woman leader - Audrey McLaughlin - with another one, McDonough.
Incredibly, that remains a rare accomplishment in politics at many levels. "We tried that once" continues to be a real thing with female political leadership, even now, about three decades since two of Canada's major national parties experimented with women in charge.
Kim Campbell is still the one and only woman who was elected to the leadership of the federal Conservatives; the federal Liberals have yet to choose a woman leader. In the United States, Hillary Clinton's experience appeared to scare the Democrats away from another woman at the helm for the 2020 contest and perhaps well into the future, too.
In short, in the 21st century, the challenge for women isn't getting the big jobs - it's keeping them there.
This phenomenon is probably at the front of my mind right now because I recently read a review copy of Kate Graham's new book, "No Second Chances," which explores a bizarre reality in Canada.
Here it is: Only 13 women have led governments in this country, and not one was re-elected. That's correct. Not one.
"There are concerning similarities in their stories," the book jacket states. "Women tend to reach the top only in challenging political circumstances; they last in the top job for about half as long as men do; and, when they run for re-election, they lose."
Graham's book, due out this spring, is based on a podcast she hosted, featuring interviews with all 13 - from Campbell to B.C.'s Christy Clark to Kathleen Wynne in Ontario. Graham is a former provincial candidate herself, who ran unsuccessfully in London, Ont., during the 2018 election, when Wynne was trying to get re-elected, and later ran to succeed her as Liberal leader.
I remember being at the 1995 leadership convention in Ottawa when McDonough was chosen and I recall my own surprise that the NDP would replace one woman with another one. This was just a couple of years after the 1993 federal election that featured two women leaders: McLaughlin and Campbell.
Both parties led by women failed to win even official party status in the Commons - the mighty Conservatives were reduced to just two seats, and the New Democrats won nine. Coincidence? Maybe, but there was lots of talk back then about whether either party would have fared better under male leaders.
Many women have been coming forward since McDonough's passing over the weekend to talk about the ways in which she encouraged others to see politics as a world that was open to them.
The best story, though, may have come from Megan Leslie, the former NDP MP from Halifax, who spoke on CBC's "Sunday Magazine" about how she went to McDonough for advice after a colleague made a casually sexist remark.
McDonough told her to "suck it up" - that this was normal in the rough and tumble world of politics. Many of us who were around in the 1980s and 1990s remember getting that kind of advice, and possibly even dispensing it, too. That's what happens after you break into a world as an outsider: you learn the rules, stay quiet and wait for critical mass of others to make things better.
Leslie spoke of how McDonough came to her much later, after leaving Ottawa, to say she regretted that counsel. Progress for women in politics, McDonough realized, depends not in being a novelty, but about changing ideas - even your own ideas - about how the system works.
I like to think McDonough would be most proud not just of when she came first, but what she represented in terms of succession for women leaders. The goalposts have shifted since all those "firsts" of the 20th century, from getting women into the top jobs, to getting used to them being there.
McDonough helped the NDP crack that "tried it once" barrier, showing that it is possible for women in top jobs to be more than a temporary novelty. In a country that still isn't that great at giving women second chances in the top spots, that's a legacy achievement on its own.

Martin Regg Cohn: Doug Ford has lost his minister of competence. Now what?

Full text: With future leadership challenger Rod Phillips suddenly quitting cabinet, Doug Ford is no longer looking over his shoulder.
But the premier has just lost the eyes in the back of his head. Phillips was the minister of competence who could see around corners in a government that goes by its gut.
Now, with the June 2 election looming, Ford is alone at the wheel — just as he was during Monday’s snowstorm. Those televised images of the premier in the driver’s seat doing FaceTime interviews in between digging out snowbound motorists in Etobicoke spoke volumes.
Whenever Ford’s Tories dug themselves into a hole, they relied on Phillips to help them stop digging and find a way out of the storm. This week with Phillips gone, Ford was back digging himself in deeper for all to see.
Ford long ago invited voters to just ring his cellphone if they had a problem, until his staff talked him out of treating the premier’s office like a call centre. Now it’s back to help lines and towing lines.
On the campaign trail ahead, the premier will be flying by the seat of his pants without Phillips looking out for him — and telling him where to turn next. The story of how this patrician partisan came to be at the premier’s side, and then fell by the wayside, could tell the tale of Ford’s future.
By quitting now, on the eve of an election and in the midst of a pandemic, Phillips is depriving the Progressive Conservatives of the competence card when the government needs it most. And the province depends on it more than ever.
Why did Phillips want to leave now? Why did Ford let him go?
Four years ago, when his first provincial election campaign was faltering as his populist schtick fell flat, Ford turned to Phillips for help. At a campaign event in Newmarket, the party pointedly showcased the brains behind the aspiring premier.
Phillips was front and centre, reassuring voters that the party was qualified to govern. But the premier came to rely ever more heavily on Phillips lending a steady hand for shaky assignments.
His background as a former political aide, successful entrepreneur, public servant, media executive, and philanthropic leader — and an old school Red Tory — made him a good fit for the realities of governing after the fantasies of Ford’s populist crusade. But Phillips, too, had his blind spots.
He climbed the greasy flagpole of government, then tumbled down, then clambered back up again, and is now jumping off. His rise and fall and recovery spans the ups and downs of this government.
First, at the environment portfolio, the rookie minister had to somehow make sense of Ford’s nonsensical promise to eliminate a “carbon tax” that didn’t exist in Ontario. Phillips was made to cancel the province’s more efficient “cap and trade” regime — which triggered, by default, a federal carbon tax that endures to this day.
He survived that assignment by mastering the minutiae of carbon targets while studiously ignoring the big picture realities. But it was political art, not environmental science — and not his finest hour.
A grateful Ford rewarded Phillips for his loyalty by elevating him to finance minister to stabilize his government after its first bungled budget. His competence was exceeded only by his over-confidence when Phillips made the fateful mistake of slipping away to the Caribbean for a Christmas getaway in late 2020, leaving behind pre-taped video greetings from his office.
In exile, Phillips licked his wounds and awaited rehabilitation. When the call came to return to cabinet, he was handed the hardest assignment that no one else wanted — long-term care.
Phillips proved a quick study, moving rapidly on the problems that could be fixed fast. He persuaded his fellow ministers to mandate vaccines for long-term care workers who had long resisted them, and found the funds for more beds.
Why bail out now? Is Phillips abandoning a sinking ship?
More likely he has calculated that Ford is on track to be re-elected on June 2 and not going anywhere after that. That would leave Phillips doing more of the same — looking out for a premier who likes to be in the driver’s seat in a snowstorm.
That’s not what Phillips signed up for when he was recruited by previous PC leader Patrick Brown to cobble together a Red Tory platform, which Ford promptly ripped up. In truth, he has always nursed ambitions to one day inherit the helm, briefly flirting with a leadership run in early 2018 until he was quickly overshadowed by the high-profile Ford.
Unlike the premier, whose first allegiance has always been to his imagined Ford Nation ahead of his provincial PCs, Phillips has always styled himself a party loyalist — and, yes, future leader. Friday’s resignation statement noted pointedly that he’d called the PC Party president and not just notified the premier.
Why didn’t a forward-looking Ford try to talk him out of it? Perhaps he was still looking over his shoulder.
After his downfall a year ago, Phillips was damaged goods politically — many of his erstwhile allies stopped reaching out. He had gone from political anonymity to notoriety in one news cycle.
I wrote then that his dream of becoming premier had faded forever. But I’m almost always wrong.
At 56, Phillips is now telling us he’s gone for good. Note that he never said “Never.”

Full text: Paul Calandra takes over as Ontario’s fourth long-term care minister in four years as the Omicron variant puts nursing homes under the spotlight again with a provincial election just months away.
There were no resident deaths reported from COVID-19 in November and 10 in December as experts warned of the Omicron risk. The toll has risen sharply to 61 this month in a sector that accounts for about 4,000 pandemic fatalities.
Despite mandatory vaccination policies and a fourth dose effort , hundreds of residents and staff are catching the highly contagious strain following a lull in the fall when there were fewer cases.
“Once again, we are hearing from residents, their families and front-line staff of mass staff shortages, and residents confined to rooms for days, even weeks, at a time,” New Democrat Leader Andrea Horwath wrote Monday in a letter to Premier Doug Ford.
Almost 4,100 nurses, personal support workers and other staff are themselves fighting active cases of COVID — the highest number since the start of the pandemic — raising concerns care will decline.
“I don’t know what is replacing that care,” said caregiver advocate Vivian Stamatopoulos, a university professor who liaises with families. Stamatopoulos warned that staffing shortages increases the risks of medication errors, untreated illnesses and isolation in residents.
Calandra (Markham-Stouffville), a small businessman and insurance broker before entering politics, was appointed Friday after his predecessor, Rod Phillips , unexpectedly announced he will be retiring from politics.
“Minister Calandra continues to be briefed and updated by officials about the current situation in long-term care,” spokeswoman Vanessa De Matteis said Monday.
There are about 2,600 residents with active cases and just over half of Ontario’s 626 nursing homes have outbreaks, although 73 of them had no resident cases.
The high-profile portfolio is in addition to Calandra’s roles as minister of legislative affairs and government house leader, steering Ford’s agenda through the legislature.
Donna Duncan of the Ontario Long-Term Care Association, which represents 70 per cent of nursing homes, said staffing levels remain her biggest concern at a time when hospitals are also experiencing staff shortages and can’t help out as they did in the second wave of COVID.
That situation has prompted nursing homes to ask local doctor’s offices and family health teams for help with vaccinations and to local restaurants and community college culinary programs for help with meals if they have lost kitchen staff to the virus.
“They’ve reached out to family members (of residents) to hire them to assist,” Duncan added. “These are temporary emergency measures.”
Duncan said help from the province has improved dramatically from the deadly first wave of COVID, when some homes saw staff levels fall as low as 20 per cent from absenteeism and illness, prompting Ford to call for help from military medical teams. Those teams found horrific conditions such as residents malnourished, dehydrated, left in dirty diapers for long periods crying for help, and given expired medications.
Horwath and Green Leader Mike Schreiner urged Ford to take away Calandra’s other responsibilities so he can focus on nursing homes.
“We need a minister who is solely focused on long-term care because we are in a crisis,” Schreiner told a news conference.
Ford created a separate ministry of long-term care in 2019 after breaking it off from the ministry of health under Health Minister Christine Elliott months before the pandemic hit. Former family doctor Merrilee Fullerton took on the portfolio and was replaced by Phillips last spring after a controversial tenure.

Susan Delacourt: For Alexa McDonough, being second was a first in Canadian politics

Full text: Alexa McDonough might have been amused to see the spirited debate that erupted on social media after news of her death was announced over the weekend.
It all revolved around which trails McDonough blazed for women in positions of political leadership in Canada — could the former leader of the NDP really be described as a “first” in that league?
That may be beside the point. McDonough’s main achievement, at least at the national level, could well lie in her 1995 victory as the second woman to be elected to lead a federal political party. In what was definitely a break from the past and still-current tradition, the New Democrats replaced one woman leader — Audrey McLaughlin — with another one, McDonough.
Incredibly, that remains a rare accomplishment in politics at many levels. “We tried that once” continues to be a real thing with female political leadership, even now, about three decades since two of Canada’s major national parties experimented with women in charge.
Kim Campbell is still the one and only woman who was elected to the leadership of the federal Conservatives; the federal Liberals have yet to choose a woman leader. In the United States, Hillary Clinton’s experience appeared to scare the Democrats away from another woman at the helm for the 2020 contest and perhaps well into the future too.
In short, in the 21st century, the challenge for women isn’t getting the big jobs — it’s keeping them there.
This phenomenon is probably at the front of my mind right now because I recently read a review copy of Kate Graham’s new book, “No Second Chances,” which explores a bizarre reality in Canada.
Here it is: Only 13 women have led governments in this country, and not one was re-elected. That’s correct. Not one.
“There are concerning similarities in their stories,” the book jacket states. “Women tend to reach the top only in challenging political circumstances; they last in the top job for about half as long as men do; and, when they run for re-election, they lose.”
Graham’s book, due out this spring, is based on a podcast she hosted, featuring interviews with all 13 — from Campbell to B.C.’s Christy Clark to Kathleen Wynne in Ontario. Graham is a former provincial candidate herself, who ran unsuccessfully in London, Ont during the 2018 election, when Wynne was trying to get re-elected, and later ran to succeed her as Liberal leader.
I remember being at the 1995 leadership convention in Ottawa when McDonough was chosen and I recall my own surprise that the NDP would replace one woman with another one. This was just a couple of years after the 1993 federal election that featured two women leaders: McLaughlin and Campbell.
Both parties led by women failed to win even official party status in the Commons — the mighty Conservatives were reduced to just two seats, and the New Democrats won nine. Coincidence? Maybe, but there was lots of talk back then about whether either party would have fared better under male leaders.
Many women have been coming forward since McDonough’s passing over the weekend to talk about the ways in which she encouraged others to see politics as a world that was open to them.
The best story, though, may have come from Megan Leslie, the former NDP MP from Halifax, who spoke on CBC’s “Sunday Magazine” about how she went to McDonough for advice after a colleague made a casually sexist remark.
McDonough told her to “suck it up” — that this was normal in the rough and tumble world of politics. Many of us who were around in the 1980s and 1990s remember getting that kind of advice, and possibly even dispensing it, too. That’s what happens after you break into a world as an outsider: you learn the rules, stay quiet and wait for critical mass of others to make things better.
Leslie spoke of how McDonough came to her much later, after leaving Ottawa, to say she regretted that counsel. Progress for women in politics, McDonough realized, depends not in being a novelty, but about changing ideas — even your own ideas — about how the system works.
I like to think McDonough would be most proud not just of when she came first, but what she represented in terms of succession for women leaders. The goalposts have shifted since all those “firsts” of the 20th century, from getting women into the top jobs, to getting used to them being there.
McDonough helped the NDP crack that “tried it once” barrier, showing that it is possible for women in top jobs to be more than a temporary novelty. In a country that still isn’t that great at giving women second chances in the top spots, that’s a legacy achievement on its own.

Full text: The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Sunday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available.
9:10 p.m.: COVID-19 infections are soaring again at U.S. nursing homes because of the omicron wave, and deaths are climbing too, leading to new restrictions on family visits and a renewed push to get more residents and staff members vaccinated and boosted.
Nursing homes were the lethal epicenter of the pandemic early on, before the vaccine allowed many of them to reopen to visitors last year. But the wildly contagious variant has dealt them a setback.
Nursing homes reported a near-record of about 32,000 COVID-19 cases among residents in the week ending Jan. 9, an almost sevenfold increase from a month earlier, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
A total of 645 COVID-19-related deaths among residents were recorded during the same week, a 47 per cent increase from the earlier period. And there are fears that deaths could go much higher before omicron is through.
Despite the rising numbers, the situation is not as dire as it was in December 2020, when nursing home deaths per week topped out at about 6,200. Experts credit the high vaccination rates now among nursing home residents: About 87 per cent are fully vaccinated, according to CDC data.
8:30 p.m.: Toronto mother Sara Marlowe spent part of the weekend helping her kids prepare for a return to in-person learning on Monday, when schools across the province were set to reopen.
Knapsacks were packed, lunches were made and an outdoor eating schedule was in the works.
“We will be sending them back, and it’s with reservations,” said Marlowe, whose children Adalyn, 6, and Beckett, 11, attend Dewson Street Junior Public School. “I’m just so angry that we are put in this position ... We’ve been left scrambling.”
Last week Ontario announced schools would open Monday to the province’s two million students, who were forced to learn online after the winter break. School was initially delayed by two days and scheduled to reopen Jan. 5, but then Premier Doug Ford warned of a “tsunami” of COVID cases, due to the highly transmissible Omicron variant, and ordered a pivot to remote learning until at least Jan. 17.
On Sunday, Environment Canada issued a winter storm and snowfall warning for parts of southern Ontario expected overnight and on Monday, threatening to further postpone a return to in-person learning, and extend virtual learning.

7:12 p.m.: Austria will impose fines on those without COVID-19 vaccinations from mid-March after a transition phase that starts in February, said Chancellor Karl Nehammer.
People unwilling to get inoculated will face penalties of as much as 3,600 euros ($4,108), the Austrian leader told reporters on Sunday. The mandate will apply to all adults living in the country except when a medical exemption is granted.
Austria’s policy is being closely watched as a model for similar ambitions in other European Union countries. Italy has imposed a vaccine mandate on people age 50 or over, Greece will start fining seniors who don’t get their shots, and French President Emmanuel Macron has pledged to make life difficult for the unvaccinated.
In the first phase of Austria’s policy, the unvaccinated will get written notification. Starting in mid-March, police and other officials will start checking vaccine status, imposing fines, and ordering vaccine appointments if necessary. Continued dissent will prompt another 600 euro fine after a month.
Fines can be reversed by taking a vaccine within two weeks of being identified.
Nehammer, a former interior minister propelled into the top job after months of political limbo in Austria, has been working on fine-tuning a policy critics say will be difficult to enforce without excessive controls on the public.
More than 20,000 people marched on the streets of Vienna on Saturday in the latest protest against the plan, which has become a key campaign theme for the right-wing Freedom Party. The government also received more than 100,000 comments, many from those opposed to mandates, during a public consultation for the bill on vaccinations.
“I know there was a lot of speculation that this would be a half-hearted quasi-solution,” Nehammer said on Sunday.
Instead, he said, “the controls will have consequences,” and those who don’t comply “will face high fines.”
5:59 p.m.: A BC Ferries spokesman is encouraging passengers to check online for possible service disruptions before heading to a terminal.
Dan McIntosh says several factors could lead to sailing cancellations on some routes, including employees being sick with COVID-19, seasonal cold and flu or severe winter storms.
Four sailings were cancelled yesterday on the Queen of Cowichan between Horseshoe Bay and Nanaimo due to staffing issues.
McIntosh says some sailings can still go ahead even when there’s a shortage of employees but that depends on whether that’s the captain, engineers or a cook.
He says fewer kitchen staff may mean less cafeteria service, but a ferry can’t sail without key staff.
McIntosh says BC Ferries has contingency plans in place as requested by the provincial health officer to deal with a rise in absenteeism as the Omicron variant sweeps through the province, and that includes cross-training staff to do other duties or deploying them to different locations.
“All it takes is for a few people to be sick, depending on the role they play on the ferries, and then all of a sudden that augments your schedules in a way that we’ve seen. And we can say, anecdotally, that because of the COVID situation, we know that that is impacting our staff.”
He says service notices are posted online as soon as possible when sailings won’t be going ahead as scheduled because so many customers are dependent on the service to get to work, school and medical appointments.
Passengers can check the BC Ferries website for any cancellations before heading to a terminal or register to get notices sent to their mobile device.
4:57 p.m.: Newfoundland and Labrador is reporting one new death as a result of COVID-19.
In a tweet today, health officials say a woman over 70 years of age has died in the Eastern Health region which includes St. John’s.
The death is the 26th in the province since the onset of the pandemic.
A total of 12 people are currently hospitalized with COVID-19.
Officials reported 384 new infections Sunday, including 272 in the Eastern Health region, 54 in Central Health, 43 in Western Health and five in Labrador-Grenfell Health, while another 10 people tested positive at private clinics.
The province currently has 5,503 active cases of the virus.
4:54 p.m.: Thousands of elementary and high school students are set to return to in-person learning across Quebec on Monday, but parents say they’re concerned the province hasn’t done enough to ensure classrooms safety amid COVID-19’s virulent fifth wave.
Premier François Legault announced last week he would proceed with a plan to reopen schools to in-person learning on Jan. 17 even as pandemic-related infection rates and hospitalizations continue to mount provincewide.
The government promised a suite of protective measures to ensure a safe return — such as mandatory masking indoors and 7.2 million rapid tests to be deployed in elementary schools — but several parents say they are not reassured.
Among them is Cheryl Cooperman, a Montreal psychologist and mother of two, whose eight and 11-year-old children won’t be returning to a physical classroom on Monday.
She says the situation is too critical for the children to be back in schools without additional measures, and will at least wait until her kids are adequately vaccinated.
“I don’t know why Quebec always has to reinvent the wheel,” Cooperman said on Sunday. “We know surgical masks aren’t as protective, so it’s what? By magic? By magic, the children will be protected here in Quebec and aren’t going to get COVID?”
Cooperman wrote and co-signed an open letter to the provincial government on Saturday in which she denounced what she described as inconsistent public health measures.
The letter questions the logic behind closing schools in December, when cases had not reached their peak, only to reopen them now as infection rates continue to soar. The province reported 5,946 new cases of COVID-19 on Sunday, along with 21 more deaths related to the virus.
4:52 p.m.: New Brunswick is reporting four new deaths related to COVID-19 today.
Health officials say a person in their 50s has died in the Saint John region as well as a person in their 60s in the Edmundston area.
Two other people have also died in the Bathurst region, including an individual in their 60s and a person in their 70s.
The province has had 187 deaths since the onset of the pandemic.
Officials also say 115 people have been hospitalized due to an infection, with 14 of those patients in intensive care, including four who are on a ventilator.
They reported 380 new cases of COVID-19 and 5,265 active cases.
3:58 p.m.: Federal and state officials warned last week of coronavirus testing scams that have taken advantage of the United States’ strained testing infrastructure and have left Americans with invalid test results, wrongful medical bills and overpriced at-home tests.
Fraud related to the virus has persisted since the onset of the pandemic, but the rapid spread of the omicron variant has created opportunities for scammers preying on the high demand for tests.
On Friday, the Better Business Bureau issued an alert about phony websites and pop-up testing sites that collect people’s personal information, swab them for a test and then never provide results.
Attorneys general in Oregon, New Mexico and Illinois advised residents last week to use only authorized virus testing centers — which are typically listed on city, state and county government websites or recommended by a primary care doctor — because of scams at pop-up testing sites and online.
“The huge demand for COVID-19 testing of all kinds — at-home tests, rapid antigen tests, PCR tests — brings bad actors and some businesses trying to make a quick buck out from the shadows,” said Ellen Rosenblum, the Oregon attorney general, in a statement Wednesday.
Rosenblum said residents should be cautious about pop-up testing sites that ask for personal information, such as a Social Security number, which is not necessary for testing or billing. She said the state was also seeing price gouging for at-home tests sold online.
2:48 p.m.: Dr. Vivek Murthy, the U.S. surgeon general, on Sunday warned that the omicron surge of coronavirus cases had not yet peaked nationally, saying that the next few weeks would be very difficult in many parts of the country as hospitalizations and deaths rise.
In an interview on CNN's “State of the Union,” Murthy noted the “good news” of the plateaus and drops in known cases in the Northeast, especially in New York City and New Jersey.
But “the challenge is that the entire country is not moving at the same pace,” he said, adding that “we shouldn’t expect a national peak in the coming days.”
“The next few weeks will be tough,” he said.
The highly contagious omicron variant has fueled an explosive surge of known cases, with an average of more than 800,000 new cases a day reported Saturday, according to a New York Times database.
Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, also expressed concerns that the next several weeks would overwhelm hospitals and staff. “Right now, we’re at about 150,000 people in the hospital with COVID,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’s more than we’ve ever had. I expect those numbers to get substantially higher.”
In addition, omicron has brought into sharp relief the long-standing lack of adequate testing supplies, with consumers now depleting pharmacies of costly rapid tests — a boxed set of two tests ranges from $14 to $24 — and creating long lines at testing sites.
The federal government has promised to distribute 1 billion rapid at-home coronavirus tests to Americans, limiting each household to request four free tests. And new federal rules require private insurers to cover up to eight at-home tests per member a month.
2:15 p.m.: As students prepare to return to in-person classes on Monday, the president of the Nova Scotia teachers union says he has “severe doubts” whether schools will remain open until the end of the week.
Paul Wozney says he believes the governmetn has been “overselling” its plan to help schools remain open as the Omicron variant of COVID-19 continues to sweep through the province.
Wozney says schools had to be closed earlier than anticipated before the holiday break when staffing levels couldn’t be maintained with daily case numbers for COVID-19 that were much lower than they are now.He says the province should exercise caution and continue with remote learning until case numbers are more manageable as has been done in New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador.
Education Minister Becky Druhan told reporters following a cabinet meeting Thursday that plans are in place to respond to whatever operational challenges arise.
Druhan says that includes assigning administrative staff from school districts to the classroom in the event of teacher shortages due to illness or the need to self-isolate.
1 p.m.: Nova Scotia is reporting 68 people are now in hospital due to COVID-19 and are receiving specialized care in a designated unit.
That number is up from the 58 admissions reported Saturday, while the number of patients in intensive care remains the same at 10.
There is no word today on the number of people who have been discharged from hospital after being sick with an infection.
Officials say two other groups are also in hospital with infections; 60 people who were identified as positive upon arrival but who were admitted for another medical reason and 112 who contracted the virus after being admitted.
The province also reported 696 new confirmed COVID-19 cases today — an increase of 69 from the 627 reported on Saturday.
Officials say 447 cases have been identified in the Halifax area, 108 in the province’s eastern zone, 105 in the western zone and 36 in the northern zone.
1 p.m.: Parents and teachers in four provinces are preparing for students to return to the classroom on Monday as the Omicron variant-fuelled wave of COVID-19 continues to spread.
Kids in Ontario and Quebec, Canada’s largest provinces, will resume in-person learning after their governments delayed their return in the face of record-setting case numbers over the holidays.
Ontario today reported 3,595 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, with 579 in intensive care.
The latest figures represent a drop from the day before, but Health Minister Christine Elliott tweeted not all hospitals report their COVID-19 numbers over the weekend.
Quebec, meanwhile, says hospitalizations rose by 105 over the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of patients to 3,300.
Manitoba and Nova Scotia will also send kids back to the classroom on Monday, with Nova Scotia being the only province in the Atlantic region to be doing so.
While public health experts, parents and officials agree that in-school learning is best for children, school boards, families and unions say they’re bracing for an increase in staff absences because of the virus.
Ontario and Nova Scotia also plan to supply students with rapid antigen tests as one of the safety precautions to keep schools open.
11:45 a.m.: Quebec is reporting yet another jump in COVID-19-related hospitalizations today, saying the figure climbed by 105 in the past 24 hours and now stands at 3,300.
The provincial health department says 282 patients are currently in intensive care, an increase of seven from the previous day.
The province is also reporting 5,946 new cases of COVID-19, with 21 more deaths related to the virus.
Authorities say 81,564 doses of COVID-19 vaccine were administered in the past 24 hours, including 71,724 third doses.
It also says 13.1 per cent of the 39,806 COVID-19 tests processed in the last 24 hours came back positive.
In-person learning is set to resume Monday for Quebec’s elementary and high school students even as COVID-19 infections continue to surge across the province.
11:32 a.m.: The federal government’s COVID-19 testing requirements for travellers entering the country are a “drain” on capacity so overwhelmed by the Omicron surge that officials can only guess the true number of daily infections, Canada’s top public health officer says.
While Dr. Theresa Tam stopped short of calling for the requirements to be dropped, she said she believes it is time to stop “sequencing” COVID-19 samples from travellers arriving from abroad at Canadian airports, given the global prevalence of the highly contagious Omicron variant.
That means specialists Ottawa contracted to conduct the tests would no longer perform a procedure to determine whether each detected case is Omicron or another form of the virus.
Read the full story from the Star’s Alex Ballingall.
11:30 a.m.: Most Ontario long-term care workers have just under two weeks to get their third COVID-19 vaccine doses, but union and industry groups say more time is needed to meet the government’s target as staff infections reach record levelsand workers struggle to access appointments.
The government has mandated booster doses for workers in the sector, citing the heightened risk to vulnerable residents living in the homes that saw thousands of deaths and outbreaks earlier in the pandemic.
Workers, volunteers and students have until Jan. 28 to get their third shots and stay on the job, if enough time has passed since their second dose. People who became eligible for boosters after Jan. 1 have until March 14 to get third shots, and those with recent COVID-19 infections will also have more time to get their jabs.
The Long-Term Care Ministry says the majority of staff are currently eligible for third doses. As of Jan. 12, close to 64 per cent of those people had already gotten third shots, a spokesman said Friday, adding that “the expectation remains that eligible staff receive a third dose by Jan. 28.”
But with the Omicron variant driving outbreaks, worker absences and staff infections to record-breaking numbers, those on the inside say the target – though important to protecting residents – will be nearly impossible to reach sector-wide in time.
10:15 a.m. (updated): Ontario is reporting 3,595 patients are currently hospitalized with COVID-19, including 579 in intensive care units.
The new figures represent a decrease from the 3,957 patients in hospital on Saturday, but Health Minister Christine Elliott notes not all hospitals report their numbers on weekends.
The province is also reporting 40 new virus-related deaths today.
The number of people on ventilators due to COVID-19 surged to 340 from 319 the day before.
The province is reporting 10,450 new COVID-19 cases, though Public Health Ontario has noted that the total number is likely higher due to testing policy changes that limit access for many residents.
Provincial data shows 91.4 per cent of Ontarians aged 12 and older have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and 88.7 per cent have two doses.
9 a.m.: The World Health Organization said Sunday that a UN-backed program shipping coronavirus vaccines to many poor countries has now delivered 1 billion doses, but that milestone “is only a reminder of the work that remains” after hoarding and stockpiling in rich countries.
A shipment of 1.1 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to Rwanda on Saturday included the billionth dose supplied via the COVAX program, the U.N. health agency said.
WHO has long criticized unequal distribution of vaccines and called for manufacturers and other countries to prioritize COVAX. It said that, as of Thursday, 36 of its 194 member countries had vaccinated less than 10% of their population and 88 had vaccinated less than 40%.
The program has made deliveries to 144 countries so far, “but the work that has gone into this milestone is only a reminder of the work that remains,” WHO said in a statement.
“COVAX’s ambition was compromised by hoarding/stockpiling in rich countries, catastrophic outbreaks leading to borders and supply being locked,” it added. “And a lack of sharing of licenses, technology and know-how by pharmaceutical companies meant manufacturing capacity went unused.”
At the end of December, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged everyone to make a “new year’s resolution” to get behind a campaign to vaccinate 70% of countries’ populations by the beginning of July.
In a newspaper interview published Sunday, Germany’s new international development minister said she wants to use her country’s presidency this year of the Group of Seven industrial nations to ensure that COVAX gets the resources it needs in 2022.
“Unfortunately, there are still too few countries participating in the financing of the global vaccination campaign,” Svenja Schulze was quoted as telling the Funke newspaper group. “Alongside Sweden, Norway, Canada and the U.S., we are the ones who are giving most. The other industrial countries have significant ground to catch up.”
9 a.m.: COVID-19 infections are soaring again at U.S. nursing homes because of the omicron wave, and deaths are climbing too, leading to new restrictions on family visits and a renewed push to get more residents and staff members vaccinated and boosted.
Nursing homes were the lethal epicentre of the pandemic early on, before the vaccine allowed many of them to reopen to visitors last year. But the wildly contagious variant has dealt them a setback.
Nursing homes reported a near-record of about 32,000 COVID-19 cases among residents in the week ending Jan. 9, an almost sevenfold increase from a month earlier, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
A total of 645 COVID-19-related deaths among residents were recorded during the same week, a 47% increase from the earlier period. And there are fears that deaths could go much higher before omicron is through.
Despite the rising numbers, the situation is not as dire as it was in December 2020, when nursing home deaths per week topped out at about 6,200. Experts credit the high vaccination rates now among nursing home residents: About 87% are fully vaccinated, according to CDC data.
9 a.m.: Dr. Kieran Quinn says he’s noticed a shift in attitude among his friends, colleagues and community members during the Omicron wave of COVID-19, as preventive vigilance has eroded into resignation that infection seems inevitable.
The clinician-scientist at Toronto’s Mount Sinai Hospital says he can sympathize with this sense of pandemic fatigue as the Omicron variant rages across Canada, ushering in another round of public health restrictions and backlogged demand for tests and COVID-19 vaccines.
As Omicron gains a reputation as a “mild” virus variant, Quinn says he sees why some people might feel tempted to “let it rip” in hopes of moving on from the pandemic’s latest and in some cases most overwhelming wave.
But Quinn and other doctors say Canadians can’t afford to be so cavalier about Omicron, because while the risks of infection seem lower to some individuals, abetting the variant’s supercharged spread would have devastating consequences across society.
“We need to look beyond ourselves and protect those around us who are most vulnerable,” said Quinn. “Omicron is not going to spare those people if we throw caution to the wind and ‘let it rip.’”
Emerging evidence suggests Omicron is less likely to cause severe illness than previous COVID-19 strains, but Quinn said those relative differences still translate into absolute numbers that make the new variant’s impact on the health system anything but mild.
Britain’s public health agency released preliminary data last month that found people with the Omicron variant were between 50 to 70 per cent less likely to require hospitalization than those with the Delta strain.
But research also indicates that Omicron is several times more transmissible than its predecessors, Quinn said, adding that even if a smaller proportion of infected people need medical attention, the sheer volume of cases would overwhelm hospitals.
9 a.m.: Aussie rules. And Novak Djokovic is out.
Kicked to the curb at the Australian Open, steered towards a plane for deportation, driven into infamy as the world’s most famous anti-vaxxer. Not a boastful distinction, even though Djokovic has been exalted to martyr loftiness among the disbelievers.
Shortly before 2 a.m., Toronto time, Chief Justice James Allsop announced the unanimous decision of full court hearing, dismissing Djokovic’s appeal of his deportation order. It had taken the three judges some four hours of deliberation on the matter.
Go. Leave. Begone. And pay the government’s court costs as you exit — a further humiliation for the intractable vaccine loather.
Djokovic’s visa was irreversibly cancelled. He was obligated to depart the country before the Open gets underway Monday. He also faces a three-year ban from returning, except in certain circumstances, that can include “compelling circumstances that affect the interests of Australia’’. Presumably that could mean the Australian Open in 2023, 2024 and 2025.
Read the full column from the Star’s Rosie DiManno.
9 a.m.: State media are reporting the Chinese city of Xi’an has gradually begun lifting restrictions after over three weeks of lockdown as authorities sought to stamp out a local outbreak.
State-owned broadcaster CCTV reported Sunday that certain counties and development zones in Xi’an had begun restoring production, citing a news conference by Xi’an officials.
They also said that lockdown measures had been either partially or completely lifted in some communities that have been designated as lower risk, allowing people to leave their homes for a limited time to purchase daily necessities.
The partial lifting of measures comes after the city went into strict lockdown on Dec. 22, following a local coronavirus outbreak that officials attributed to the delta variant. The city has reported over 2,000 infections since December last year.
China is seeking to stamp out local transmission of the omicron and delta variants with its “zero COVID” policy. Several municipalities and cities in the southern province of Guangdong as well as Beijing have in recent days reported local cases of the more contagious omicron variant.
9 a.m.: Health Canada’s chief medical adviser says variant-specific vaccines can be approved faster than the general ones first issued to combat COVID-19, but one targeting the Omicron strain still likely won’t be ready in time to help with the latest wave.
Dr. Supriya Sharma said what is really needed are vaccines that can possibly stop more than one variant at a time, including those yet to come.
Omicron became the dominant variant in Canada in just over two weeks, and the Public Health Agency of Canada said Friday it’s now believed to be responsible for more than 90 per cent of all COVID-19 cases.
Studies suggest two doses of the existing mRNA vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are not good at preventing infection from Omicron.
Multiple studies, however, suggest the vaccines are excellent at keeping symptoms mild, preventing hospitalizations, and shortening the stay and lowering the level of care for those who do get admitted to hospital. Fewer vaccinated Omicron patients, for example, need mechanical ventilation.
Both Pfizer and Moderna are working on new versions of their vaccines that specifically target the Omicron variant.

Full text: Alexa McDonough might have been amused to see the spirited debate that erupted on social media after news of her death was announced over the weekend.
It all revolved around which trails McDonough blazed for women in positions of political leadership in Canada - could the former leader of the NDP really be described as a "first" in that league?
That may be beside the point. McDonough's main achievement, at least at the national level, could well lie in her 1995 victory as the second woman to be elected to lead a federal political party. In what was definitely a break from the past and still-current tradition, the New Democrats replaced one woman leader - Audrey McLaughlin - with another one, McDonough.
Incredibly, that remains a rare accomplishment in politics at many levels. "We tried that once" continues to be a real thing with female political leadership, even now, about three decades since two of Canada's major national parties experimented with women in charge.
Kim Campbell is still the one and only woman who was elected to the leadership of the federal Conservatives; the federal Liberals have yet to choose a woman leader. In the United States, Hillary Clinton's experience appeared to scare the Democrats away from another woman at the helm for the 2020 contest and perhaps well into the future, too.
In short, in the 21st century, the challenge for women isn't getting the big jobs - it's keeping them there.
This phenomenon is probably at the front of my mind right now because I recently read a review copy of Kate Graham's new book, "No Second Chances," which explores a bizarre reality in Canada.
Here it is: Only 13 women have led governments in this country, and not one was re-elected. That's correct. Not one.
"There are concerning similarities in their stories," the book jacket states. "Women tend to reach the top only in challenging political circumstances; they last in the top job for about half as long as men do; and, when they run for re-election, they lose."
Graham's book, due out this spring, is based on a podcast she hosted, featuring interviews with all 13 - from Campbell to B.C.'s Christy Clark to Kathleen Wynne in Ontario. Graham is a former provincial candidate herself, who ran unsuccessfully in London, Ont., during the 2018 election, when Wynne was trying to get re-elected, and later ran to succeed her as Liberal leader.
I remember being at the 1995 leadership convention in Ottawa when McDonough was chosen and I recall my own surprise that the NDP would replace one woman with another one. This was just a couple of years after the 1993 federal election that featured two women leaders: McLaughlin and Campbell.
Both parties led by women failed to win even official party status in the Commons - the mighty Conservatives were reduced to just two seats, and the New Democrats won nine. Coincidence? Maybe, but there was lots of talk back then about whether either party would have fared better under male leaders.
Many women have been coming forward since McDonough's passing over the weekend to talk about the ways in which she encouraged others to see politics as a world that was open to them.
The best story, though, may have come from Megan Leslie, the former NDP MP from Halifax, who spoke on CBC's "Sunday Magazine" about how she went to McDonough for advice after a colleague made a casually sexist remark.
McDonough told her to "suck it up" - that this was normal in the rough and tumble world of politics. Many of us who were around in the 1980s and 1990s remember getting that kind of advice, and possibly even dispensing it, too. That's what happens after you break into a world as an outsider: you learn the rules, stay quiet and wait for critical mass of others to make things better.
Leslie spoke of how McDonough came to her much later, after leaving Ottawa, to say she regretted that counsel. Progress for women in politics, McDonough realized, depends not in being a novelty, but about changing ideas - even your own ideas - about how the system works.
I like to think McDonough would be most proud not just of when she came first, but what she represented in terms of succession for women leaders. The goalposts have shifted since all those "firsts" of the 20th century, from getting women into the top jobs, to getting used to them being there.
McDonough helped the NDP crack that "tried it once" barrier, showing that it is possible for women in top jobs to be more than a temporary novelty. In a country that still isn't that great at giving women second chances in the top spots, that's a legacy achievement on its own.

Ford's competence card deals himself out

Full text: With future leadership challenger Rod Phillips suddenly quitting cabinet, Doug Ford is no longer looking over his shoulder.
But the premier has just lost the eyes in the back of his head. Phillips was the minister of competence who could see around corners in a government that goes by its gut.
Now, with the June 2 election looming, Ford is alone at the wheel - just as he was during Monday's snowstorm. Those televised images of the premier in the driver's seat doing FaceTime interviews in between digging out snowbound motorists in Etobicoke spoke volumes.
Whenever Ford's Tories dug themselves into a hole, they relied on Phillips to help them stop digging and find a way out of the storm. This week with Phillips gone, Ford was back digging himself in deeper for all to see.
Ford long ago invited voters to just ring his cellphone if they had a problem, until his staff talked him out of treating the premier's office like a call centre. Now it's back to help lines and towing lines.
On the campaign trail ahead, the premier will be flying by the seat of his pants without Phillips looking out for him - and telling him where to turn next. The story of how this patrician partisan came to be at the premier's side, and then fell by the wayside, could tell the tale of Ford's future.
By quitting now, on the eve of an election and in the midst of a pandemic, Phillips is depriving the Progressive Conservatives of the competence card when the government needs it most. And the province depends on it more than ever.
Why did Phillips want to leave now? Why did Ford let him go?
Four years ago, when his first provincial election campaign was faltering as his populist schtick fell flat, Ford turned to Phillips for help. At a campaign event in Newmarket, the party pointedly showcased the brains behind the aspiring premier.
Phillips was front and centre, reassuring voters that the party was qualified to govern. But the premier came to rely ever more heavily on Phillips lending a steady hand for shaky assignments.
His background as a former political aide, successful entrepreneur, public servant, media executive, and philanthropic leader - and an old school Red Tory - made him a good fit for the realities of governing after the fantasies of Ford's populist crusade. But Phillips, too, had his blind spots.
He climbed the greasy flagpole of government, then tumbled down, then clambered back up again, and is now jumping off. His rise and fall and recovery spans the ups and downs of this government.
First, at the environment portfolio, the rookie minister had to somehow make sense of Ford's nonsensical promise to eliminate a "carbon tax" that didn't exist in Ontario. Phillips was made to cancel the province's more efficient "cap and trade" regime - which triggered, by default, a federal carbon tax that endures to this day.
He survived that assignment by mastering the minutiae of carbon targets while studiously ignoring the big picture realities. But it was political art, not environmental science - and not his finest hour.
A grateful Ford rewarded Phillips for his loyalty by elevating him to finance minister to stabilize his government after its first bungled budget. His competence was exceeded only by his overconfidence when Phillips made the fateful mistake of slipping away to the Caribbean for a Christmas getaway in late 2020, leaving behind pretaped video greetings from his office.
In exile, Phillips licked his wounds and awaited rehabilitation. When the call came to return to cabinet, he was handed the hardest assignment that no one else wanted - long-term care.
Phillips proved a quick study, moving rapidly on the problems that could be fixed fast. He persuaded his fellow ministers to mandate vaccines for long-term-care workers who had long resisted them, and found the funds for more beds.
Why bail out now? Is Phillips abandoning a sinking ship?
More likely he has calculated that Ford is on track to be re-elected on June 2 and not going anywhere after that. That would leave Phillips doing more of the same - looking out for a premier who likes to be in the driver's seat in a snowstorm.
That's not what Phillips signed up for when he was recruited by previous PC leader Patrick Brown to cobble together a Red Tory platform, which Ford promptly ripped up. In truth, he has always nursed ambitions to one day inherit the helm, briefly flirting with a leadership run in early 2018 until he was quickly overshadowed by the high-profile Ford.
Unlike the premier, whose first allegiance has always been to his imagined Ford Nation ahead of his provincial PCs, Phillips has always styled himself a party loyalist - and, yes, future leader. Friday's resignation statement noted pointedly that he'd called the PC Party president and not just notified the premier.
Why didn't a forward-looking Ford try to talk him out of it? Perhaps he was still looking over his shoulder.
After his downfall a year ago, Phillips was damaged goods politically - many of his erstwhile allies stopped reaching out. He had gone from political anonymity to notoriety in one news cycle.
I wrote then that his dream of becoming premier had faded forever. But I'm almost always wrong.
At 56, Phillips is now telling us he's gone for good. Note that he never said "Never."

COVID infections hit peak among LTC staff: Resident deaths rising sharply in January

Full text: Paul Calandra takes over as Ontario's fourth long-term-care minister in four years as the Omicron variant puts nursing homes under the spotlight again with a provincial election just months away.
There were no resident deaths reported from COVID-19 in November and 10 in December as experts warned of the Omicron risk. The toll has risen sharply to 61 this month in a sector that accounts for about 4,000 pandemic fatalities.
Despite mandatory vaccination policies and a fourth dose effort, hundreds of residents and staff are catching the highly contagious strain following a lull in the fall when there were fewer cases.
"Once again, we are hearing from residents, their families and front-line staff of mass staff shortages, and residents confined to rooms for days, even weeks, at a time," New Democratic Leader Andrea Horwath wrote Monday in a letter to Premier Doug Ford.
Almost 4,100 nurses, personal support workers and other staff are themselves fighting active cases of COVID - the highest number since the start of the pandemic - raising concerns care will decline.
"I don't know what is replacing that care," said caregiver advocate Vivian Stamatopoulos, a university professor who liaises with families. Stamatopoulos warned that staffing shortages increase the risks of medication errors, untreated illnesses and isolation in residents.
Calandra (Markham-Stouffville), a small businessperson and insurance broker before entering politics, was appointed Friday after his predecessor, Rod Phillips, unexpectedly announced he will be retiring from politics.
"Minister Calandra continues to be briefed and updated by officials about the current situation in long-term care," spokesperson Vanessa De Matteis said Monday.
There are about 2,600 residents with active cases and just over half of Ontario's 626 nursing homes have outbreaks, although 73 of them had no resident cases.
The portfolio is in addition to Calandra's roles as minister of legislative affairs and government house leader, steering Ford's agenda through the legislature.
Donna Duncan of the Ontario Long-Term Care Association, which represents 70 per cent of nursing homes, said staffing levels remain her biggest concern at a time when hospitals are also experiencing staff shortages and can't help out as they did in the second wave of COVID.
That situation has prompted nursing homes to ask local doctor's offices and family health teams for help with vaccinations and to local restaurants and community college culinary programs for help with meals if they have lost kitchen staff to the virus. "They've reached out to family members (of residents) to hire them to assist," Duncan added. "These are temporary emergency measures."
Duncan said help from the province has improved dramatically from the deadly first wave of COVID, when some homes saw staff levels fall as low as 20 per cent from absenteeism and illness, prompting Ford to call for help from military medical teams. Those teams found horrific conditions such as residents malnourished, dehydrated, left in dirty diapers for long periods crying for help, and given expired medications.
Horwath and Green Leader Mike Schreiner urged Ford to take away Calandra's other responsibilities so he can focus on nursing homes.
"We need a minister who is solely focused on long-term care because we are in a crisis," Schreiner told a news conference.

Full text: In a major pre-election setback for Premier Doug Ford's Progressive Conservatives, Long-Term Care Minister Rod Phillips is retiring from politics.
Phillips, a key cabinet minister who has represented Ajax since 2018, announced Friday he would not be running in the June 2 election.
"I have spoken with Premier Ford and with Brian Patterson, president of the Ontario PC Party, to inform them of my decision not to seek re-election and to step down next month as the MPP for Ajax," Phillips, 56, said in a written statement.
"This will allow the premier to appoint a successor to continue the important work of the Ministry of Long-Term Care. It also ensures that the PC Party has the time needed to nominate a candidate in Ajax and prepare for the provincial election," he said.
"I have always considered public service a privilege and it has been an honour to serve as the MPP for Ajax and in three cabinet portfolios. That said, my professional life has been spent in the business world and I look forward to returning to the private sector."
His surprise departure is a political blow to Ford, coming just 20 weeks before what public opinion polls suggest could be a close election.
On Twitter, the premier thanked Phillips "for his tireless work representing the people of Ajax and advancing important and necessary improvements in Ontario's long-term care system."
"I want to wish him and Lydia the very best in their next chapter. I have no doubt there are great things for Rod ahead," said Ford, who on Friday night appointed Paul Calandra, minister of legislative affairs and government house leader, to also be long-term care minister.
For his part, Phillips praised the premier's "strong leadership ... through what is undoubtedly the greatest challenge of our lifetimes, the global COVID-19 pandemic.
Since taking over the embattled Ministry of Long-Term Care last June, Phillips has been credited for helping to improve Ontario's pandemic-ravaged nursing homes, which suffered greatly in the first waves of COVID-19. But about half of all nursing homes are currently battling outbreaks as the highly contagious Omicron variant spreads.
Along with joining ministry inspectors on surprise spot-checks of homes, he implemented a mandatory vaccination policy for all staff and ensured hefty increases to operating budgets and infrastructure investments in an area long neglected by successive governments of all political stripes.
"Our work together has been the most meaningful in my time as a minister of the Crown," Phillips said of the long-term care sector.
"Together we have protected residents with the toughest legislation and best enforcement in the country, moved ahead with the largest long-term-care building program ever in Canada and invested in training and hiring tens of thousands of new, front-line health-care staff. All while continuing to do everything possible to vaccinate and protect residents and staff through this latest wave of the global pandemic."
But NDP MPP Sara Singh (Brampton Centre) said Phillips's resignation suggests Ford's government is in disarray.
"Outbreaks and staff shortages are surging in long-term-care homes again, leaving residents at risk. This is not the first time the government has changed long-term-care ministers when residents were in the middle of a crisis," said Singh, referring to former minister Merrilee Fullerton.
Liberal Steven Del Duca said the "abrupt departure ... while more than half of Ontario's nursing homes have COVID outbreaks is a total abdication of leadership and a sign of pure chaos in Ford's Conservative party."
"Doug Ford's incompetence has turned a health crisis into a crisis of leadership," said Del Duca, who also thanked the minister "for his years of public service."
Phillips made headlines in December 2020 when he went on vacation to the Caribbean island of St. Barts at a time when the federal government was urging Canadians to avoid non-essential travel.
Even though the premier's office was aware of the Christmas trip, he resigned as finance minister upon his return to spare Ford further political embarrassment.
But his absence from the executive council coincided with some of the Tories' most chaotic months of the pandemic, culminating in a marathon two-day cabinet meeting last April when ministers decided to impose police spot checks and close playgrounds to curb the spread of COVID-19.
Those controversial moves were abandoned the next day amid a massive outcry from Ontarians and directly contributed to a displeased Ford shuffling his cabinet weeks later and handing Phillips the challenging long-term-care file.
A successful business leader before entering elected politics, Phillips served as chair of Postmedia, parent company of the National Post and the Toronto Sun, and in 2011 was appointed president and CEO of Ontario Lottery and Gaming by Liberal premier Dalton McGuinty.
In 2014, he succeeded Toronto Mayor John Tory as chair of the non-partisan CivicAction urban affairs organization. He also served as mayor Mel Lastman's chief of staff after the 1998 amalgamation of the old city of Toronto with North York, Etobicoke, Scarborough, York and East York.
Long mentioned as a potential successor to Ford as Progressive Conservative leader, Phillips's retirement jolts the political landscape as ministers begin jockeying for positioning in a future leadership contest.

Interim Green leader says last leadership vote not 'legitimate'

Full text: The new interim leader of the Green Party of Canada has something they want to say.
"I don't actually think that the last vote was legitimate," Amita Kuttner tells me over coffee, regarding the leadership contest that was won by the now-departed Annamie Paul.
"Enough people didn't get their ballots."
In the fall of 2020, Paul won the leadership in the eighth round of balloting with 50.63 per cent of the votes cast - and 2,009 more than her closest opponent, eco-socialist Dimitri Lascaris.
Days before the vote, I heard of complaints. On a podcast I hosted, leadership contestant Meryam Haddad described the Greens' race as plagued with so many problems that, she said, whether they were "intended or not," she would "doubt how democratically the next leader" was chosen. At the time, the party refused to say how many complaints it received about missing ballots. Last week, it similarly declined to offer specifics.
It's clearly too late for what ifs. Paul's yearlong leadership was marked by infighting, the defection of a Green MP to the Liberals, and legal action between the leader and the party that strained its finances. In July alone, according to a November report to members, more than $100,000 was spent on legal fees and arbitration costs.
That report said the Green Party of Canada is on the verge of bankruptcy and that "the threat of insolvency ... continues to this day." The party can't even find an insurer willing to provide its directors and officers with liability insurance, leaving them personally responsible for unpaid wages and taxes if the organization becomes insolvent.
Fundraising stalled as Paul, the first Black and Jewish woman to lead a major federal party, waged battle with the party's federal council, painting efforts to oust her as fuelled by racism and sexism. For most months in 2021, the party's expenses exceeded its revenues. It lost nearly a third of its monthly donors last year and a fifth of its members.
In September, as the party announced a leadership review, Paul announced her intention to resign. She had led the party to its worst electoral result in 20 years, capturing only 2.3 per cent of the popular vote, or 396,988 votes cast. (In 2019, the Greens won nearly 1.2-million votes.)
In November, Paul officially resigned and Kuttner, a bilingual 30-year-old (now 31) British Columbian with a PhD in astrophysics, was chosen by the party's federal council as its interim leader. Although a past leadership candidate and a candidate in the 2019 election, Kuttner's nomination made international news for another reason: they are the first trans person to lead a national party in Canada. (Also, the youngest, and first non-binary and East Asian person, according to the party.)
At their first news conference, Kuttner's voice cracked. "I know I sound like a teenager," they told reporters. "But ... that's because I'm going through a bit of a transition." Their transition is a topic Kuttner discusses openly and unprompted. They're taking testosterone to lower their voice, and finally feeling comfortable in their shirts, they say, after top surgery. "I'm sure every trans person has a different experience ... but for me ... I didn't inhabit my body at all. I didn't realize this until [2020]," Kuttner explains, picking at their cauliflower pakora. "And the second that I did, it was like this sudden, overwhelming feeling of dysphoria, like terror, of being stuck in that body."
But, at that news conference, Kuttner shares, there was a moment where they suddenly felt aware of their chest and "able to embody" themselves.
"But I couldn't think about it too hard because I was like in the middle of an answer," they say, with a broad contagious smile.
Kuttner was told several times during the 2020 leadership race that the country wasn't ready for a trans leader, but it's not what they say they experienced.
Their hope is to spark understanding by sharing their experience. "Isn't that the point? That we understand each other so we can live with each other, so we get along?"
While Kuttner's transition continues, their first task has been to focus on rebuilding and listening. To that end, the party sent out a post-election survey on Friday, hoping to better understand and engage its members.
Kuttner also plans to recommend structural changes to the party's organization. The Greens currently operate in a decentralized fashion, where the leader operates not as a CEO but as one voice among many around the council table.
"I don't think that disempowering everybody in a leadership role is going to ever lend to stability and being able to function in a way that gets [us] seats," Kuttner explains. "We are a political party, at the end of the day."
That struggle is seen as key to many of the problems that plagued Paul's leadership. But Kuttner thinks there's a way to do it while still embracing the Greens' commitment to grassroots and democracy.
Another focus will be fundraising, which Kuttner proudly states has turned around since their appointment.
Donors do seem to have opened their wallets since Paul announced her resignation. More money came in following the 2021 election than in 2019, and the party raised more than twice as much cash in December 2021 as it did in December 2019.
The party made painful decisions last year to cut costs. It went through a first round of layoffs in July, then hired staff back for the election, only to lay off 11 people again in October. Grievances are expected.
The party also ended contracts and renegotiated its office lease. Despite the board saying it is considering "possible termination of the Ottawa office lease in 2022," Kuttner insists the Greens will maintain a physical presence in the capital. "There is no question of getting rid of it entirely," they said. "We can just have a smaller office or something."
Kuttner's major agenda item, though, is to help ensure a good and clean leadership contest, free of ballot problems and - they hope - with fewer divisions.
Last time, Kuttner says some members didn't receive ballots "until after the contest had closed," and others whose contact information was a phone number were never contacted to make sure they received a ballot.
"I don't know the numbers," they add, "but they are significant."
Initially, Kuttner says they were not convinced that the voting errors would have changed the outcome of the race. " I didn't feel like I wanted to rub it in, to create any more issues here over questioning anyone's right to be leader.
"But the truth is, I really don't think the outcome [was fair], since there were so many problems with it."
The Greens' leadership race must start within six months of the interim leader's appointment - by May 24 - and last a maximum of 24 months. Kuttner hopes it's short, focused and doesn't lead to too many rounds of voting, so the party can come together more easily afterwards.
Few of the 2020 entrants plan on running again, but Lascaris told me he's still considering it. Kuttner won't. They are still soured by their experience in the 2019 federal election, running against NDP star candidate Svend Robinson, whom Kuttner says bullied them. "Whether he intended it or not, he was abusive."
Robinson denies the allegations and told Kuttner they should apologize to him.
If the government falls before summer, Kuttner has said they'll run as a candidate but otherwise, they're unsure.
"I don't feel like I can go into a partisan fight on a personal level while I'm this [physically] vulnerable," they said.
Instead, Kuttner is relishing leading in this interim role.
"I believe in the importance of the party as an effective tool, and I want to help them mobilize to get to that point."

Vax tax easier to promise than to collect

Full text: In his three years as Quebec's premier, François Legault has never shied away from controversial initiatives.
To wit: Bill 21, the law that imposes a secular dress code on some of the province's public servants; a bid to unilaterally enshrine the concept of the Quebec nation in the Constitution; and a liberal use of the notwithstanding clause to circumvent the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
In each case, Legault has stared down opposition critics and been rewarded for his government's efforts with a stellar performance in the polls on voting intentions.
Given that, it is little wonder that the premier felt emboldened this week to go where no other provincial government leader had dared to tread by declaring his intention to impose a tax on those who continue to resist calls to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
For that, Legault reaped some immediate political dividends.
The announcement came on a day when the premier would otherwise have had to account for the resignation of the province's chief medical officer. Attention instantly shifted away from his government's hit-and-miss management of the ongoing Omicron-driven phase of the pandemic.
It offered a bone of sorts to the many vaccinated Quebecers, who have grown impatient with the unvaccinated minority. And the prospect of taking a hit in their pocketbooks almost certainly brought some vaccine-reluctant people to belatedly line up for a first dose.
But while talk of a health tax paid off, walking that talk could come at a price to the CAQ over the next pre-election months.
Since the start of the pandemic, it had seemed that Legault could do no wrong. Each of the restrictions his government put in place over the first waves of COVID-19 shored up its popularity.
The advent of the Omicron variant has upended that winning equation.
The decision last month to reinstate a curfew landed with a thud in public opinion. (It will be lifted as of Monday.) Questions about the rationale of the restrictions have become more pointed.
A Mainstreet poll published this week - before the proposed health tax was squarely in the picture - found that the latest round of restrictions has, for the first time since the pandemic began, taken a toll on CAQ support.
Some of that support has leaked to the province's fledgling Conservative party. When it comes to lockdowns and vaccine mandates, the latter is closer to Maxime Bernier's People's Party than to the federal Conservatives.
The securalism law and the language bill are most strongly opposed by members of constituencies that do not support the CAQ. By contrast, a number of the party's supporters are in the sights of Legault's health contribution. On the October provincial ballot, the provincial Conservative party could offer them a place from which to vent their anger at the government.
Legault may have hoped that pulling the rabbit of a health tax out of his hat would work magic on the public mood. Early indications suggest the announcement failed to do the trick.
Editorial reactions essentially ranged from skepticism as to the merits or the feasibility of such a measure to downright opposition to its punitive spirit.
In the National Assembly, none of the opposition parties offered support.
At the federal level, the Bloc Québécois reserved comment on the substance of the announcement, stating that it was not its place to wade into a debate over made-in-Quebec policy.
Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole set aside his calls for provincial autonomy long enough to come out against Legault's plan, in no small part to avoid further public caucus divisions.
In other provincial capitals, premiers such as Ontario's Doug Ford were prompt to shut down the notion that their governments might follow suit.
On Thursday, Legault said he planned to introduce a bill to implement the measure when the National Assembly reconvenes next month. It will be greeted by a barrage of opposition criticism.
Between now and then, he will have to reconcile his stated goal of growing the ranks of the vaccinated and diminishing the burden the unvaccinated put on the health-care system with the feasibility of collecting a tax anytime soon.
He has ruled out exacting a user's fee for medical services from the unvaccinated. That would be a direct breach of the Canada Health Act.
Unless Legault plans to have the police comb the province's health records, the better to hunt down the unvaccinated, that leaves the income tax route. It is hard to see how a change along the lines the premier has in mind could come into effect for this tax season.
But a measure that hits pocketbooks only in 18 to 20 months is unlikely to act as much of an incentive to get vaccinated or to offer relief to the health-care system.
No one will be surprised if Legault ends up puncturing the trial balloon of a health tax on the unvaccinated before it becomes clear that it is too poorly designed to fly.

In the fall of 2020, Paul won the leadership in the eighth round of balloting with 50.63 per cent of the votes cast — and 2,009 more than her closest opponent, eco-socialist Dimitri Lascaris.
Days before the vote, I heard of complaints. On a podcast I hosted , leadership contestant Meryam Haddad described the Greens’ race as plagued with so many problems that, she said , whether they were “intended or not,” she would “doubt how democratically the next leader” was chosen. At the time, the party refused to say how many complaints it received about missing ballots. Last week, it similarly declined to offer specifics.
It’s clearly too late for what ifs. Paul’s yearlong leadership was marked by infighting, the defection of a Green MP to the Liberals, and legal action between the leader and the party that strained its finances. In July alone, according to a November report to members, more than $100,000 was spent on legal fees and arbitration costs.
That report said the Green Party of Canada is on the verge of bankruptcy and that “the threat of insolvency ... continues to this day.” The party can’t even find an insurer willing to provide its directors and officers with liability insurance, leaving them personally responsible for unpaid wages and taxes if the organization becomes insolvent.
Fundraising stalled as Paul, the first Black and Jewish woman to lead a major federal party, waged battle with the party’s federal council, painting efforts to oust her as fuelled by racism and sexism. For most months in 2021, the party’s expenses exceeded its revenues. It lost nearly a third of its monthly donors last year and a fifth of its members.
In September, as the party announced a leadership review, Paul announced her intention to resign. She had led the party to its worst electoral result in 20 years, capturing only 2.3 per cent of the popular vote, or 396,988 votes cast. (In 2019, the Greens won nearly 1.2-million votes.)
In November, Paul officially resigned and Kuttner, a bilingual 30-year-old (now 31) British Columbian with a PhD in astrophysics, was chosen by the party’s federal council as its interim leader. Although a past leadership candidate and a candidate in the 2019 election, Kuttner’s nomination made international news for another reason: they are the first trans person to lead a national party in Canada. (Also, the youngest, and first non-binary and East Asian person, according to the party.)
At their first news conference, Kuttner’s voice cracked. “I know I sound like a teenager,” they told reporters. “But … that’s because I’m going through a bit of a transition.” Their transition is a topic Kuttner discusses openly and unprompted. They’re taking testosterone to lower their voice, and finally feeling comfortable in their shirts, they say, after top surgery.
“I’m sure every trans person has a different experience … but for me … I didn’t inhabit my body at all. I didn’t realize this until [2020],” Kuttner explains, picking at their cauliflower pakora. “And the second that I did, it was like this sudden, overwhelming feeling of dysphoria, like terror, of being stuck in that body.”
But, at that news conference, Kuttner shares, there was a moment where they suddenly felt aware of their chest and “able to embody” themselves.
“But I couldn’t think about it too hard because I was like in the middle of an answer,” they say, with a broad contagious smile.
Kuttner was told several times during the 2020 leadership race that the country wasn’t ready for a trans leader, but it’s not what they say they experienced.
Their hope is to spark understanding by sharing their experience. “Isn’t that the point? That we understand each other so we can live with each other, so we get along?”
While Kuttner’s transition continues, their first task has been to focus on rebuilding and listening. To that end, the party sent out a post-election survey on Friday, hoping to better understand and engage its members.
Kuttner also plans to recommend structural changes to the party’s organization. The Greens currently operate in a decentralized fashion, where the leader operates not as a CEO but as one voice among many around the council table.
“I don’t think that disempowering everybody in a leadership role is going to ever lend to stability and being able to function in a way that gets [us] seats,” Kuttner explains. “We are a political party, at the end of the day.”
That struggle is seen as key to many of the problems that plagued Paul’s leadership. But Kuttner thinks there’s a way to do it while still embracing the Greens’ commitment to grassroots and democracy.
Another focus will be fundraising, which Kuttner proudly states has turned around since their appointment.
Donors do seem to have opened their wallets since Paul announced her resignation. More money came in following the 2021 election than in 2019, and the party raised more than twice as much cash in December 2021 as it did in December 2019.
The party made painful decisions last year to cut costs. It went through a first round of layoffs in July, then hired staff back for the election, only to lay off 11 people again in October. Grievances are expected.
The party also ended contracts and renegotiated its office lease. Despite the board saying it is considering “possible termination of the Ottawa office lease in 2022,” Kuttner insists the Greens will maintain a physical presence in the capital. “There is no question of getting rid of it entirely,” they said. “We can just have a smaller office or something.”
Kuttner’s major agenda item, though, is to help ensure a good and clean leadership contest, free of ballot problems and — they hope — with fewer divisions.
Last time, Kuttner says some members didn’t receive ballots “until after the contest had closed,” and others whose contact information was a phone number were never contacted to make sure they received a ballot.
“I don’t know the numbers,” they add, “but they are significant.”
Initially, Kuttner says they were not convinced that the voting errors would have changed the outcome of the race. “ I didn’t feel like I wanted to rub it in, to create any more issues here over questioning anyone’s right to be leader.
“But the truth is, I really don’t think the outcome [was fair], since there were so many problems with it.”
The Greens’ leadership race must start within six months of the interim leader’s appointment — by May 24 — and last a maximum of 24 months. Kuttner hopes it’s short, focused and doesn’t lead to too many rounds of voting, so the party can come together more easily afterwards.
Few of the 2020 entrants plan on running again, but Lascaris told me he’s still considering it. Kuttner won’t.
They are still soured by their experience in the 2019 federal election, running against NDP star candidate Svend Robinson, whom Kuttner says bullied them. “Whether he intended it or not, he was abusive.”
Robinson denies the allegations and told Kuttner they should apologize to him .
If the government falls before summer, Kuttner has said they’ll run as a candidate but otherwise, they’re unsure.
“I don’t feel like I can go into a partisan fight on a personal level while I’m this [physically] vulnerable,” they said.
Instead, Kuttner is relishing leading in this interim role.
“ I believe in the importance of the party as an effective tool, and I want to help them mobilize to get to that point.”

Ford dropped rent control on new units in 2018. Since then thousands have come online, and tenants facing double-digit increases ask: was it worth it?

Full text: Maria Chubulu thought she hit the Toronto rental jackpot.
An “amazing,” brand-new one-bedroom condo, never occupied by another tenant, just a few minutes’ walk from the waterfront. Through the window, she could see the CN Tower. And best of all, she signed the lease in January 2021 , when downtown asking rents were lower than usual.
But her monthly rent bill — originally set at $1,950 — is now expected to surge.
The exact amount is still up in the air, Chubulu said, but her landlord has suggested increasing the rate to between $2,350 and $2,650 this spring — a jump of between 20.5 and 35.9 per cent.
That would be allowed under a three-year-old exemption to Ontario’s rent control rules, for units first occupied after Nov. 15, 2018, introduced by Doug Ford’s Progressive Conservatives not long after forming government.
“I had absolutely no idea,” Chubulu said of the exemption.
More than 7,500 purpose-built rental units have been built in Toronto alone since the policy was enacted, says market research firm Urbanation, plus an untold number of condos and other homes rented out by investors.
And as the years go on, more and more tenants are finding themselves in units without rent control and facing the prospect of large rent spikes.
The provincial government, backed by some academics and industry players, says the rent control exemption is a way to incentivize the development of much-needed rental supply with hopes of pushing rents down.
But other academics and advocates argue the trade-off for tenants facing a lack of stability is too steep, and that the number of units actually built since the policy came into force hasn’t been enough to address demand.
And with a pandemic-era rent freeze ending last month, Urbanation president Shaun Hildebrand expects some tenants who signed leases mid-COVID-19 — when some landlords offered lower rents or incentives amid lower demand — may see higher-than-expected jumps.
“I think some tenants are going to face a bit of a shock,” he said.
Among them is Rasool Moradi Dastjerdi. Early in the pandemic, he also saw an opportunity to find a better home, for himself, his wife and their then-three-year-old daughter. The family had previously been squeezing into in a one-bedroom unit in an older Toronto building.
For only a few hundred dollars more, Dastjerdi found a newer, one-plus-den condo near enough to the University of Toronto, where he works as a postdoctoral fellow. But this fall, he says his landlord suggested the $1,760 rent they agreed to could increase to $2,150 for 2022.
Shocked, Moradi Dastjerdi insisted it couldn’t be allowed, pointing to the maximum annual increase set out by the province — 1.2 per cent for 2022. His landlord replied, Moradi Dastjerdi told the Star, by pointing out the 2018 exemption for newly occupied units.
“They are providing this (exemption) to help, I don’t know who,” he said. It’s a rule that he believes adds financial pressure on tenants, increases the risk of landlord-tenant conflicts and assists investors over residents.
Hildebrand says his firm has seen an uptick in purpose-built rental development in Toronto over the last three years. He believes the policy change has contributed to that rise, but said it was likely not the only factor.
Where Urbanation counted between 1,000 and 1,300 new purpose-built rental units completed per year between 2016 and 2018, Hildebrand said they’re expecting 4,805 new units this year and 4,246 next year.
However, more than 3,000 rental units were completed in 2019 that would have been in development well before the policy change, he said. And he’s observed piqued interest in recent years from institutional investors such as pension funds in the purpose-built rental sector.
He also cautioned numbers were still low compared to what’s needed.
To David Hulchanski, a housing expert with the University of Toronto, the increase hasn’t been sizeable enough to justify the policy. He believes bygone subsidies and incentives such as the federal Multi-Unit Residential Building program of the 1970s — which offered tax advantages to stimulate rental construction — were far more effective in boosting supply.
Though he doesn’t believe the exemption will wound the city’s most vulnerable tenants — newly built units, he said, were often rented out at higher prices to begin with — he thinks more renters ought to be aware of the rules and whether their unit qualifies before signing a lease.
“People who are in those units should know,” he said. “There are no regulations at all in terms of the annual rent increases, unlike other similar units, maybe across the street but a couple years older.”
Frank Clayton, a senior research fellow at Ryerson’s Centre for Urban Research and Land Development, believes the policy has been helpful, but that it’s also limited. Even if a developer was encouraged by the 2018 change, Clayton said, they likely knew it could be time-limited, with the potential for a new government and new rent control regime every four years.
“If you’re an investor looking at buying a brand-new rental project ... you want to get a certain income. And if there’s uncertainty in that income, there is higher risk, and you might not do it.”
With months to go until the next election, Ontario politicians have already been sparring over rent control.
At Queen’s Park in October, NDP housing critic Jessica Bell raised the case of a tenant reportedly facing a 57 per cent spike. Government house leader Paul Calandra defended the exemption in response, arguing it could herald in more supply to push rents prices down.
Meanwhile, both Chubulu and Moradi Dastjerdi are still waiting to hear about their 2022 rates.
Moradi Dastjerdi says his landlord has softened their original proposal, offering a 10.8 per cent increase instead: $1,950 per month, starting in March. It’s still more than he feels he can afford.
Chuburu says she could afford an increase, but is frustrated by the exemption’s lack of limits. Even if someone was a great tenant, she said, it may not beat out the lure of a higher profit.
“It doesn’t become about the people living there,” she said. “It becomes about money.”

Full text: Former federal NDP leader Alexa McDonough, a political trailblazer who paved the way for women in politics, died Saturday in Halifax at the age of 77.
Her family confirmed McDonough's death after a lengthy struggle with Alzheimer's disease.
McDonough was elected leader of the Nova Scotia New Democrats in 1980. She became leader of the federal NDP in 1995 and served in the party's top post until 2002.
But in an interview Saturday, Justin McDonough said his mother was a consensus builder who earned respect beyond partisan political lines.
"I think the one thing that I really learned from her is that you can have courageous conversations and you can disagree with someone, but it doesn't mean that you aren't going to be respectful and you're not going to appreciate their opinion," he said. "Her political life resonated in that regard."
Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston paid tribute in a statement calling McDonough a historic figure in provincial and federal politics.
"The hallmark of Ms. McDonough's long career was her respect for the people she represented," Houston said. "She was a public servant in the truest sense and she will be sorely missed by people across Canada."
Known affectionately to many across the country as simply "Alexa," McDonough was a former social worker who cut her political teeth in the Nova Scotia Liberal Party before switching to the provincial NDP in 1974.
After capturing the party's leadership, she became the first New Democrat from mainland Nova Scotia to sit in the provincial legislature when she was elected in a Halifax area riding in 1981. She was the party's lone voice in the legislature over the next three years.
"These are accomplishments of real historic stature," said Gary Burrill, the current leader of the Nova Scotia NDP. "She is a big person on the landscape in the history of the province."
Burrill said Nova Scotia New Democrats have suffered a significant loss and are a "party in mourning."
McDonough resigned as provincial leader in 1994 and later made the jump to federal politics, where she mounted a challenge for the national party's top job in 1995. She won the federal NDP leadership in an upset over perceived front-runners Svend Robinson and Lorne Nystrom.
She was elected to the House of Commons for the first time during the 1997 federal election, while her party's seat count went from nine to 21. That total included a breakthrough in Atlantic Canada, where the New Democrats took six of Nova Scotia's 11 seats.
"That was a moment that broke the mould of Nova Scotia politics, which had been in place for over a century," Burrill said.
McDonough made her mark federally as a champion of strong social programs and gender equality. She retired from politics in 2008.
Born Alexa Ann Shaw in Ottawa on Aug. 11, 1944, she adopted the name known across the country when she married Peter McDonough in 1966.
McDonough was an Officer of the Order of Canada and a member of the Order of Nova Scotia and is a past president of Mount Saint Vincent University in Halifax.
She is survived by her sons, Justin and Travis, along with seven grandchildren.

Full text: In a major pre-election setback for Premier Doug Ford's Progressive Conservatives, Long-Term Care Minister Rod Phillips is retiring from politics.
Phillips, a key cabinet minister who has represented Ajax since 2018, announced Friday he would not be running in the June 2 election.
"I have spoken with Premier Ford and with Brian Patterson, president of the Ontario PC Party, to inform them of my decision not to seek re-election and to step down next month as the MPP for Ajax," Phillips, 56, said in a written statement.
"This will allow the premier to appoint a successor to continue the important work of the Ministry of Long-Term Care. It also ensures that the PC Party has the time needed to nominate a candidate in Ajax and prepare for the provincial election," he said.
"I have always considered public service a privilege and it has been an honour to serve as the MPP for Ajax and in three cabinet portfolios. That said, my professional life has been spent in the business world and I look forward to returning to the private sector."
His surprise departure is a political blow to Ford, coming just 20 weeks before what public opinion polls suggest could be a close election.
On Twitter, the premier thanked Phillips "for his tireless work representing the people of Ajax and advancing important and necessary improvements in Ontario's long-term care system."
"I want to wish him and Lydia the very best in their next chapter. I have no doubt there are great things for Rod ahead," said Ford, who on Friday night appointed Paul Calandra, minister of legislative affairs and government house leader, to also be long-term care minister.
For his part, Phillips praised the premier's "strong leadership ... through what is undoubtedly the greatest challenge of our lifetimes, the global COVID-19 pandemic.
Since taking over the embattled Ministry of Long-Term Care last June, Phillips has been credited for helping to improve Ontario's pandemic-ravaged nursing homes, which suffered greatly in the first waves of COVID-19. But about half of all nursing homes are currently battling outbreaks as the highly contagious Omicron variant spreads.
Along with joining ministry inspectors on surprise spot-checks of homes, he implemented a mandatory vaccination policy for all staff and ensured hefty increases to operating budgets and infrastructure investments in an area long neglected by successive governments of all political stripes.
"Our work together has been the most meaningful in my time as a minister of the Crown," Phillips said of the long-term care sector.
"Together we have protected residents with the toughest legislation and best enforcement in the country, moved ahead with the largest long-term-care building program ever in Canada and invested in training and hiring tens of thousands of new, front-line health-care staff. All while continuing to do everything possible to vaccinate and protect residents and staff through this latest wave of the global pandemic."
But NDP MPP Sara Singh (Brampton Centre) said Phillips's resignation suggests Ford's government is in disarray.
"Outbreaks and staff shortages are surging in long-term-care homes again, leaving residents at risk. This is not the first time the government has changed long-term-care ministers when residents were in the middle of a crisis," said Singh, referring to former minister Merrilee Fullerton.
Liberal Steven Del Duca said the "abrupt departure ... while more than half of Ontario's nursing homes have COVID outbreaks is a total abdication of leadership and a sign of pure chaos in Ford's Conservative party."
"Doug Ford's incompetence has turned a health crisis into a crisis of leadership," said Del Duca, who also thanked the minister "for his years of public service."
Phillips made headlines in December 2020 when he went on vacation to the Caribbean island of St. Barts at a time when the federal government was urging Canadians to avoid non-essential travel.
Even though the premier's office was aware of the Christmas trip, he resigned as finance minister upon his return to spare Ford further political embarrassment.
But his absence from the executive council coincided with some of the Tories' most chaotic months of the pandemic, culminating in a marathon two-day cabinet meeting last April when ministers decided to impose police spot checks and close playgrounds to curb the spread of COVID-19.
Those controversial moves were abandoned the next day amid a massive outcry from Ontarians and directly contributed to a displeased Ford shuffling his cabinet weeks later and handing Phillips the challenging long-term-care file.
A successful business leader before entering elected politics, Phillips served as chair of Postmedia, parent company of the National Post and the Toronto Sun, and in 2011 was appointed president and CEO of Ontario Lottery and Gaming by Liberal premier Dalton McGuinty.
In 2014, he succeeded Toronto Mayor John Tory as chair of the non-partisan CivicAction urban affairs organization. He also served as mayor Mel Lastman's chief of staff after the 1998 amalgamation of the old city of Toronto with North York, Etobicoke, Scarborough, York and East York.
Long mentioned as a potential successor to Ford as Progressive Conservative leader, Phillips's retirement jolts the political landscape as ministers begin jockeying for positioning in a future leadership contest.

Full text: Let’s get one thing straight right out of the gate. The Ontario government’s decision to return children to physical classrooms next week wasn’t made out of genuine concern for student welfare. It was made out of genuine concern for its own welfare in an election year.
It was made to quiet the desperate anger of parents struggling to work with kids at home — kids who are struggling in their own right with social and physical isolation but who will almost surely face a different challenge when they return to the classroom on Jan. 17: the widespread infection of their peers and teachers with the outrageously infectious Omicron variant.
I don’t say any of this to be alarmist. I say it because it is alarming.
The Omicron variant is not only putting immense strain on hospitals (Peel Memorial urgent care centre closed this week due to capacity and staffing issues), but the life-saving services that bring people to them. According to the Star’s David Rider , city of Toronto staffing levels saw an unplanned absence rate “of more than 10 per cent across all city divisions and 12.8 per cent for emergency services on Sunday.”
The government belatedly prioritized education workers for booster shots and announced it will provide them with N95s. But according to provincial data only 45 per cent of Ontario students aged 5-11 have received a first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine: a dangerously low vaccination rate amid surging child hospitalizations across the continent (not to mention the unknowns about the long-term effects of COVID-19 on kids).
“We expect this [Omicron] will peak the third, fourth week of January,” Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott said at a news conference Tuesday afternoon. In other words, she expects it will peak precisely when kids return to school. Worse, if it makes an appearance in your own kid’s classroom you may not even be told.
According to a provincial government document, “Given the widespread transmission and inability to test all symptomatic individuals, schools will not be routinely notifying students/pupils in classes with a positive case, or if a child/student or staff is absent due to symptoms associated with COVID-19.”
“Our government has done everything we can to make schools safe,” Elliott said Tuesday. But isn’t routinely notifying students when they are exposed to a potentially deadly virus the bare minimum of making schools safe?
Isn’t making COVID-19 vaccines mandatory for students (as several other vaccines already are in school) the bare minimum of making schools safe?
Isn’t mandating good quality masks for students (as opposed to the cloth masks many students in Ontario wear daily and which have been deemed weak protection against Omicron) the bare minimum of making schools safe?
And — please forgive me for saying so — but might waiting a few weeks before sending kids back to physical school be the safest thing to do while Omicron burdens our hospitals and nearly every essential sector imaginable? Do we really want thousands of unvaccinated children eating lunch in congregate settings during peak Omicron?
I don’t make this case lightly.
I know what it’s like to have a little kid literally bouncing off the walls at home right now. Parents of school-aged children want a return to normal. Parents of toddlers want an introduction to normal. Many of our kids (my own included) were born in the pandemic. They are desperate for social interaction and activity beyond the four walls of their homes. My 18-month-old daughter’s big daily outing during this particularly frigid lockdown is jumping up and down on a street vent outside our house. The bleakness of this moment is not lost on me. But neither is the reality.
My brother is a teacher who is immunocompromised. Omicron is ripping through Ontario. It’s about to rip through our schools. The provincial government appears to have made peace with this. If you’re a parent looking into next week, ask yourself, have you?

Full text: When I go to vote this June in the Ontario election I’ll be greatly tempted to write in François Legault’s name on my ballot.
Yes, I know the Quebec premier won’t be running in the June 2 provincial election. Still, his decision this week to impose a “significant” tax on unvaxxed Quebec residents has my vote.
That’s because Legault is taking bold steps to get tough with people who still refuse to get jabbed against COVID-19 — unlike Ontario Premier Doug Ford and federal Conservative leader Erin O’Toole, who both continue to coddle anti-vaxxers.
Enough with trying to play nice! It’s time to crack down on the unvaccinated!
Legault deserves to be cheered by all of us who are fed up with politicians who think they can still sweet-talk the anti-vaxxers into getting their shots.
His move this week to impose a financial hardship on the 10 per cent of the population that won’t get vaccinated is the sort of action the 90 per cent of adults who are fully vaccinated have been longing to see from our political leaders.
It’s especially true in Legault’s case, especially after his decision a week earlier to make vaccination mandatory for anyone entering provincial alcohol or cannabis stores, which resulted in an immediate increase in the daily average of first-shot appointments from 1,500 to 6,000 .
Indeed, a poll conducted by Maru Public Opinion for the Toronto Sun found that 60 per cent of Canadians support the idea of a special health tax for the unvaccinated . Another poll released this week by Leger and the Association of Canadian Studies showed 64 per cent of respondents support vaccine passports for malls and retail stores, while 61 favour them for public transit users.
But in Ontario, Ford has kept the door open to eliminating vaccine passports as soon as possible, giving comfort to the strident anti-vaxxers who are simply waiting for the government to act. In Ottawa, O’Toole is talking about making “accommodations” for the unvaxxed , whatever that means. O’Toole couldn’t — or wouldn’t — say.
It’s long been popular for political leaders such as Ford and O’Toole to believe Canadians are timorous and docile.
Well, just wait — people have had it!
They’ve had it with the unvaccinated who are responsible for overcrowded hospitals and falling staffing levels because of COVID, putting everyone — including themselves — at risk.
They’ve had it with seeing huge gaps in hospitalization and death rates between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated.
They’ve had it with anti-vaxxers and their political enablers talking about the need to defend personal freedoms. But your personal freedom doesn’t mean you can become a modern-day Typhoid Mary.
They’ve had it with talk about “slippery slopes” and the danger of increased government intervention in our daily lives, and of the potential threat of creating a two-tier health-care system.
Canadians who’ve lost patience with the unvaccinated aren’t alone — and more and more politicians around the world are paying attention.
In France, President Emmanuel Macron pushed for a strict ban on the unvaxxed being allowed to dine indoors, see a movie or get on a train — even if they tested negative for COVID. “The unvaccinated, I really want to piss them off,” he said . “That’s the strategy.”
In Austria, unvaxxed residents will soon have to pay huge fines every three months . In Italy, all workers over the age of 50 will be suspended from work unless they are vaccinated or provide a negative COVID test. And in Australia, the vast majority of those polled want anti-vax tennis star Novak Djokovic deported after he entered the country on a questionable visa .
Politicians who ignore this hardening line by the vaccinated toward the unvaccinated may be doing so at their own risk.
François Legault clearly understands this risk. Doug Ford and Erin O’Toole clearly don’t — or worse, don’t care.

Full text: Blame Doug Ford.
If anyone else were premier, everything else would be better.
Schools would stay closed. Schools would stay open.
All at the same time.
It would be possible in the worst of times to please everyone at the same time. No more Ford, no more waves, no more problems.
Business would be back in business without limits. Business would be locked down without letup.
Without Ford as premier, we'd also be without Stephen Lecce as education minister. And Lecce would never dare to vacation in Florida while teachers were forced to the front lines in classrooms.
If all of the above sounds satirically simplistic and impossibly contradictory, it assuredly is.
No, despite the cascading rumours on Twitter, Lecce never left the province. In fact, he co-hosted a news conference Wednesday with chief medical officer of health Dr. Kieran Moore to explain the return to school this Monday:
Ten million N95 respirators for teachers, alone among the provinces. Rapid testing kits for kids despite a global shortage. More filters for schools, not to mention a mask mandate for the earliest grades before anyone else in Canada.
But still not what critics are asking for: Ford and Lecce and Moore could offer no guarantees that students or teachers could not catch COVID-19 in the classroom.
I don't fault anyone for fearing infection - parents, teachers, unionists, columnists, oppositionists - but at what cost in isolation? Two years after COVID took root in Ontario, and two weeks after Ontario closed classrooms, it's time to take stock - and stop the shock tactics that are a prescription for paralysis.
Should two weeks become four weeks, and then two months? How many semesters and how much longer do we want to keep kids out of classrooms in pursuit of zero COVID, when the goalposts keep getting moved back and waves keep coming back?
The answer, according to many of the critics, is that Ford is the problem. And Lecce is a lightning rod.
There is no shortage of short-sightedness by Ford's Tories - from environmental recklessness to ideological ignorance - that cries out for accountability in the coming election campaign, quite apart from COVID. But to pretend that Ontario has mismanaged the pandemic while other provinces have outdone us - from B.C.'s besieged NDP government to Quebec's bizarre curfew regime - is public deception and self-delusion.
If blaming government and demonizing Ford makes people feel better, so be it. But it's a political mirage and a journalistic crutch.
There is no magic bullet, short of universal vaccination, that will do the trick. As much as I wish everyone would roll up their sleeves and those of their young children - with enough jabs to go around the world - we are still a long way off.
Until then, a couple of reality checks:
I was sympathetic to the idea of a two-week "circuit-breaker" after family gatherings over the holidays, which also gave school boards more time to brace for the Omicron onslaught and inevitable absenteeism. But parents who are still afraid of sending their children back to class - and critics who insist on amplifying their fears - should remember that most school boards will still let them hold kids back by requesting an online exemption.
Stay away if you wish. But do not keep everyone else out of class until your fears are assuaged.
Bear in mind that young children are far less likely to suffer dire consequences from catching COVID. That's why, as so many pedagogical and pediatric experts keep reminding us publicly, the "cure" - keeping them from school and depriving them of in-class learning - is worse than the disease.
We can try to vaccinate our way out of COVID, but must also recognize the reality of parental hesitancy. While roughly nine out of 10 adults in this province are vaccinated, and almost as many teens have taken the jab, less than half of kids aged five to 11 have been inoculated to date.
The unvaccinated will still be vulnerable to illness and act as vectors for transmission. That's why it should be mandatory for students of all ages to be vaccinated for COVID, not unlike the way we handle other infectious diseases.
Many parents who believe in vaccines for themselves aren't ready to put their kids in line - and on the line. That's where our politicians and public health doctors must be bolder, by making a strong case for the benefits of vaccination, the minimal risks of complications, and the far greater risks of illness from COVID.
All students should be compelled to report their vaccination status for COVID as for other communicable diseases, and it should be made a condition of enrolment with few exceptions. At Wednesday's briefing, Moore pointed out that no other jurisdiction has yet done so, which only sends mixed signals (the doctor later issued a statement clarifying that he strongly endorses the shots for children).
The sooner we send a clear signal - even if only to set a date in advance - the faster parents will understand the inevitability and desirability of vaccines for all schoolchildren of all ages.
We cannot delay forever, and we cannot keep fighting over school closings to the last child. Nor can we forget the burden borne by older students in colleges and universities, many of whom remain in limbo - locked out of their campuses for weeks to come by unaccountable administrators, despite vaccination rates that are virtually universal.
Who better than an elementary school teacher with two kids in university to make that point to me this week. Let's give her the last word:
"As a parent of two young men attending Queen's and Laurier, I can attest to the negative impact on their lives," Kerri Noer wrote me Wednesday as her own Toronto school was getting set to open its doors.
"As an elementary teacher, I (will) happily return to the classroom next week because I witness the social, emotional and academic benefits for the children being in the classroom over the risks. The same applies to university students who are suffering but no one seems to care."
Who to blame?

Full text: After decades of contentiousness, it's surprising how quickly Canada's new national child-care program has become as familiar and comfortable as your dog's favourite squeeze-toy.
Or maybe it isn't surprising. Why wouldn't Canadians welcome a program that makes their lives as parents so much easier, giving them the freedom to work if they want while sparing them the exorbitant costs - often compared to a second mortgage - of child care?
Now that it's arrived, the $30-billion national child-care program, announced by the Trudeau government last April after years of Liberal stalling and Conservative opposition, seems like a no-brainer. The aim is to provide $10-a-day child care across the country by 2026.
The plan is being hailed as an important first step that could lead to the development a strong, public child-care system - with strict limits on private profit-making.
So far, even provinces with Conservative governments are on board with the new plan.
Ontario is the lone provincial holdout, but the Doug Ford government has signalled negotiations with the feds are going well and a deal is likely soon.
This has prompted accusations that Ford is deliberately stalling negotiations so the new program can be announced closer to the provincial election this spring.
But hold it! Is it possible that Ford - always keen to cut government spending - wants to ensure he gets credit for bringing the province into a new program that dramatically expands the role of government?
Apparently, yes. Similarly, hard-right Alberta Premier Jason Kenney signed a child-care deal with Ottawa last November.
Right-wing ideologues like Kenney and Ford typically resist any suggestion of expanding social programs.
But when the idea turns into a concrete plan with $30 billion attached to it, offering such clear advantages that ordinary citizens get excited at the prospect - even conservative premiers have trouble saying no. Their desire to win re-election trumps their inner ideologue.
And, of course, once implemented, social programs quickly become popular, making it difficult for conservative governments to scale them back.
That's why right-wing think-tanks and business groups try to derail social program expansion while it's still on the drawing boards, by insisting we can't afford it - an objection that is never raised against government plans to spend enormous sums on, say, military jets.
We hear little about how popular and generous social programs are in Europe, particularly in Scandinavian countries, where child care isn't just affordable but is actually spectacular - housed in beautiful buildings with well-designed play spaces indoors and outdoors, and providing warm and tasty meals.
Compare this to Canada, where child care, when available, is often housed in makeshift quarters, with few resources and underpaid staff.
It's weird that we put such a low priority on providing for our children.
Of course, right-wingers argue that child care should be an individual responsibility. That's fine for families that can afford expensive child care or even live-in nannies. But if the goal is to provide excellent care for all children, a public system is the most cost-effective; it's really the only viable option.
And now that it's clear a national child-care system is politically viable, it will be up to the Trudeau government to ensure that the one it's started to build is strong - and public.
The success of Scandinavian-style child care stems from the fact that it is a truly public system - like our school system - with no place for private profit-making, which leads to cutting corners on staff and resources.
But child care is a big international business, and a growing portion of Canada's child care is provided by corporate chains that are anxious to expand here.
The real test for the Trudeau government will be whether the billions it's investing in child care will be used to build a strong public system - or get scooped up by child-care multinationals spotting an easy and reliable source of cash.

Johnson apologizes for attending party

Full text: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson sought to head off a growing revolt within his own party, offering an apology for attending what he called a "work" event in the Downing Street garden during lockdown, when outside parties were illegal.
"There were things we simply did not get right," he told the House of Commons on Wednesday. "I must take responsibility."
The rare apology came after Johnson and his officials had spent days stonewalling after ITV reported that the premier's senior adviser had invited about 100 people to a drinks party in the No. 10 garden in May 2020. Such gatherings were banned at the time in the United Kingdom.
Johnson said he believed the event was a work event, and he went into the Downing Street garden to thank groups of staff.
"With hindsight I should have sent everyone back inside," he said. "I regret very much we did not do things differently that evening."
Members of Johnson's ruling Conservative party had warned the prime minister his silence was untenable and that his position would be at risk unless he gave a clear account of what happened - and especially if it turned out he had lied about the party and others reported to have happened that year.
The allegations, which have dominated newspaper front pages and driven a steep decline in support for the Tories in opinion polls, represent a significant moment of peril at the worst possible time for Johnson. The prime minister had hoped to begin 2022 with a reset after a turbulent end to last year, which culminated in a damaging loss in a special election.
Instead, Johnson found himself answering questions on alleged law-breaking by a former director of public prosecutions. Opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer had been released from self-isolation after contracting COVID-19 just hours before the critical session. "That apology was pretty worthless," Starmer said as he called for Johnson to resign.

Martin Regg Cohn: Doug Ford has made a lot of bad decisions. Reopening schools isn't one of them

Full text: Blame Doug Ford.
If anyone else were premier, everything else would be better.
Schools would stay closed. Schools would stay open.
All at the same time.
It would be possible in the worst of times to please everyone at the same time. No more Ford, no more waves, no more problems.
Business would be back in business without limits. Business would be locked down without letup.
Without Ford as premier, we’d also be without Stephen Lecce as education minister. And Lecce would never dare to vacation in Florida while teachers were forced to the front lines in classrooms.
If all of the above sounds satirically simplistic and impossibly contradictory, it assuredly is.
No, despite the cascading rumours on Twitter, Lecce never left the province. In fact, he co-hosted a news conference Wednesday with chief medical officer of health Dr. Kieran Moore to explain the return to school this Monday:
Ten million N95 respirators for teachers, alone among the provinces. Rapid testing kits for kids despite a global shortage. More filters for schools, not to mention a mask mandate for the earliest grades before anyone else in Canada.
But still not what critics are asking for: Ford and Lecce and Moore could offer no guarantees that students or teachers could not catch COVID-19 in the classroom.
I don’t fault anyone for fearing infection — parents, teachers, unionists, columnists, oppositionists — but at what cost in isolation? Two years after COVID took root in Ontario, and two weeks after Ontario closed classrooms, it’s time to take stock — and stop the shock tactics that are a prescription for paralysis.
Should two weeks become four weeks, and then two months? How many semesters and how much longer do we want to keep kids out of classrooms in pursuit of zero COVID, when the goalposts keep getting moved back and waves keep coming back?
The answer, according to many of the critics, is that Ford is the problem. And Lecce is a lightning rod.
There is no shortage of short-sightedness by Ford’s Tories — from environmental recklessness to ideological ignorance — that cries out for accountability in the coming election campaign, quite apart from COVID. But to pretend that Ontario has mismanaged the pandemic while other provinces have outdone us — from B.C.’s besieged NDP government to Quebec’s bizarre curfew regime — is public deception and self-delusion.
If blaming government and demonizing Ford makes people feel better, so be it. But it’s a political mirage and a journalistic crutch.
There is no magic bullet, short of universal vaccination, that will do the trick. As much as I wish everyone would roll up their sleeves and those of their young children — with enough jabs to go around the world — we are still a long way off.
Until then, a couple of reality checks:
I was sympathetic to the idea of a two-week “circuit-breaker” after family gatherings over the holidays, which also gave school boards more time to brace for the Omicron onslaught and inevitable absenteeism. But parents who are still afraid of sending their children back to class — and critics who insist on amplifying their fears — should remember that most school boards will still let them hold kids back by requesting an online exemption.
Stay away if you wish. But do not keep everyone else out of class until your fears are assuaged.
Bear in mind that young children are far less likely to suffer dire consequences from catching COVID. That’s why, as so many pedagogical and pediatric experts keep reminding us publicly, the “cure” — keeping them from school and depriving them of in-class learning — is worse than the disease.
We can try to vaccinate our way out of COVID, but must also recognize the reality of parental hesitancy. While roughly nine out of 10 adults in this province are vaccinated, and almost as many teens have taken the jab, less than half of kids aged five to 11 have been inoculated to date.
The unvaccinated will still be vulnerable to illness and act as vectors for transmission. That’s why it should be mandatory for students of all ages to be vaccinated for COVID, not unlike the way we handle other infectious diseases.
Many parents who believe in vaccines for themselves aren’t ready to put their kids in line — and on the line. That’s where our politicians and public health doctors must be bolder, by making a strong case for the benefits of vaccination, the minimal risks of complications, and the far greater risks of illness from COVID.
All students should be compelled to report their vaccination status for COVID as for other communicable diseases, and it should be made a condition of enrolment with few exceptions. At Wednesday’s briefing, Moore pointed out that no other jurisdiction has yet done so, which only sends mixed signals (the doctor later issued a statement clarifying that he strongly endorses the shots for children).
The sooner we send a clear signal — even if only to set a date in advance — the faster parents will understand the inevitability and desirability of vaccines for all schoolchildren of all ages.
We cannot delay forever, and we cannot keep fighting over school closings to the last child. Nor can we forget the burden borne by older students in colleges and universities, many of whom remain in limbo — locked out of their campuses for weeks to come by unaccountable administrators, despite vaccination rates that are virtually universal.
Who better than an elementary school teacher with two kids in university to make that point to me this week. Let’s give her the last word:
“As a parent of two young men attending Queen’s and Laurier, I can attest to the negative impact on their lives,” Kerri Noer wrote me Wednesday as her own Toronto school was getting set to open its doors.
“As an elementary teacher, I (will) happily return to the classroom next week because I witness the social, emotional and academic benefits for the children being in the classroom over the risks. The same applies to university students who are suffering but no one seems to care.”

Full text: Former prime minister Stephen Harper is once again going to bat for Peter MacKay in a bid to help him pay off his debt from the 2020 Conservative party leadership race.
Sixteen months after the contest, MacKay still owes about $500,000 and in a letter to party members and supporters this week, Harper said people need to help him pay that down.
"I understand that times are tight, but I do not want to see Peter and his family's future weighed down by debt incurred in the service of our country and our Conservative party," Harper wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by the Star.
MacKay was considered the front-runner heading into the leadership contest, which began after Andrew Scheer announced in December 2019 that he intended to step down.
The COVID-19 pandemic began just months later, forcing the lion's share of campaigning and fundraising into the virtual sphere and delaying the vote.
The winner was ultimately chosen in a mail-in vote using ranked ballots.
MacKay lost after supporters of candidates Derek Sloan and Leslyn Lewis backed Erin O'Toole.
In his letter, Harper called MacKay's leadership bid "a strong and thoughtful campaign," and noted his long-standing ties to the party.
MacKay was the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada when it merged with Harper's Canadian Alliance to create the current Conservative party.
In the letter, Harper acknowledged MacKay's role in founding the modern party, as well as the cabinet positions he later held in Harper's Conservative government.
"I believe that people who serve the country deserve our support," he wrote.
"That is why I am asking you today to contribute to the effort to pay down Peter's remaining leadership campaign debt."
It's not the first time Harper has come out to support MacKay.
Harper and former prime minister Brian Mulroney have held private fundraisers to help with MacKay's campaign expenses. In the letter, he notes that the pandemic means such events are not going to be possible in the foreseeable future.
MacKay spent about $4.6 million on his leadership bid, and ended the race with about $1 million in debt, a figure his campaign has said was pushed higher by the need to hire private security in the wake of threats against his family during the race.
He's been whittling away at it ever since, and with a new calendar year meaning a clean slate for donation limits, his campaign is hoping to see the final $500,000 brought down further in the coming months.
MacKay moved his family from Toronto to his home province of Nova Scotia after the leadership race, and chose to remain on the sidelines after considering a run in last year's federal election.

Former Tory cabinet minister Jeff Yurek says he won't run again

Full text: A veteran Progressive Conservative MPP and former cabinet minister is quitting politics next month.
Jeff Yurek (Elgin-Middlesex-London) has announced he will not be running in the June 2 Ontario election, and is resigning his seat at the end of February.
“My time in public life has run its course. I believe it time for the voters of EML to select a new voice to represent their interests at Queen’s Park,” he said in a Facebook post Friday.
Demoted from cabinet last June by Premier Doug Ford, Yurek, who was first elected in 2011, had been minister of environment, transportation and natural resources since 2018.
“At the cabinet table I stood strong, being a persuasive voice for rural and southwestern Ontario,” he said.
But Yurek was purged in a massive shuffle that saw the premier overhaul his cabinet late last spring over concerns that some rural ministers were “anti-lockdown” and encouraged him to reopen the economy too quickly during the COVID-19 pandemic’s third wave last February.
“Those legacy MPPs (in cabinet) who are in safe seats, and have been anti-lockdown, were a big part of why the premier opened things too fast in February and closed things too slowly in April,” a senior official confided last year before the cabinet changes.
On Twitter, Ford thanked Yurek “for his time and dedication in serving the people of Elgin-Middlesex-London.”
“Congratulations Jeff on all that you accomplished during your 10 years as an MPP. Wishing you, your wife and daughter all the best as you enter the next chapter,” the premier said.
No byelection will be called to fill the vacant seat as the general election is fewer than five months away.
Yurek is the latest MPP to announce he is retiring.
Other Tories who aren’t running include Christina Mitas (Scarborough Centre), Gila Martow (Thornhill), Amy Fee (Kitchener South-Hespeler), Norm Miller (Parry Sound-Muskoka), Jim McDonnell (Stormount-Dundas-South Glengarry), and Randy Pettapiece (Perth-Wellington).
Liberal former premier Kathleen Wynne , who has represented Don Valley West since 2003, is not seeking re-election.
Neither are New Democrats Ian Arthur (Kingston and the Islands), Percy Hatfield (Windsor-Tecumseh) and Taras Natyshak (Essex).
After Yurek’s retirement, the 124-member legislature will have 68 Tories — including speaker Ted Arnott, who does not caucus with the government — 40 New Democrats, seven Liberals, five Independents, one Green, one New Blue MPP, and there will be two vacancies.

Today's coronavirus news: Quebec plans 'significant' tax for the unvaccinated; Ontario to deploy more internationally trained nurses to help with Omicron surge

Full text: The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Tuesday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available.
4:45 p.m.: The Black Health Alliance says Quebec's proposal to bring in a financial penalty for unvaccinated residents risks further entrenching inequities in Canada's pandemic response and eroding trust in the government.
Quebec Premier François Legault announced Tuesday the province is working on a health-care "contribution" that would be charged to all adults who refuse to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
Provinces do not keep socioeconomic or race-based data about who has or hasn't received a full slate of shots, but several health equity experts say there is evidence some have fallen through the cracks.
Black Health Alliance executive director Paul Bailey says the tax could punish people who have been hesitant to receive vaccines because of historic and present-day injustices, or face systemic barriers to accessing the vaccine.
He suggests instead doubling down on proven measures of combating vaccine hesitancy by engaging with people in a culturally responsive way.
He says a tax would only set those efforts backwards.
4:15 p.m.: New Brunswick's chief epidemiologist says if current trends continue, the province could see 5,500 people testing positive each day for COVID-19 by the end of the month.
Mathieu Chalifoux told a news conference in Fredericton today that could result in nearly 220 people in hospital.
There are currently a record 88 people hospitalized with COVID-19 in the province, including 14 in intensive care and 11 on a ventilator.
Chief medical officer of health Dr. Jennifer Russell says New Brunswickers can help flatten the curve by further limiting their contacts.
The Edmundston Regional Hospital and the Saint John Regional Hospital are closing units and reallocating staff in an effort to deal with outbreaks in the hospitals.
There are currently 377 health-care workers who have tested positive for COVID-19 and are isolating, and officials say they expect the impact on front-line staff will increase in the coming weeks.
3:40 p.m.: Scientists are seeing signals that COVID-19′s alarming omicron wave may have peaked in Britain and is about to do the same in the U.S., at which point cases may start dropping off dramatically.
The reason: The variant has proved so wildly contagious that it may already be running out of people to infect, just a month and a half after it was first detected in South Africa.
“It’s going to come down as fast as it went up,” said Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle.
At the same time, experts warn that much is still uncertain about how the next phase of the pandemic might unfold. The plateauing or ebbing in the two countries is not happening everywhere at the same time or at the same pace. And weeks or months of misery still lie ahead for patients and overwhelmed hospitals even if the drop-off comes to pass.

3:30 p.m.: A Nova Scotia government official says 25 of the province's 133 nursing homes are currently not accepting new admissions because of staffing issues partly caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Katelyn Randell, director of long-term care, told the legislature's health committee today that the "pause" on admissions is to allow facilities to address what she says are "staffing gaps."
Randell didn't say how many workers are missing, saying the number changes almost daily.
She says the Department of Seniors and Long-Term Care has assigned more than 19 short-term replacement nurses to help at various facilities.
Meanwhile, health officials reported one new death in the province as a result of novel coronavirus — a man in his 80s in the Halifax area.
They also reported 15 new hospital admissions and 16 discharges bringing the total number of people in hospital due to an infection to 58, with four patients in intensive care.
2:25 p.m. (Update): Quebec is looking at taxing residents who don’t get vaccinated.
Premier François Legault dropped that bombshell Tuesday during a news conference ostensibly arranged to address the resignation a day earlier of his top public health official, Dr. Horacio Arruda .
But after briefly thanking Arruda and naming his replacement, Dr. Luc Boileau, the premier turned his thoughts to the surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations in his province and the number of Quebecers who remain unvaccinated.
“I’m announcing that we are currently working on a health-care contribution that will be charged to all adults in Quebec who refuse to get vaccinated,” said Legault.
“All people who are not vaccinated for non-medical reasons will have to pay a contribution,” Legault said.
He likened the contribution to the drug insurance coverage in Quebec, where, if a person’s employer doesn’t cover drug insurance, the person pays a contribution when they pay their taxes.
Legault said he would be working with his finance minister to sort out the logistics of such a contribution but that it would be a “significant amount.”
“Fifty dollars or $100, for me, is not significant,” said Legault. “But we haven’t yet set the amount.”

2:13 p.m.: Parents in Ontario are exhausted.
With schools closed yet again, working families everywhere have had to deal with the emotional rollercoaster of COVID-19 in schools. It’s been an education no one asked for.
The province has confirmed the province’s 2 million students will be back in classrooms next Monday . Ontario is distributing masks for teachers and students and working to improve filtration in classrooms, the education minister said on Tuesday.
New provincial guidance says that only students and teachers who show symptoms of COVID-19 while at school will have access to PCR tests once schools reopen to in-person learning.
The seven-page document from the Ministry of Health offers guidance on case, contact, and outbreak management for schools and child care settings, and includes new advice on PCR and and rapid antigen testing (RAT).
So, what are some of the things parents want to know before kids head back to school in-person? Send us your questions here .

2 p.m.: Teachers’ unions are expressing safety concerns ahead of schools reopening in Ontario next week, as the government sharply limits access to PCR tests for students and teachers.
Karen Brown, president of the Elementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario, said while many teachers want to return to in-person learning and feel it is the “best way” to engage with students, some are still concerned about whether there will be enough safety measures in place by Monday to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in schools.
Her union and the Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation are calling for more HEPA filters in schools, reduced class sizes to promote physical distancing, along with COVID-19 testing, tracing and monitoring to ensure a safe return to schools.
Brown said she thinks parents should brace themselves “for a lot of interruptions.”
“What they’ve announced so far is not enough,” Brown added.
“We’re almost two years into this pandemic. Why are we still asking for those things? And we need to have testing, we need the rapid antigen testing happening, and the contract tracing to occur.”
1:55 p.m. Quebec Premier Francois Legault says adult residents who refuse to get vaccinated against COVID-19 will be charged a financial penalty.
Legault made the announcement to reporters today in Montreal, adding that the levy will only apply to people who do not qualify for medical exemptions.
It is the first time a government in Canada has announced a financial penalty for people who refuse to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Legault says the amount of the penalty hasn’t been decided but will be “significant.”
More to come.
1:47 p.m. New Orleans will reinstitute an indoor mask mandate to fight the spread of COVID-19 while readying for an influx of visitors for the Mardi Gras season, the city health director said Tuesday.
Dr. Jennifer Avegno said the mandate takes effect Wednesday at 6 a.m. and will apply to participants in the annual Mardi Gras balls that take place in the city.
Avegno said Louisiana’s statewide coronavirus daily hospitalization numbers have grown in three weeks “by a factor of seven.” She said those cases have put a strain on hospitals, with emergency room waits as long as 12 hours in some facilities.
1:11 p.m. The province has distributed 1.9 million N95 masks for teachers and education staff in preparation for schools reopening next week, and there are plans to “regularly send new shipments over the coming weeks and months.”
“We have been preparing for the return of in-class learning on Monday, Jan. 17 by doing as much as we can to improve ventilation, provide high quality PPE and expand access to vaccinations,” Education Minister Stephen Lecce said in a written statement Tuesday, adding the province has also already shipped more than 4 million three-ply masks for students.
Lecce and Dr. Kieran Moore, the province’s chief medical officer of health, will hold a news conference Wednesday afternoon to discuss kids returning to schools.

12:50 p.m. Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott says the province is deploying internationally educated nurses , nursing students and other health care professionals into hospitals and long-term-care homes which need staffing support.
More than 1,200 applicants have expressed interest in participating in the program.
Elliott says 2,500 ICU beds are available and can add another 500.
Ontario Health’s Matt Anderson says there has been a reduced demand on the PCR testing network in recent days.
Elliott says there will be PCR tests available for staff and students who are symptomatic while in the school setting itself. Take home PCR tests will be limited.
12:10 p.m. Toronto Zoo will be holding a mass booster vaccination clinic. The initiative will add over 5,000 daily jabs to the province’s booster campaign.
Education and child care staff will be prioritized. Priority time slots will be made available to education and child care staff outside of school hours. A special booking link is available on fhvax.com for education and child care staff to access.
The clinic will start on Jan. 12 and run seven days a week. Appointments are required in advance and can be booked at fhvax.com
“Your Toronto Zoo plays a vital role in supporting our community, and one of the best ways we can do that right now is by offering our Zoo as a mass booster vaccination location” says Dolf DeJong, Chief Executive Officer of the Toronto Zoo, in a release.
11:55 a.m. Quebec is reporting 62 more deaths attributed to coronavirus, pushing the total number of people killed by COVID-19 in the province to 12,028, the most in Canada.
The new data comes a day after the province’s public health director, Dr. Horacio Arruda, submitted his resignation to Premier François Legault.
Legault is scheduled to hold a news conference in Montreal at 1 p.m. today, where he will be accompanied by Arruda’s temporary replacement, Dr. Luc Boileau, the head of a government health-care research institution called the Institut national d’excellence en santé et services sociaux.
The Health Department says COVID-19-related hospitalizations rose by 188, to 2,742, after 433 people were admitted to hospital in the past 24 hours and 245 were discharged.
11:22 a.m. New school guidance from the Ontario government says that only certain students and teachers who show symptoms of COVID-19 will have access to PCR tests when schools reopen to in-person learning next week.
The Ministry of Health document says take-home PCR self-collection kits will only be provided to elementary and secondary students as well as education staff who become symptomatic while at school.
The test kits will only be given to students or staff who have fever or chills, a cough, shortness of breath or a loss of taste or smell, or two or more of the less common symptoms such as a runny nose, sore throat or muscle aches.
The ministry says PCR kits will not be provided to entire cohorts or school populations.
The document says those waiting for the result of a COVID-19 test, or who cannot access a test, must isolate at home regardless of vaccination status, along with others in their household.
10:35 a.m. (updated) Ontario is reporting 3,220 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and 477 people in intensive care.
There are 250 patients on ventilators due to COVID-19; 21 new virus-related deaths were reported.
The province reported 7,951 new cases, but Public Health Ontario says the real number is likely higher due to the current testing policy.
Health Minister Christine Elliott says the province will now distinguish between people admitted to the hospital due to a COVID-19 infection and people admitted for other reasons with COVID-19.
9:45 a.m. Justin Trudeau says Canada will have enough COVID-19 vaccines for all those eligible to receive a fourth dose if needed.
The prime minister spoke with provincial and territorial leaders yesterday, and a statement issued by his office says he assured them Canada has secured enough shots for a third and potential fourth round of vaccinations.
The statement says Ottawa will do all it can to help provinces and territories cope with the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, as infections fuelled by the Omicron variant threaten to overwhelm health systems.
The federal government has said provinces and territories will receive a combined 140 million rapid tests this month, although the statement did not provide any new details on when the deliveries will be scheduled.
9:30 a.m. The Ontario government is expected to give an update Tuesday on the capacity of the province’s health-care system in the face of the fast-spreading Omicron variant of COVID-19.
Health Minister Christine Elliott is set to speak on the issue at 12:30 p.m., alongside the Matthew Anderson, the CEO of Ontario Health.
The province’s health-care system has been under growing strain in recent weeks due to the highly transmissible variant, which has also caused staffing shortages across several sectors.
The number of people in hospital with COVID-19 has skyrocketed, and there has been an overall surge in infections, even as the government limited access to testing to groups deemed more at risk.
Earlier this month, Premier Doug Ford invoked the potential for a “tsunami” of cases as he announced a temporary return to online learning for students.
9:20 a.m. According to the Ontario Hospital Association, Critical Care Services Ontario (CCSO) is now reporting at least 465 adult ICU patients with COVID-19 at provincial hospitals.
80 adults are newly admitted to intensive care with COVID-related critical illness, a single-day pandemic record for Ontario.
More people are now in Ontario ICUs with COVID-related critical illness than at the peak of the province’s deadliest second wave, around this time last year.
9:15 a.m. Between the deep freeze and the deluge of new COVID-19 cases connected to the Omicron variant, Mike Brown and his family thought it best to hunker down over the holidays.
There was a sense of relief on Dec. 30 when he heard his daughter would have a little more time before returning to her Grade 3 classroom after the Alberta government delayed reopening until Jan. 10.
The relief didn’t last long. This week, his daughter is back in school.
“I was hoping that there’d be some kind of a change ... Why was last week not OK for her to go back and this week is as if, in my view, nothing has changed?” said Brown, whose daughter attends King George School in Calgary.

8:55 a.m. Poland has become the latest European nation to reach the sad milestone of 100,000 deaths related to the coronavirus.
Nearly a quarter of those deaths — some 24,000 — occurred in the most recent wave of infection that began in October, a period in which vaccines have been widely available in the European Union nation of 38 million people.
Health Minister Adam Niedzielski said Tuesday that 493 more people with COVID-19 had died, pushing the overall pandemic death toll to 100,254 in the central European nation.
8:45 a.m. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson faced a wave of public and political outrage on Tuesday over allegations that he and his staff flouted coronavirus lockdown rules by holding a garden party in 2020 while Britons were barred by law from mingling outside the home.
Opposition politicians called for a police investigation after broadcaster ITV published a leaked email invitation to “socially distanced drinks” in the garden of the prime minister’s Downing Street office and residence in May 2020. The email from the prime minister’s private secretary, Martin Reynolds, was sent to dozens of people and urged attendees to “bring your own booze.”
The event was scheduled for May 20, 2020 — the same day the government at a televised news conference reminded people they could only meet up with one person outside their household. London’s Metropolitan Police force also published reminders about the rules that day.
8:20 a.m. The urgent care centre at Peel Memorial Centre for Integrated Health and Wellness will be closed for at least three weeks, to direct staff and physicians to sites where demand is greatest .
William Osler Health System announced on Sunday, Jan. 9 the hospital would be closed until at least the end of day on Monday, Jan. 10. On Monday night, Osler announced Peel Memorial would be closed until at least Feb. 1.
Osler explained the decision was made as a result of “increasing volumes in Osler’s emergency departments and patients who require admission for care, further compounded by extreme capacity and staffing pressures.”
8:10 a.m. Novak Djokovic held a practice session on Tuesday, a day after he left immigration detention, focusing on defending his Australian Open title even while he still faces the prospect of deportation because he’s not vaccinated against COVID-19.
The top-ranked tennis star hit the show courts of Melbourne Park, where the tournament is held, within hours of winning a legal battle that allowed him to stay in the country.
At issue is whether he has a valid exemption to rules requiring vaccination to enter Australia since he recently recovered from COVID-19. A judge ruled Monday he could stay, but the immigration minister could still send him home.
There were also new questions raised Tuesday over an immigration form, on which he said he had not traveled in the 14 days before his flight to Australia. The Monte Carlo-based athlete was seen in Spain and Serbia in that two-week period.
7:20 a.m. As COVID-19 hospitalizations in Ontario hit pandemic highs, hospitals are racing to care for an influx of patients sick with a wider variety of symptoms and conditions, making this surge different from previous waves and placing additional stresses on a system already struggling to cope.
While patients are still being admitted with plummeting oxygen levels requiring breathing support — the typical COVID presentation seen in prior waves — a broader range of patients with the virus are also needing care.
Hospital leaders report COVID is now sickening greater numbers of elderly patients, people who are immunocompromised, those considered medically fragile and patients for whom the virus has exacerbated an underlying medical condition, such as heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or insulin-dependent diabetes.

7:03 a.m. As Omicron sweeps through Ontario, it could take billions of dollars out of the province’s economy.
Economists say that’s the potential toll if 20 to 30 per cent of Ontario workers book off sick with the rapidly-spreading COVID-19 variant, as predicted by the province’s chief medical officer of health Dr. Kieran Moore.
“It’s certainly in the billions,” said David Macdonald, senior economist at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives.
While Moore’s prediction was meant to be across all sectors, some will fare worse than others when it comes to the economic impact from Omicron-related worker absences, Macdonald argued.

5:32 a.m.: Justin Trudeau says Ottawa will do all it can to help provinces and territories cope with the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, as infections fuelled by the Omicron variant threaten to overwhelm health systems.
The prime minister spoke with provincial and territorial leaders yesterday, and a statement issued by his office says he assured them that there are enough vaccine doses available for all eligible Canadians to receive third booster shots.
The federal government has said provinces and territories will receive a combined 140 million rapid tests this month, although the statement did not provide any new details on when the deliveries will be scheduled.
The statement says Trudeau also emphasized the need to promote support programs, such as the federal wage subsidy, to help people and businesses survive the latest lockdowns and public health restrictions.
The call with the First Ministers came as COVID-19 case numbers and hospitalizations continue to surge throughout Canada.
5:31 a.m.: A new poll suggests a slim majority of Canadians support the latest round of lockdowns and other government-imposed restrictions as the Omicron variant continue to fuel an explosion in new COVID-19 infections.
Fifty-six per cent of respondents in the poll conducted by Leger and the Association of Canadian Studies agreed governments are making the right decisions to limit the spread of Omicron and keep the health system from being overrun.
Another 31 per cent said they did not believe Omicron poses a serious health risk to most of those who are infected, and that governments should leave things open and let Canadians live with the risk.
The remaining 14 per cent said they did not know.
The results suggest there is a growing level of fatigue among Canadians when it comes to lockdowns, including among those who have been fully vaccinated, said Leger executive vice-president Christian Bourque.
5:31 a.m.: As Quebec officials consider tightening the rules for the unvaccinated, health experts in the province say expanding the vaccine passport system is justified because of the high number of COVID-19 patients in hospital who have refused to be jabbed.
Others, however, say the people who are rejecting COVID-19 vaccines are doing so out of ideology and likely won’t be swayed by the government’s latest restrictions.
Last week, Health Minister Christian Dubé said proof of vaccination will be required to shop at Quebec’s cannabis and liquor monopolies starting Jan. 18 and that the passport could be expanded further to include businesses such as shopping malls and personal care salons. Quebec’s College of Physicians on Friday said the vaccine passport should be required for places such as large department stores, libraries and museums.
Dubé has repeatedly said that about 10 per cent of Quebec adults are unvaccinated but represent about 50 per cent of COVID-19-related hospitalizations. But data published by the Health Department on Monday indicated that 32 per cent of the 4,094 people hospitalized with COVID-19 in the past 28 days had either been unvaccinated or were fewer than 14 days removed from their first dose.
Dr. Donald Vinh, an infectious disease specialist at McGill University Health Centre, said he supported an expanded vaccine passport system because it could encourage more people to get vaccinated. Any reduction in the number of COVID-19 patients in Quebec’s hospitals would help, he added.
5:29 a.m.: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson faced more allegations that he and his staff flouted coronavirus lockdown rules, this time by holding a garden party in 2020 while Britons were barred by law from mingling outside the home.
Opposition politicians called for a police investigation after broadcaster ITV published a leaked email invitation to “socially distanced drinks” in the garden of the prime minister’s Downing Street office and residence in May 2020. The email from the prime minister’s private secretary, Martin Reynolds, was sent to dozens of people and urged attendees to “bring your own booze.”
The event was scheduled for May 20, 2020 — the same day the government at a televised news conference reminded people they could only meet up with one person outside their household. London’s Metropolitan Police force published reminders about the rules on the same day.
During Britain’s first lockdown, which began in March 2020, gatherings were banned with a few exceptions, including work and funerals.
Johnson’s Conservative government has repeatedly been accused of flouting the rules it imposed on others.
5:29 a.m.: The head of the Serbian Orthodox Church Patriarch Porfirije has tested positive for COVID-19, the church said on Tuesday, amid a surge in infections in the country and elsewhere in the Balkan region.
Porfirije has developed “very mild symptoms of the virus infection” and remains in home isolation, said the statement. It added that Porfirije is carrying out administrative duties entirely without problems.
The 60-year-old patriarch became the head of the Serbian Orthodox Church after the previous patriarch, Irinej, died in November 2020 after contracting the coronavirus.
Porfirije on Sunday attended a mass ceremony in Republika Srpska, the Serb-run part of neighbouring Bosnia, where few people wore face masks.
5:28 a.m.: Poland has become the latest European nation to reach the grim milestone of 100,000 deaths related to the coronavirus.
Nearly a quarter of those deaths — some 24,000 — occurred in the most recent wave of infection that began in October, a period in which vaccines have been widely available in the European Union nation.
Health Minister Adam Niedzielski said early Tuesday that 493 deaths of people with COVID-19 had been registered in the past day, pushing the death toll to over 100,000.
The vast majority of the deaths are among people who have not been vaccinated. The vaccination rate in Poland is 55.8%.
Poland now joins Italy, the U.K, France and Germany as those European nations that have recorded 100,000 deaths.
Tuesday 5:26 a.m.: A third Chinese city has locked down its residents because of a COVID-19 outbreak, raising the number confined to their homes in China to about 20 million people.
It wasn’t clear how long the lockdown of Anyang city, home to 5.5 million, would last as a notice said it was being done to facilitate mass testing but did not indicate if it would end when the testing is completed.
Another 13 million people are locked down in the city of Xi’an and 1.1 million in Yuzhou.

Full text: A veteran Progressive Conservative MPP and former cabinet minister is quitting politics next month.
Jeff Yurek (Elgin-Middlesex-London) has announced he will not be running in the June 2 Ontario election, and is resigning his seat at the end of February.
"My time in public life has run its course. I believe it time for the voters of EML to select a new voice to represent their interests at Queen's Park," he said in a Facebook post Friday.
Demoted from cabinet last June by Premier Doug Ford, Yurek, who was first elected in 2011, had been minister of environment, transportation and natural resources since 2018.
"At the cabinet table I stood strong, being a persuasive voice for rural and southwestern Ontario," he said.
But Yurek was purged in a massive shuffle that saw the premier overhaul his cabinet late last spring over concerns that some rural ministers were "anti-lockdown" and encouraged him to reopen the economy too quickly during the COVID-19 pandemic's third wave last February.
"Those legacy MPPs (in cabinet) who are in safe seats, and have been anti-lockdown, were a big part of why the premier opened things too fast in February and closed things too slowly in April," a senior official confided last year before the cabinet changes.
On Twitter, Ford thanked Yurek "for his time and dedication in serving the people of Elgin-Middlesex-London."
"Congratulations Jeff on all that you accomplished during your 10 years as an MPP. Wishing you, your wife and daughter all the best as you enter the next chapter," the premier said.
No byelection will be called to fill the vacant seat as the general election is fewer than five months away.
Yurek is the latest MPP to announce he is retiring.
Other Tories who aren't running include Christina Mitas (Scarborough Centre), Gila Martow (Thornhill), Amy Fee (Kitchener South-Hespeler), Norm Miller (Parry Sound-Muskoka), Jim McDonnell (Stormount-Dundas-South Glengarry), and Randy Pettapiece (Perth-Wellington).
Liberal former premier Kathleen Wynne, who has represented Don Valley West since 2003, is not seeking re-election.
Neither are New Democrats Ian Arthur (Kingston and the Islands), Percy Hatfield (Windsor-Tecumseh) and Taras Natyshak (Essex).

Ford's inaction on child care is dangerous

Publication info: Toronto Star ; Toronto, Ont. [Toronto, Ont]. 11 Jan 2022: A.12.

Full text: The recent announcement that licensed child care would be kept open without access to PCR testing or reporting of outbreaks is, sadly, not shocking. But it is dangerous. So, too, are delayed and inadequate numbers of HEPA filters, N95 masks and rapid tests for staff and families.
But after nearly four years of disregard for child care, the Ford government's antipathy toward this crucial sector is no longer surprising.
Since their election in 2018, the Ford Conservatives have: cut millions of dollars in child-care funding; loosened child-care regulations; refused calls for pandemic pay; and failed to sign onto the federal child-care plan.
Child-care programs have been important supports for families through the pandemic and will be vital to our social and economic recovery. This is a penny that dropped for many people, including employers and governments all over the country, during the first waves of the pandemic.
But not the Ford government. It remains stubbornly stuck in the past, expecting the child-care sector and families to continue to do more with less, time and again.
It must take conscious effort on behalf of Premier Doug Ford to ignore the many calls for action on child care. Child-care advocates have now been joined by municipal leaders, chambers of commerce, employers and public health leaders in calling for increased attention to child care.
The child-care community has repeatedly alerted the province to the needs of families and educators. In May 2021, the "Forgotten on the Frontline" survey warned the provincial government of the impending workforce crisis that is now forcing programs to close rooms and limit enrolment.
The child-care community's "Road map to Universal Child Care in Ontario" has set a safe path forward. Municipalities have passed motions calling for the province to do more for our youngest. Public health leaders have warned of the risks of keeping child care programs open without necessary safeguards.
At this point it's clear the Ford government has an ideological allergy to properly funding and supporting child care. This puts them out of step with federal and local governments and a majority of Ontarians. And it's putting our children and those who care for them at risk.
In the face of this latest crisis, community leaders and opposition politicians have called on the province to immediately restore PCR testing and public reporting, ensure booster shot priority and an adequate supply of N95s, rapid tests and HEPA filters for child care. On Thursday, the province bowed to calls for vaccination priority for educators and promised additional N95s are on the way.
But it shouldn't require a community campaign to get basic health and safety standards only halfway right.
The provincial election is less than five months away. On June 2, Ontarians have the power to elect a government that doesn't treat the province's children, families and educators as an afterthought.

Full text: The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Wednesday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available.
6:16 p.m.: Ontario’s top doctor is stressing that COVID-19 vaccines for children aged five to 11 are safe and effective against the virus.
Dr. Kieran Moore made the clarifying statement on Wednesday, after saying earlier in the day that the vaccines are too new to require that children take them to attend school.
Those comments drew concern from opposition politicians who said Moore’s remarks might make parents more hesitant to get their kids vaccinated.
Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca called on Moore to clarify or resign from his position, while NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said she was also concerned by the comment.
Both parties have called for the province to add COVID-19 vaccination to the list of immunizations required to attend school in the province.
When asked Wednesday why the province has not done that, Moore responded that the province wants “greater experience” with the vaccine.
“It is a new vaccine and as a result of that we want greater experience with it before we ever mandate it,” he said. “I don’t think any jurisdiction in Canada has mandated the vaccine to date.”
His clarification, sent by email later in the day, stressed that the vaccine is safe.
“I want to be clear that the pediatric Pfizer vaccine for children five to 11 is safe, effective, and provides strong protection against COVID-19 and variants,” Moore’s statement said.
“To date, millions of children aged five to 11 have received the pediatric Pfizer vaccine and are benefitting from the strong protection provided, and the overwhelming majority of side-effects have been mild. I strongly encourage all children five to 11 to get the vaccine as soon as possible.”
Ontario kids in that age group became eligible for COVID-19 vaccines late last year. As of Wednesday, 47 per cent of five-to-11-year-olds had taken the first dose of vaccine and four per cent had received both shots.
6:07 p.m.: Federal Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos says Canada is in crisis when it comes to COVID-19 PCR testing capacity, as Ottawa struggles to make good on its promise to deliver 140 million rapid tests to provinces by the end of the month.
Access to PCR molecular testing, which is considered the gold standard when it comes to confirming a COVID-19 diagnosis, is in a crisis across the country, Duclos said Wednesday.
Many provinces have decided to restrict molecular PCR testing to individuals who are at a higher risk of being hospitalized from COVID-19 or are in settings where the virus could spread more quickly.
Duclos said that is why at-home rapid antigen tests have become a crucial tool in this fifth wave of the pandemic, which has been driven by the more transmissible Omicron variant.
5:07 p.m.: Peel Region is behind the provincial average in vaccinating children five to 11 — and community health professionals say it will take a concerted outreach effort to meet the goals.
The lower vaccination rate is more stark in lower-income neighbourhoods in the region, a trend that occurred in past waves.
That trend re-emerging indicates that health disparities, a mistrust of the health-care system that has harmed racialized and immigrant groups, and a lack of clear public health messaging is affecting whether residents are taking their kids to get vaccinated, community leaders told the Star.
With schools set to reopen this week, the need to vaccinate the youngest children eligible has become more urgent as the Omicron variant continues to drive case counts, increased hospitalizations and ICU admissions.
Read the full story here from Olivia Bowden.
5:00 p.m.: A confirmed COVID case in your child’s daycare could mean keeping your kid home for five to 10 days, while your entire household is required to self-isolate.
Or you might not have to keep them home at all.
It depends whether your kid’s daycare is following the new provincial guidelines, stricter rules set out by their local public health unit, or if they’ve decided to craft their own policies altogether.
“No one knows what’s going on,” said Amy O’Neil, executive director of Treetop Children’s Centre and chair of the Toronto Community for Better Child Care. “They’re putting it on (daycare) operators to figure this out.”
With the highly transmissible Omicron variant spreading wildly, child care excluded from publicly funded PCR tests and COVID cases no longer being tracked or reported in child-care settings, daycare operators in Ontario feel like they have been left to their own devices to safely manage outbreaks. Parents, meanwhile, are forced to sort through confusing policies and guidelines that seem to change by the day.

4:45 p.m.: The Manitoba government says it is shifting its focus slightly from trying to contain the spread of the COVID-19 Omicron variant.
Dr. Jazz Atwal, the deputy chief public health officer, says the variant is spreading widely and more of an emphasis will be placed on getting more vaccines into arms and other measures.
Premier Heather Stefanson says Manitoba has to learn to live with the virus, and vaccinations vastly reduce the risk of severe outcomes.
The province is seeing increasing numbers of patients in hospital and the number in intensive care, including non-COVID cases, is approaching capacity.
4:30 p.m.: The frenzied marketplace for COVID-19 supplies that defined the early days of the pandemic appears to have returned with Ottawa scrambling to find rapid tests.
Federal Procurement Minister Filomena Tassi said Wednesday while 140 million more tests are expected to be doled out this month, the hunt for more continues.
“We are doing absolutely everything we can to procure as many tests as possible,” she told reporters Wednesday as pressure continued to mount from the provinces to deliver more tests.
Tassi said the market is competitive, and a number of problems are making things worse.
“There are issues with respect to the supply chain, and those deal with issues of labour, issues of accessing raw materials, and also the cargo planes and getting transportation,” she said.

4:25 p.m.: Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health says the spread of the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus is creating the most serious challenge of the pandemic for the province’s health system.
Dr. Robert Strang said today between 500 and 700 health-care workers have been off the job in recent days because of the virus.
Strang says that’s created staff shortages across the system, from long-term care to emergency health services.
As a result, he says workers are either part of reduced health teams or have been redeployed to other areas of need in the system.
Charbel Daniel, executive director of provincial operations for Emergency Health Services, says the strain is also being felt by the province’s ambulance service.
Daniel says 60 of the service’s 1,200 staff members are off the job due to illness or exposure, which has resulted in delays in hospital admission and ambulance response times.
Officials say there are 60 people in hospital with the disease, including five patients in intensive care.
4:05 p.m.: Businesses that were ordered to close last month because of public health orders in British Columbia to limit the spread of the highly contagious COVID-19 Omicron variant can now apply for provincial relief grants of up to $10,000.
Economic Recovery Minister Ravi Kahlon says more than 3,000 operators could apply for the $10-million relief grant program, which provides between $1,000 and $10,000 to individual businesses.
Bars, nightclubs and lounges that do not serve full meals, as well as gyms, fitness centres and event venues, were among those ordered to temporarily close on Dec. 22, with a reopening date set for next Tuesday.
Kahlon says the grant can help businesses with expenses including rent, wages, maintenance, insurance and utilities.
He says the grant complements federal government programs that provide up to 75 per cent wage and rent support to businesses and $300 a week to eligible workers affected by public health orders.
But Kahlon says B.C. businesses that defied the health orders by staying open are not eligible to apply for the province’s grant.
3:51 p.m.: Health officials in Prince Edward Island are reporting 230 new cases of COVID-19 today.
They say there are 1,922 active infections on the Island.
There are seven people in hospital with the disease, including one in intensive care.
Officials are monitoring a number of outbreaks across the province, including at the Provincial Correctional Centre, where three inmates and three staff members have tested positive.
Anyone who experiences symptoms is encouraged to isolate until they can be tested.
About 92.4 per cent of Islanders aged 12 and over have received two doses of vaccine while more than 25,000 residents have received a booster shot.
3:40 p.m.: Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe says he will not impose additional measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 despite bracing for increased pressure to the province’s health-care system due to the Omicron variant.
During a COVID-19 briefing on Wednesday, Moe said “lockdown policies can cause harm in our communities often with little or virtually no benefit.”
He said he’s not criticizing other provinces, but noted Saskatchewan will take a different approach.
“(Lockdowns) cause economic harm by taking away jobs and removing family livelihoods. They have psychological harm by taking away social contact most particularly for our youth, and they’re an infringement on the rights and freedoms that we have come to enjoy and value as Canadians,” Moe said.
“That’s why they should be used only when necessary and if they can clearly be shown they are being effective and they are working, and we’re not seeing that as being the case today.”
Public health orders in Saskatchewan, which were to expire at the end of the month, were extended Wednesday to the end of February.
They include mandatory masking in all indoor public spaces, mandatory self-isolation for a positive COVID-19 test, and proof of vaccination or negative test to enter some venues and businesses.
Saskatchewan is the only jurisdiction in Canada without restrictions on gathering sizes.
Dr. Saqib Shahab, the province’s chief medical health officer, has advised people to stop gathering outside of work and school to curb the current wave of the pandemic and encouraged people to get vaccinated.
On Wednesday, the province reported a test positivity rate of 30 per cent and 121 people in hospital with COVID-19.
Cases are expected to rise, said Shahab, and so are hospitalizations.
He said it’s important to keep case numbers during the Omicron wave as low as possible, and one way to do that is to limit interprovincial travel.
“If we can keep it from coming to the province all at once, that’s going to relieve pressure on hospitalizations,” said Shahab.
“We have to sit and watch very closely and other mitigating measures still may be required.”
The Saskatchewan Health Authority plans to release a surge plan for hospitals on Thursday.
Moe said health-care workers getting sick with Omicron will add stress to hospitals, as well as the rise in cases. He expects up to 15 per cent of provincial health-care workers could get sick and be out of the workforce for at least five days to self-isolate.
“The sheer number is going to stress and challenge the services we provide in our communities and that includes education and the health-care sector,” Moe said.
2:49 p.m.: Florida reported 71,742 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday as hospital patients with COVID-19 increased to their highest level since Sept. 12, according to federal data.
On Tuesday, 11,386 patients in Florida hospitals had COVID-19, up 41.8% from the previous Tuesday, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The number includes patients admitted with the virus and those who tested positive while hospitalized.
The number of intensive care beds in Florida occupied by COVID-infected patients was 1,439 on Tuesday, a 60% increase from a week earlier.
Miami-Dade County still had the highest per capita rate of daily COVID-19 cases of any county in the U.S. on Tuesday — excluding counties with low populations — with a rolling seven-day average of 4,065 cases per 100,000 population. Broward County’s rate per 100,000 was 2,573 on Tuesday and Palm Beach County’s was 1,947. Overall, Florida ranks fifth-highest among states for average daily per capita cases.
The state’s seven-day moving average for daily cases increased to a record high of 65,660.
2 p.m. Businesses struggling under yet another round of lockdowns and capacity restrictions will have an extra year to repay emergency interest-free loans issued by the federal government.
The Canada Emergency Business Account offered interest-free loans of up to $60,000 to small businesses and not-for-profits.
When the government first created the CEBA program at the onset of the pandemic, it set a repayment deadline of Dec. 31, 2022, for anyone who wanted to take advantage of zero interest and having a portion of the loan forgiven.
But since then, some businesses have had only brief reprieves from the onslaught of COVID-19 and the restrictive public health measures that come with it.
1:45 p.m. The Ontario government is putting COVID-19 to the test in order to get two million schoolchildren back in classrooms next Monday.
Education Minister Stephen Lecce announced Wednesday that starting next week, millions of rapid antigen tests will be provided to teachers and staff in schools, child-care settings and children in daycare, as well as to students.
But families will only be notified by local public health units when absences at their schools hit 30 per cent — although that threshold includes all reasons for absenteeism, not just the highly contagious Omicron variant — given limits to lab-based COVID-19 testing the government previously enacted.

1:38 p.m.: Premier Jason Kenney says Alberta will not be following Quebec’s plan to impose a financial penalty on those who refuse to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
Kenney says the data shows the unvaccinated are proving to be a vastly greater burden on the hospital system than the vaccinated, but making them pay extra would not be fair.
He says the fee would violate the principle of universality of care in Canada’s health system.
He notes that it would be akin to making a smoker pay more for lung cancer treatment.
Kenney made the comments last night during a Facebook town hall meeting, which took written questions from Albertans.
1:30 p.m.: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says further details of Quebec’s proposed tax on unvaccinated residents will be “extremely important” to ensure it respects the legal requirements of public health care in Canada.
Speaking to reporters on Parliament Hill, Trudeau said Wednesday that the Quebec government has assured Ottawa the proposal — the first financial penalty for people who refuse COVID-19 vaccines in Canada — will not violate the federal Canada Health Act , which includes principles of universality and equal access.
But Trudeau repeatedly refused to say whether he agrees with the principle of taxing people who refuse to get their COVID shots, stating it is a “complex” issue and that his government needs more details about how Quebec’s proposal would work.
He also said provinces are “right” to be looking at different ways to motivate people to get vaccinated as cases of the Omicron variant skyrocket across the country and strain hospital capacity.
“We want to ensure the principles of the Canada Health Act are respected,” Trudeau said in French.

1:30 p.m. The 2022 PHF All-Star Showcase originally scheduled to be hosted in Toronto on Jan. 29 has been relocated to Buffalo as a result of restrictions in Ontario. The event will continue on the same date and feature this season’s new three-team format.
1:20 p.m.: When I go to vote this June in the Ontario election I’ll be greatly tempted to write in François Legault’s name on my ballot, writes Star columnist Bob Hepburn.
Yes, I know the Quebec premier won’t be running in the June 2 provincial election. Still, his decision this week to impose a “significant” tax on unvaxxed Quebec residents has my vote.
That’s because Legault is taking bold steps to get tough with people who still refuse to get jabbed against COVID-19 — unlike Ontario Premier Doug Ford and federal Conservative leader Erin O’Toole, who both continue to coddle anti-vaxxers.
Enough with trying to play nice! It’s time to crack down on the unvaccinated!
Legault deserves to be cheered by all of us who are fed up with politicians who think they can still sweet-talk the anti-vaxxers into getting their shots.

1:15 p.m.: Toronto Public Health is ready to fill any gaps in Ontario’s plan to get kids safely back into classrooms Monday — but as of Wednesday morning the agency had no firm details from the province on that plan .
Citing “media reports” that kids are returning to in-person learning after two weeks of online classes due to the surging Omicron variant, TPH chief Dr. Eileen de Villa told reporters the agency is prepared “to do what we can, and everything we can.”
But Toronto has got only “preliminary guidance” on provincial return-to-school protocols, she said, hoping for more information later Wednesday “so we can better articulate to the public what our role will look like on the ground.”
Ontario Education Minister Stephen Lecce and Ontario public health chief Dr. Kieran Moore were expected to reveal more back-to-class details at 1:30 p.m.
Full story here from David Rider.
1 p.m. Switzerland’s government is halving the self-isolation times required of people who test positive for the coronavirus and the quarantine times required of people they were in contact with, to five days.
The Federal Council, the seven-member executive branch of Swiss government, made the decision Wednesday and in a statement noted intensive-care admissions are lower in the pandemic since the emergence of the omicron variant worldwide over the last two months.
The decision to shorten the isolation and quarantine periods, from 10 days previously, results from shorter times between infection and transmission of omicron compared to earlier variants, the government said. The ability of Swiss regions to trace contacts has come under increased pressure as case counts, and thus people affected by isolation and quarantine, has risen sharply.
“The epidemiological situation is critical and remains difficult to assess: Hospital admissions and occupancy of intensive care units have fallen in recent weeks despite a surge in the number of cases,” the government said.
12:43 p.m. Ontario principals want a plan to address virus-related staff absences ahead of the planned return to in-person classes next week.
A statement today from groups representing principals and vice-principals in Ontario schools says they want learning to resume in-person on Monday.
But they say they want clear direction from the government about what to do when classes or schools need to close because too many staff are off work due to COVID-19 infections or exposures.
Premier Doug Ford said, when announcing the move to virtual learning on Jan. 3, that staff absences that would likely be driven by the highly infectious Omicron variant were a factor in the decision.
12:05 p.m. Spain’s medical community has scored a victory after a court ordered that a regional government must compensate doctors for having to work without personal protection suits during the devastating early months of the pandemic.
The lawsuit brought by a doctor’s union is the first of its kind to be won in Spain, whose health care system was pushed to the brink when COVID-19 first struck.
“This ruling is groundbreaking in Spain,” Dr. Víctor Pedrera, secretary general of the Doctors’ Union of Valencia CESM-CV that filed the suit, told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
11:45 a.m. Women’s shelter workers are feeling even more pressure as the latest COVID-19 wave hits Canada, fuelled by the highly transmissible Omicron variant.
Lise Martin, executive director of Women’s Shelters Canada, says shelters are overwhelmed in part because of significant staff turnover and shortages due to workers in COVID-19 isolation.
Martin says those in the sector were already working under pandemic-era strains, including a spike in demand for shelter and services along with rising rates of gender-based violence across the country.
Erin Griver, director of women’s services at Mission Services of Hamilton, Ont., says their women’s shelters have seen outbreaks and staff testing positive throughout the pandemic, but the current rates of infection moving through their sites have not been seen before.
11:25 a.m. Public health orders in Saskatchewan, which were set to expire at the end of the month, are being extended to the end of February.
They include mandatory masking in all indoor public spaces, mandatory self-isolation for a positive COVID-19 test and proof of vaccination or negative test to enter some venues and businesses.
Premier Scott Moe made the announcement Wednesday, but stopped short of bringing in measures around gathering sizes.
He says lockdown policies are an infringement on rights and freedoms. Saskatchewan is the only jurisdiction in Canada without restrictions on gathering sizes.
11:05 a.m. Toronto Mayor John Tory is holding a presser Wednesday morning .
He says more than 6.1 million doses have been administered in Toronto so far. Most doses being delivered are boosters or first shots for kids, but some Torontonians 12-plus still getting 1st and 2nd doses.
Tory notes the “very important scientific realities” that vaccinated people are less likely to get infected and less likely to get serious ill.
Toronto’s next big COVID-19 vaccine event is “Vax the Northwest” on Jan. 23 at York University’s Aviva Centre. The mega-clinic will offer first, second, third and kids’ vaccine doses.
Details on how to book an appointment at the Aviva Centre mega-clinic will be released “in the coming days, Tory says. Vax The Northwest aims to deliver over 1,000 COVID-19 vaccinations at the facility.
Tory says efforts are underway to get fourth vaccine doses to all residents of the city’s 10 seniors’ homes and working to get all staff at those homes their third doses.
10:45 a.m. The Toronto Zoo’s vaccination clinic opens Wednesday. Individuals need to book their appointments ahead of time and special time slots will be made available to education and child care staff.
Appointments can booked at fhvax.com .
10:22 a.m. (updated) Ontario is reporting 3,448 people in hospital with COVID-19, including 505 people in intensive care.
The province says 265 intensive care patients are on ventilators. There were 46 additional deaths reported due to the virus.
The province reported 9,783 new COVID-19 cases, though Public Health Ontario has noted that the total number is likely higher due to testing policy changes.
Provincial data show 82 per cent of Ontarians aged five and older have received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine and 87 per cent have at least one dose.
10:20 a.m. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson sought to head off a growing revolt within his own party, offering an apology for attending what he called a “work” event in the Downing Street garden during lockdown, when outside parties were illegal.
“There were things we simply did not get right,” he told the House of Commons on Wednesday. “I must take responsibility.”
The rare apology came after Johnson and his officials had spent days stonewalling after ITV reported that the premier’s senior adviser had invited about 100 people to a drinks party in the No. 10 garden in May 2020. Such gatherings were banned at the time as the U.K. battled the first wave of COVID-19 infections.
9:17 a.m. The Russia-based Kontinental Hockey League, a key source of players for Olympic teams, decided Wednesday to suspend its season for a week because of coronavirus outbreaks at many clubs.
The KHL said it will stop play from Saturday and resume on Jan. 22. The league said it knew of positive tests for 124 players around the league as of Tuesday morning, with 27 of those cases reported within the previous 24 hours.
The KHL website already listed 16 games rescheduled or canceled.
9:04 a.m. With just days to go until a deadline imposed by governments on both sides of the border, thousands of Canadian truckers still aren’t fully vaccinated against COVID-19 .
That shortfall risks throwing a supply chain already hammered by the global pandemic into even more chaos, industry experts say.
“Almost everything we buy will be affected somehow,” said Fraser Johnson, a business management professor at Western University’s Ivey Business School.

8:45 a.m. Relief — but also skepticism, concerns and questions.
News that Ontario schools will reopen Monday for in-person learning came with a mix of emotions for parents.
Mississauga mom Alexa Barkley said she’s “nervous” about sending her teens — 16, 15 and 13 — back to school given the overall surge in COVID-19 cases.
“I’m terrified — but at the same time, I do understand the benefits, especially from a mental health perspective, of the kids being with their friends” in school, said Barkley, a member of the Peel District School Board parent involvement committee.

8:27 a.m. Paris Saint-Germain called off its upcoming trip to the Persian Gulf region on Wednesday because of coronavirus concerns.
The French league leader was scheduled to fly to Qatar for a three-day training camp starting Sunday and then play a friendly match in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Jan. 19.
“In view of the health situation in France, Paris Saint-Germain has decided to postpone the Qatar Winter Tour 2022 to protect the health of its staff and players,” PSG said. The club is owned by the Qatari state.
7:10 a.m. As kids in Ontario prepare to return class next week, parents and experts worry about the effects remote learning has had over the past 18 months and what a future pivot back to online could mean for kids’ well-being.
“Our brains were not actually designed to work that way, to learn things through two-dimensional screens for hours on end,” said Marjorie Robb, psychiatrist at the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa.
Online learning can reduce kids’ attention spans, promote multi-tasking (which our brains aren’t designed to do) and create challenges with self-regulation, Robb said.

6:08 a.m.: Radiologists are warning that Canadian hospitals are in serious need of more equipment and staff to deal with medical imaging backlogs that the country was already facing before the COVID-19 pandemic began.
Dr. Gilles Soulez, president of the Canadian Association of Radiologists, said wait times for medical imaging that is critical for diagnoseswas already more than the recommended one month when the pandemic began in March 2020. On average, he said, Canadians were waiting 50 to 82 days for a CT scan and 89 days for an MRI.
Now with the COVID-19 Omicron variant threatening to overwhelm health-care systems again, many more of those appointments are either being delayed or cancelled, said Soulez, who is also a radiologist at the Centre Hospitalier Université de Montréal and a professor at the University of Montreal.
“Medical imaging is really at the cornerstone of any medical decision,” he said. “If you have any problems relating to cancer, you need to have the CT scan to identify the concern and plan your treatment.”
Early detection of many diseases is also key to a successful recovery and cure, he said.
6:07 a.m.: As a registered nurse and COVID-19 case investigator in Saskatchewan, Carolyn Strom says she is no longer allowed to reach out to schools.
During previous waves of the pandemic, it was her responsibility to contact-trace positive cases in students, pass along information to schools recommended by a local medical health officer, and deal with parents’ concerns and questions.
But as the province deals with record-high cases due to Omicron, that responsibility has now fallen to school principals and administrators.
“If your kid is positive, public health doesn’t get involved with collaborating with schools to make it safe anymore. It’s on the parents and it’s on the schools,” Strom said from her home in Prince Albert.
6:06 a.m.: With COVID-19 cases putting Canada’s hospitals at or near capacity, Quebec’s unprecedented plan to tax adult residents who refuse to be vaccinated is coming under fire.
The Canadian Civil Liberties Association says the tax plan is deeply troubling, noting the Charter of Rights and Freedoms recognizes individual autonomy over our bodies and medical decisions.
In an emailed statement Tuesday night, Cara Zwibel, acting general counsel for the association, says the tax penalty is a divisive measure that will end up punishing and alienating those who may be most in need of public health supports and services.
She says Quebec Premier François Legault’s government should abandon what she calls a “constitutionally vulnerable proposal.”
6:05 a.m.: Ontario’s education minister and top doctor are set to hold a press conference today on preparations for schools reopening.
The press conference comes after Premier Doug Ford’s office said Monday evening that schools will reopen on Jan. 17.
Ford previously pointed to the growing pressure on hospitals and a coming “tsunami” of COVID-19 cases when he announced the temporary shift to online learning on Jan. 3, which he had said would last until at least Jan. 17, depending on health indicators at the time.
On Tuesday, teachers unions and parents of school-aged children expressed safety concerns about the reopening plan since the government isn’t offering PCR tests for students and teachers unless they become symptomatic while at school.
A document from the Ministry of Health said those who develop symptoms at home are asked to isolate and not attend school.
6:04 a.m.: Germany’s president called Wednesday for a thorough debate over a plans for compulsory coronavirus vaccinations in the country, saying such a drastic measure needs to be comprehensively justified.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz has backed calls for a vaccine mandate and lawmakers are expected to begin debating a bill later this month. Polls show a majority of people in Germany back compulsory vaccination against COVID-19, but a vocal minority opposes the idea.
“The exceptional situation of a pandemic increases the pressure for the state to act, but it doesn’t replace the requirement to weigh up arguments and balance interests,” German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said ahead of a roundtable debate with citizens on the issue.
“A vaccine mandate means a debate mandate,” he added.
Steinmeier, whose role is largely ceremonial, said he wouldn’t take sides in the debate but urged those involved to have “respect for other positions, but also respect for facts and reason that must be and remain our common currency.”
6:03 a.m.: The Biden administration is increasing federal support for COVID-19 testing for schools in a bid to keep them open amid the omicron surge.
The White House announced Wednesday that the administration is making a dedicated stream of 5 million rapid tests and 5 million lab-based PCR tests available to schools starting this month to ease supply shortages and promote the safe reopening of schools. That’s on top of more than $10 billion devoted to school-based tests authorized in the COVID-19 relief law and about $130 billion earmarked in that law to keep kids in school.
The new initiative comes as the White House faces mounting criticism over long lines and supply shortages for testing and after the nation’s third-largest public school system, in Chicago, closed for days after an impasse between teachers and officials over reopening policies. The closure was a black eye for Biden, who made reopening schools — and keeping them open — a priority.
6:03 a.m.: The number of new coronavirus infections in the last week jumped by about 55%, although the number of deaths remained stable, the World Health Organization said in its latest pandemic report.
In the weekly report issued Tuesday night, the U.N. health agency said there were about 15 million new COVID-19 cases last week and more than 43,000 deaths. Every world region reported a rise in COVID-19 cases except for Africa, where officials saw an 11% drop.
Last week, WHO noted a pandemic record high of 9.5 million new infections in a single week, calling it a “tsunami” of disease.
6:02 a.m.: The northern Chinese city of Tianjin ordered a second round of COVID-19 testing on all 14 million residents Wednesday following the discovery of 97 cases of the omicron variant during initial screenings that began Sunday.
Residents were asked to remain where they are until the results of all the nucleic acid tests are received, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
Xinhua said authorities have carried out almost 12 million tests so far, with 7.8 million samples returned. Infections were first reported on Saturday in the city that is only about an hour from Beijing, which is to host the Winter Olympics from Feb. 4.
High-speed rail service and other forms of transportation between the cities have been suspended, leading to some disruptions in supply chains, including for packaged food items sold in convenience stores.
6:01 a.m.: Like millions of others in the most locked-down place on the planet, Melbourne resident Rav Thomas dutifully spent 262 days confined to his home as the COVID-19 pandemic raged. He got vaccinated.
And the single father of two found ways to pay the bills as Melbourne’s lockdowns — the longest imposed by any city in the world — battered his entertainment and events company.
Then in October, the city’s restrictions began to lift, along with Thomas’ spirits. His company once again began booking events as Melbourne’s nightclubs and bars reopened.
And then, omicron arrived.
The coronavirus variant has swept across Australia despite its high vaccination rate and strict border policies that kept the country largely sealed off from the world for almost two years.
Those measures, which turned Australia into a virtually COVID-19-free utopia early in the pandemic, have garnered fresh scrutiny as the government has battled to deport unvaccinated tennis star Novak Djokovic ahead of the Australian Open.
And they have prompted questions from frustrated and fatigued Australians about why their country — which seemingly did everything to stop the spread of the virus — now finds itself infested with it.
6 a.m.: West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday, his office announced.
Justice said in a statement he woke up with a cough and congestion, then developed a headache and high fever. The 70-year-old governor said he initially took a rapid test for the coronavirus, which came back negative.
The governor then was administered a PCR test that was positive. A test by a state laboratory confirmed the initial result and an additional test was being administered Tuesday night. Justice was experiencing moderate symptoms and was isolating at home, the Republican governor’s office said in a news release.
Wednesday 5:59 a.m.: When Chicago teachers went on strike last week to protest COVID-19 safety protections in the nation’s third-largest school district, Democratic Party officials leapt into action.
Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker pushed for a quick end to the job action and helped secure rapid tests to entice teachers back to work. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said the strikers “abandoned their posts” in “an illegal walkout,” and White House press secretary Jen Psaki stressed that students should be in school. The standoff ended with a tentative agreement late Monday.
Nearly two years into a pandemic that shows no signs of waning, Democrats are speaking out more forcefully against COVID-19 school closures, recognizing a rising anger among parents worried that their kids are falling behind. But in doing so, Democrats risk angering some teachers unions, which are advocating for more protections for educators amid a surge in the wildly contagious omicron variant and whose support helped get Democrats elected.
The political peril for Democrats became clear after their candidate lost the Virginia governor’s race in November to a Republican who focused on education and slammed the prior year’s school closures. Now, in what already promises to be a tough midterm election year, with frustrations mounting among their base over stalled voting and spending legislation, they may face real trouble over an issue that directly affects Americans’ lives.

Full text: Two weeks to make things right.
During Doug Ford’s last-minute news conference on Monday — which angered Ontarians seemingly as much as his disastrous one last April when he shut down playgrounds and gave police arbitrary powers — something Ontario’s medical officer of health said stuck with me. Dr. Kieran Moore said that the two-week switch to virtual learning should be enough time to implement safe measures in schools and get a handle on the situation.
Ontario schools were just on a two-week break though, and by early to mid-December warnings about Omicron’s wildfire spread were coming from all corners, including the province’s own science table. Were those two weeks off squandered?
Parents and everyone else have every right to remember this, and feel enraged and perplexed by it, especially since we’re coming up on two years of this pandemic and two years of the Ford government telling us everything is being done to make schools safe. We were told that during the break last summer, and the pandemic summer before that. And now we’re told two more weeks should be enough.
How many times can they say this?
It’s possible that Omicron could have foiled even the best-laid plans, but it’s obvious that there’s very little planning being done. This is symptomatic, albeit the biggest and most critical symptom yet, of how Ontario has treated its schools for a long time, even predating this particular provincial government.
Inadequate and not-yet-upgraded HVAC systems, crowded classrooms and the poor state of repair have been endemic to Ontario’s school system.
Walking around any Ontario city or town a few kinds of buildings are found in each one, over and over. Apart from the chain stores and banks there are places of worship, various government buildings and schools.
Public schools are one of our civic backbones and so many of them were built solidly, to last, as a statement that they and what they represent matter. This was the case pre-war but especially postwar, when Ontario was booming and growing quickly.
In Toronto, Cabbagetown’s Winchester Junior and Senior Public School is a showcase of both eras. The original school, facing Winchester Street, is a tall Victorian building with big windows, completed in 1898 and designed by Charles H. Bishop, an architect who designed dozens of handsome Toronto schools starting in the 1880s until about 1915. Many are still standing and well used.
His 1898 school building saw a 1959 addition added to the north, Prospect Street side. In a sleek, mid-century modern style it was designed by Peter Pennington , then the lead designer for the Toronto Board of Education. Pennington was involved in a number of designs during this burgeoning era, when the school board had in-house architects and there was a real determined effort to build well and beautifully for the future.
Some of his schools include the City Adult Learning Centre on The Danforth overlooking the Don Valley, the sharp and cool École Élémentaire Pierre-Elliott-Trudeau on Grace Street and Lord Lansdowne school on Spadina Crescent with its whimsical crown. Sadly, Pennington’s fine Davisville Junior Public School was allowed, like many, to deteriorate and wasn’t renovated to contemporary standards. It was razed a few years ago, replaced by a school of inferior design quality.
Recently, architecture critic Alex Bozikovic mounted an online exhibition called “New School ,” looking at modern architecture and public education in Toronto from 1943-1975 and exploring the roughly 300 school buildings in the city constructed throughout this era. “A tradition of quality” was a theme, but the exhibition ends on a pessimistic note, with the demolition of the Davisville school and the Toronto District School Board’s $3.7-billion repair backlog.
There are parallels here to the slow throttling of health care, public housing and other kinds of infrastructure, stories of great civic expansion being slowly squeezed and chipped away over time by successive governments. All buildings age and need repairs and renovations to keep up with current standards of accessibility and safety. Ventilation upgrades, especially with climate change (pandemic notwithstanding) are a critical part of this.
Yet so many schools were allowed to deteriorate and when big investments are made it is often to build new schools when old ones could have been upgraded. That’s a better value for taxes, and better for sustainability, avoiding waste. But building new is a political prize and renovations aren’t. Not maintaining buildings gives the impression they’re disposable.
That’s something to remember this year during the provincial and municipal elections. Of the latter, don’t forget the school board trustees who will want your vote, the most overlooked part of municipal voting. Ask them — ask all of them — about COVID-19 safety, about ventilation and class size, but ask if they’ll be champions of our still-excellent stock of older schools and the repair backlog to bring them up to current standards.
It’s all related to these two futile weeks we have to fix things. A week is already gone, but it’s already been several decades of wasted time.

Full text: The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Monday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available.
7 p.m.: Alberta’s chief medical officer of health says the more than 57,000 active cases of COVID-19 in the province are a tiny fraction of the true spread of the virus.
Dr. Deena Hinshaw says the actual number is likely to be about 10 times higher and pressure on the health-care system remains acute.
Alberta recorded more than 17,000 new cases over the last three days and has a 38 per cent positivity rate.
There are 635 people in hospital with the infection and 72 of them are in intensive care.
Hinshaw says cases brought on by the Omicron variant have swamped testing: people wanting a PCR lab test need to book days in advance and are waiting up to two days to get results back.
Hinshaw says only high-risk cases are now eligible for the tests, including continuing care residents and front-line health-care workers.
6:53 p.m.: The omicron COVID-19 variant continued to pummel New York state’s hospitals on Monday, but emerging data signal the strain is beginning to loosen its grip.
The statewide coronavirus test-positivity rate slid for the seventh straight day on Monday, dropping to a still-steep 19.4 per cent, as medical centers battled what could prove the roughest stretch of the winter omicron wave.
Hospitals across the state were treating more than 12,000 patients infected with COVID-19, according to figures released by Gov. Kathy Hochul’s office. And the statewide virus hospitalization tally, which climbed by 275 in the latest data batch, was almost 30 per cent higher Monday than its 2021 peak.
The state’s COVID-19 death toll rose by 135.
Dozens of upstate hospitals in high-risk regions were asked to freeze elective surgeries to spare bed space, the state Health Department said Saturday. The virus has also stretched staffing thin in medical centers.
6:35 p.m.: Long-term care homes accounted for nearly 70 per cent of deaths during the pandemic’s first wave in Quebec, but the risk was not prominent on the government’s radar as COVID-19 emerged in early 2020, a former assistant deputy minister of health told a coroner’s inquest Monday.
Pierre Lafleur, who was responsible for quality control and planning in the Health Department, testified that a letter sent to civil security coordinators of health-care facilities on Jan. 28, 2020, amounted to a “yellow” flag. Its message, he said, was effectively, “Something might happen, we have to get organized and here’s what we expect you to do.”
Lafleur told the inquest into deaths at long-term care homes led by coroner Géhane Kamel that the letter was nothing surprising, and its focus was not the care homes but health-care facilities in general.
Testifying before the inquiry last fall, Danielle McCann, who was health minister in the early months of the pandemic, pointed to the January letter as evidence that her government acted early and took exceptional steps to protect long-term care homes, known as CHSLDs in Quebec. She said the homes, where almost 4,000 people died between March and June 2020, had not been neglected.
6:07 p.m.: Hospitals around the U.S. are increasingly taking the extraordinary step of allowing nurses and other workers infected with the coronavirus to stay on the job if they have mild symptoms or none at all.
The move is a reaction to the severe hospital staffing shortages and crushing caseloads that the omicron variant is causing.
California health authorities announced over the weekend that hospital staff members who test positive but are symptom-free can continue working. Some hospitals in Rhode Island and Arizona have likewise told employees they can stay on the job if they have no symptoms or just mild ones.
The highly contagious omicron variant has sent new cases of COVID-19 exploding to over 700,000 a day in the U.S. on average, obliterating the record set a year ago. The number of Americans in the hospital with the virus is running at about 108,000, just short of the peak of 124,000 last January.
Many hospitals are not only swamped with cases but severely shorthanded because of so many employees out with COVID-19.
5:43 p.m.: The Ontario Hockey League has postponed five more games due to COVID-19 protocols affecting the Guelph Storm and North Bay Battalion.
Guelph’s games Monday at home against Owen Sound, Thursday at Windsor and Friday at home against Flint will be rescheduled at a later date.
North Bay’s games Thursday at home against Mississauga and Saturday at Barrie were also delayed.
The OHL has now postponed 49 games, all since Dec. 1, due to complications caused by the rapid spread of the COVID-19 Omicron variant.
The OHL has said it is committed to completing its 2021-22 season despite the challenges brought on by the pandemic.
The league cancelled its 2020-21 season due to COVID-19.
5:42 p.m. (Updated): Manitoba continued to see a climb in COVID-19 hospitalizations Monday as gathering limits remained in place and students started a week of remote learning.
Health officials reported 378 people in hospital with the virus — an increase of 81 from the last time data was publicly released on Friday. The number of those patients in intensive care grew slightly, to 38 from 34, and there were 19 additional deaths.
The province also announced thousands of new cases over the weekend.
Hospitals continued to operate at above-normal capacity. There were 93 total patients in intensive care, including people who did not have COVID-19. The normal capacity before the pandemic was 72.
To try to slow the spread, the Progressive Conservative government said last week that it would extend public health restrictions, including capacity limits in many indoor places, another three weeks to Feb. 1.
Schools were originally supposed to reopen this week after an extended holiday break, but the province moved classes to remote learning for most students to allow time for masks and rapid tests to be more widely distributed. In-person learning is to resume next Monday.
The Opposition New Democrats urged the province to give families one-time payments to help cover the cost of remote schooling.
“Perhaps a family has some challenges around needing access to a new (electronic) device or maybe you need a subscription for a learning technology,” NDP Leader Wab Kinew said.
The payments could be worth $500 per child, or $750 for special needs children, Kinew suggested. The cash would be available to any family regardless of income and would cost the province roughly $70 million, depending on uptake, he said.
“Whatever needs that your family has to get through this remote learning period and then back into the classroom, we think that it’s important for government to be there with some assistance.”
The Progressive Conservative government had earlier held out the possibility of continuing remote learning beyond this week, but Premier Heather Stefanson said Monday students will be back in class Jan. 17.
“We are going to stick to that. Kids will be back in school next Monday.”
5:29 p.m.: Connecticut has averaged more than 10,000 COVID-19 a day over the past week, state numbers show, by far the most of any time during the pandemic.
Nearly a quarter of the COVID-19 tests in the state came back positive over the weekend, continuing a coronavirus surge that shows no obvious signs of slowing.
COVID-19 hospitalizations statewide are fast approaching an all-time high, and some hospitals are already treating more coronavirus patients than they have at any previous point. Hartford HealthCare officials said Monday morning that their health system had 501 COVID-19 patients, compared to a high of 425 during Connecticut’s initial wave in spring 2020.
However, officials said Monday that fewer patients are requiring intensive care as compared to previous waves, likely due to protection from vaccines and the lesser severity of the omicron variant.
“At that time, when we had 425 (COVID-19) patients, about 128 patients were in the ICU,” Dr. Ajay Kumar, Hartford HealthCare’s chief clinical officer, said Monday. “Today we have almost 50 per cent or so, a little less than that, in the ICU.”
As of Monday, Connecticut ranked 10th nationally in new COVID-19 tests per capita and eighth in COVID-19 hospitalizations per capita, according to data aggregated by The New York Times.
Connecticut on Monday reported 31,405 new COVID-19 cases out of 132,606 tests since Friday, for a daily positivity rate of 23.7 per cent. The state’s seven-day positivity rate now stands at 23.6 per cent, the highest of any time since widespread testing began more than 18 months ago.
5:27 p.m.: Quebec reported 26 more COVID-19 deaths on Monday and a rise of 118 patients with the disease, as several Montreal-area hospitals moved to the highest level of service disruption to care for patients infected with the novel coronavirus.
Health officials said there were 2,554 people in hospital with COVID-19 — a new record — after 351 patients entered hospital in the past 24 hours and 233 people were discharged. The number of patients in intensive care, however, dropped by nine, for a total of 248.
Officials reported 10,573 new COVID-19 cases on Monday, although the government has limited testing to certain high-risk groups such as health-care workers, police officers and first responders. They said 20 per cent of tests came back positive. The test-positivity rate has been under 20 per cent for the last two days, after hitting more than 30 per cent last week.
Meanwhile, five more health regions were added to the highest level of service reduction, known as Level 4, Health Minister Christian Dubé said in an interview with 98.5 FM, confirming a report from Radio-Canada. The five regions all surrounded Montreal and included the Laurentians and Laval, Quebec’s third-largest city.
5:10 p.m.: Health experts and government critics are calling on the prime minister and premiers to fix cracks in Canada’s health system and improve surge capacity as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was speak with provincial and territorial leaders Monday afternoon to discuss the mounting health crisis posed by the Omicron variant of COVID-19. In a press conference Monday, Conservative ethics critic John Brassard said Canadians have been dealing with lockdowns and restrictions for two years while very little was done to address surge capacity in hospitals. Ontario Premier Doug Ford plans to raise the provinces’ plea for more federal health-care funds with the prime minister.
4:56 p.m.: Florida on Monday reported 125,996 coronavirus cases and 182 new deaths to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to Miami Herald calculations of CDC data. This is the largest multiday increase of newly reported cases since the pandemic began in March 2020.
Of these cases, the ones that were reported Saturday (77,156) also break the previous single-day case record, which was reported Thursday with 76,887 cases.
The CDC backlogs cases and deaths for Florida on Mondays and Thursdays, when multiple days in the past had their totals changed. In August, Florida began reporting cases and deaths by the “case date” and “death date” rather than the date or death the case were logged into the system.
Of the deaths added, all occurred in the past 28 days and about 69% occurred in the last two weeks, according to Herald calculations of CDC data.
In the past seven days, the state has added 38 deaths and 64,363 cases per day, on average, according to Herald calculations of CDC data. In all, Florida has recorded at least 4,759,073 confirmed COVID cases and 62,810 deaths.
4:50 p.m.: Yukon is handing out its first shipment of COVID-19 rapid tests from the federal government to people with symptoms who don’t meet the new requirements for PCR tests.
Yukon says in a statement the rapid spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 has created a growing demand and the PCR tests will be prioritized for those who are most at risk.
The free antigen tests will be handed out in Whitehorse, while the government said those outside the city or who are from vulnerable populations will be able to go for a test in community centres.
Vulnerable populations include the unvaccinated and those who have an underlying condition, are pregnant, living in long-term care or correctional centres, or who are over 50.
Acting chief medical health officer Dr. Catherine Elliott says even if the rapid test says people are negative, they should stay home and away from others if they are feeling unwell.
Yukon says it has 197 new COVID-19 cases, bringing active cases in the territory to 385, while 15 people have died since the pandemic began.
The territory says it has received 50,000 rapid home tests since the federal government announced last week it would be shipping 140 million tests to province and territories this month.
4:37 p.m.: The rampant spread of the Omicron variant has stoked alarm across the border, where the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a fresh Level 4 “avoid travel” advisory for Canada on Monday, citing a “very high” level of COVID-19 in the country and urging anyone who must go to be fully vaccinated.
That quickly prompted the State Department to revise its travel advisory, which had been at Level 3, “reconsider travel,” to upgrade its own advice to Level 4: “Do not travel to Canada due to COVID-19.”
4:31 p.m.: Aviran Yael fetched rapid antigen kits from a pharmacy in Tel Aviv’s busy centre, placed them in the light blue bag strapped to the back of his motorbike and headed off to deliver them.
With that, Yael on Monday joined a growing army of couriers toting Wolt delivery boxes around Israel, a sight that has become ubiquitous in the three years since the Finnish company began operating here.
The payload in the blue boxes changed when the Israeli government last week authorized more at-home testing to take the burden off of testing centres.
Almost immediately, as the omicron coronavirus variant set infection records, rapid antigen tests became the platform’s most in-demand product — even more than food, its core delivery business, officials said.
By Monday, as Wolt opened a modern headquarters in a blue building in Tel Aviv, someone was ordering an antigen test every three seconds — a reflection of widespread public anxiety and confusion over the government’s constantly changing pandemic policies.
“There’s real panic for these tests,” said Yael.
Even in relatively wealthy, small Israel, the government and the governed are struggling with the stunning surge of omicron as it rips around the globe, raising anxiety in a place already known for tension. Since the variant emerged in South Africa in November, the government has closed and reopened the airport, changed testing policies, tightened and loosened quarantine requirements and confused people about whether and how to send their kids to school.
In the latest twist, Foreign Minister Yair Lapid announced late Monday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, making him the most senior Israeli official to contract COVID-19.
“I am confirmed with corona,” he wrote on Twitter. “I feel excellent because I am vaccinated. Get vaccinated, wear a mask and we will ge through this together.”
With his government facing sagging public support, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett warned this week that between 2 million and 4 million people among Israel’s population of 9.4 million are expected to be infected by the variant.
On Monday, Israel reported 21,514 new cases, another all-time high. The number of serious cases crept up to 222, a figure that remains well below the highs experienced during previous waves of the coronavirus. Bennett has said preventing serious illness and hospitalizations is his main concern.
Testing has skyrocketed nationally, another sign of the concern about the variant’s spread. Coronavirus testing reached a peak for the current wave, with more than 342,141 PCR and antigen tests conducted Sunday, according to Health Ministry figures. That’s the second highest single-day figure behind a spike of more than 414,000 in late August, as Israel was rolling out its booster shots.
4:30 p.m.: Newfoundland and Labrador’s health minister says it was no fun to be infected with COVID-19 but that he’s feeling much better.
John Haggie announced on New Year’s Day he had contracted COVID-19 and was experiencing “regular cold symptoms.” On Monday, he said he was feeling much better and that he was not admitted to hospital.
“It’s one of those COVID-related experiences I could have done without,” Haggie told reporters in St. John’s. “It was quite a miserable time.”
Haggie was one of thousands of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians to become infected with COVID-19 over the holidays, and he said Monday that the demand for testing overwhelmed the province’s capacity to process all the swabs. Officials sent more than 6,635 tests to labs in Winnipeg and Toronto to be analyzed between Dec. 29 and Jan. 6, Haggie said.
So far, 680 have come back positive, and officials are waiting on results from another 2,930 tests, Haggie said. Those results are expected within the next two days.
In addition to the 680 positive cases found in outside labs, health officials reported 455 new cases since Sunday. The province also logged its 22nd and 23rd deaths due to COVID-19. As of Monday, there were 5,955 active reported cases in Newfoundland and Labrador, and four people were in hospital with the disease.
4:27 p.m.: Manitoba continued to see a climb in COVID-19 hospitalizations Monday as gathering limits remained in place and students started a week of remote learning.
Health officials reported 378 people in hospital with the virus — an increase of 81 from the last time data was publicly released on Friday. The number of those patients in intensive care grew slightly, to 38 from 34, and there were 19 additional deaths.
The province also announced thousands of new cases over the weekend.
Hospitals continued to operate at above-normal capacity. There were 93 total patients in intensive care, including people who did not have COVID-19. The normal capacity before the pandemic was 72.
To try to slow the spread, the Progressive Conservative government said last week that it would extend public health restrictions, including capacity limits in many indoor places, another three weeks to Feb. 1.
Schools were originally supposed to reopen this week after an extended holiday break, but the province moved classes to remote learning for most students to allow time for masks and rapid tests to be more widely distributed. In-person learning is to resume next Monday.
4:23 p.m.: The House of Commons ethics committee is expected to hold an emergency meeting later this week to investigate the Public Health Agency’s decision to collect data from millions of mobile phones to understand travel patterns during the COVID pandemic.
The Commons is still on its holiday break, but Conservative and Bloc Québécois MPs asked for the committee to have an emergency meeting after it emerged the agency is seeking to extend the data collection practice more than another 12 months.
The first contract to track the data expired in the fall. On Dec. 16, the Public Health Agency of Canada issued a new request for proposals to track nationwide cell tower-based location data between Jan. 1, 2019 and May 31, 2023.
The notice says the data must be accurate, accessible and timely as well as ensure privacy and transparency. It must be stripped of all identifying information.
Ethics committee chair Pat Kelly, a Calgary Conservative MP, told The Canadian Press he is “consulting members from all parties and will schedule a meeting for later this week” to look at the privacy implications of collecting cellphone tracking data.
4 p.m.: Hamilton GO train and bus riders will see a 15 per cent reduction in service starting Monday.
Metrolinx announced Jan. 6 that they are suffering a staffing shortage of about 20 to 30 per cent each day because of the highly contagious Omicron variant of COVID-19 and they expect that number to rise each day.
“This means there are fewer employees available to operate trains, to drive busses, to maintain and clean the vehicles, or to ensure adequate customer protection services are available when needed,” the release said.
Service affected by the reduction in service in the Hamilton area includes the Lakeshore West trains which go from Union Station to Niagara Falls and include the Hamilton and West Harbour stations.

3:49 p.m.: Starting Saturday, private health insurers will be required to cover up to eight home COVID-19 tests per month for people on their plans. The Biden administration announced the change Monday as it looks to lower costs and make testing for the virus more convenient amid rising frustrations.
Under the new policy, first detailed to the AP, Americans will be able to either purchase home testing kits for free under their insurance or submit receipts for the tests for reimbursement, up to the monthly per-person limit. A family of four, for instance, could be reimbursed for up to 32 tests per month. PCR tests and rapid tests ordered or administered by a health provider will continue to be fully covered by insurance with no limit.
President Joe Biden faced criticism over the holiday season for a shortage of at-home rapid tests as Americans travelled to see family amid the surge in cases from the more transmissible omicron variant. Now the administration is working to make COVID-19 home tests more accessible, both by increasing supply and bringing down costs.
Later this month, the federal government will launch a website to begin making 500 million at-home COVID-19 tests available via mail. The administration also is scaling up emergency rapid-testing sites in areas experiencing the greatest surges in cases.
The insurer-covered testing would dramatically reduce costs for many Americans, and the administration hopes that by easing a barrier to more regular at-home testing, it can help slow the spread of the virus, get kids back into school more quickly and help people gather safely.
3:44 p.m.: Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s office were invited to a drinks party in the Downing Street garden in May 2020, when such gatherings were banned in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an email seen by ITV News.
The message was sent to more than 100 Downing Street staff by the prime minister’s principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, and around 40 people ultimately attended the event on May 20, the ITV report said.
It follows claims from Johnson’s former top aide, Dominic Cummings, in a blog post Friday that he and a colleague had raised concerns at the time, warning it “seemed to be against the rules and should not happen.”
Johnson’s spokesman, Max Blain, declined to comment on the event when questioned by reporters at a regular briefing earlier Monday, including on whether Johnson and wife Carrie were in attendance. Bloomberg contacted Johnson’s office for its comment to ITV’s report, but there was no immediate response.
Senior civil servant Sue Gray is investigating a string of alleged parties held by Johnson’s office and other government departments in 2020, in apparent breach of coronavirus restrictions.
Angela Rayner, deputy leader of the main opposition Labour party, said in an emailed statement: “At the time this party took place, key workers on the front-line were working round the clock to keep us all safe, people suffered loneliness and loss in unimaginably tough circumstances and for the majority of the country our freedom was limited to a daily walk.”
3:43 p.m.: Retired Ontario educators will be allowed to work more days this school year as the province aims to address pandemic-related staff shortages before students return to in-class learning.
The government has not yet said whether students will return to classes in-person on Jan. 17 — the soonest they might see an end to the latest period of online learning, which began this month amid unprecedented levels of COVID-19 spread driven by the Omicron variant.
A written statement Monday from Education Minister Steven Lecce said the new agreement with the Ontario Teachers’ Federations that allows retirees to be re-employed for 95 days instead of 50 will help with the eventual return to in-person school.
“We need staff in order to continue providing live teacher-led remote learning and safely operate our schools when students return to in-person learning,” Lecce’s statement read. “That is why we have now secured an agreement with the Ontario Teachers’ Federation that will deliver access to thousands of teacher-qualified educators that will help keep schools open and safe.”
3:36 p.m.: Health officials in Prince Edward Island are reporting 320 new COVID-19 cases since Saturday’s update.
There are 1,517 active reported cases of COVID-19 on the Island.
Five people are hospitalized with the disease, including one in intensive care.
More than 95.7 per cent of Islanders aged 12 and older have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine and 92.4 per cent have received two.
Mass vaccination clinics are being held in Charlottetown and Summerside.
Officials say more than 25,000 people have received booster doses.
3 p.m.: Savannah Guthrie filmed the “Today” show remotely Monday after a positive COVID-19 test.
“We’re trading places,” Guthrie, 50, said to co-host Hoda Kotb. “I’m working from home. You’re back in the studio. You have a negative test for COVID. I just tested positive for COVID, so here we go.”
Guthrie’s breakthrough case comes after Kotb’s similar breakthrough case.
“I know that your negative test will come quickly but here’s to happy healing,” Kotb, who tested positive on Thursday, but tested negative twice since then, replied.
Guthrie retweeted a video of her exchange with Kotb and declared she was “feeling fine” and would return to the studio soon.
On the air, Guthrie said her symptoms were mild (”Little sniffles, not much more than that”).
Guthrie is fully vaccinated, and boosted. She received her first vaccine dose for a segment on “Today” in 2021.
2:50 p.m.: An Omicron-specific booster shot could be ready by the fall, Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said Monday.
The pharmaceutical company is currently working on a targeted shot for the newest COVID-19 variant, Bancel announced. The booster is about to enter clinical trials.
On CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” Bancel said the shot could in pharmacies and arms as early as the fall.
“We need to be careful to try to stay ahead of a virus and not behind the virus,” she said.
The current Moderna booster shot, a half dose, increases neutralizing antibody levels against Omicron 37-fold over the second shot. A full dose increases effectiveness 100-fold.
Omicron is believed to be more transmissible than the previous Delta variant and the skyrocketing cases have shut down hospitals, schools and other businesses. But, as opposed to Delta, the availability of the vaccine has meant that infections are causing less severe symptoms or presenting as asymptomatic altogether.
Moderna has already signed advanced purchase agreements worth $18.5 billion with the United Kingdom, South Korea, Switzerland for shots as soon as they’re available.
2:30 p.m.: BC Ferries says a combination of the fast-spreading Omicron COVID-19 variant, a global shortage of mariners, severe weather and the flu season has the potential to disrupt ferry service over the next few months.
The company says in a statement that the problem may hit interisland routes hardest.
It says crewing regulations require that positions on ferries be filled with the appropriate crew or a vessel can’t sail.
Even if a small number of crew don’t show up, it says finding replacements can be difficult.
BC Ferries says it has a pool of staff in reserve and cross-trains crew members, but there will be times when the company will have to change its service.
It says no schedule is expected to be suspended completely, but routes may be operated on a modified schedule.
2:10 p.m.: Children in Alberta and British Columbia returned to the classroom on Monday, as surging COVID-19 cases threatened to overwhelm hospitals in several parts of Canada.
Quebec reported an all-time high of 2,554 patients in hospital with COVID-19, a rise of 118 from the previous day’s record of 2,436. Intensive care cases ticked down by nine for a total of 248.
The province also reported 10,573 new COVID-19 infections, while 26 more people died from the disease.
Quebec also opened up appointments for third doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to those aged 40 and older on Monday, as the province prepares to expand eligibility to all adults aged 18 and up next week.
In Ontario, there were 2,467 people hospitalized with COVID-19, including 438 patients in intensive care, Health Minister Christine Elliott said on Monday, noting that not all hospitals report data from the weekend.
The province reported 9,706 new COVID-19 cases, but Public Health Ontario has qualified that this may be an undercount because of a policy making tests less accessible. There were 12 more virus-related deaths, provincial officials said.
Quebec and Ontario are among the provinces that have delayed the return to in-person schooling as part of renewed efforts to curb the rampant spread of the Omicron variant across the country.
But the two westernmost provinces moved ahead with reopening classrooms on Monday, with officials arguing virtual learning presents its own risks to youth mental health.
While some parents in Alberta are relieved that students in Grades K-12 are returning to classes after an extended holiday break, many said they were concerned and frustrated about unclear instructions from the provincial government on how it plans to contain the spread of COVID-19 in classrooms.
Alberta Education Minister Adriana LaGrange has promised thousands of test kits will be delivered to students and parents in that province over the next few days.
However, Edmonton Public Schools and the Alberta Teachers’ Association have said there are still kids who won’t get them until days after they return to classes, which could further exacerbate the surge of Omicron cases.
British Columbia’s top doctor has said that Monday’s return to school is “essential” for the emotional, physical and intellectual well-being of children, while reassuring parents that safety measures have been put in place to mitigate the risks posed by Omicron.
Dr. Bonnie Henry acknowledged on Friday that some families may feel uneasy about the move, but maintained that students are safer in the classroom than in some of the “unstructured settings that children are in outside of the school environment.”
Also starting immediately, staff at National Microbiology Laboratory facilities across the country are being asked to work from home if possible.
A statement from the Public Health Agency of Canada said the move is aimed at protecting essential workers doing critical on-site diagnostic and lab research.
The work from home order covers staff at the lab sites in Winnipeg, Guelph, Ont., Saint-Hyacinthe, Que. and Lethbridge, Alta.
2 p.m. A few members of the Canadian Armed Forces are arriving to Bearskin Lake First Nation in northern Ontario to assist the community amid a COVID-19 outbreak that has infected half of its population.
A spokeswoman for federal Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair says four Rangers are there to co-ordinate, help with logistics, and distribute food water, firewood and care packages.
Annie Cullinan says more Rangers will be deployed in the community during the coming days. The community has requested the assistance of 40 personnel.
Chief Lefty Kamenawatamin, who tested positive Saturday for COVID-19 and is in isolation, says the community needs more support quickly.
1:46 p.m.: Newfoundland and Labrador health officials are reporting another 1,135 new cases of COVID-19 .
They said today in a news release that 455 new cases were identified since Sunday’s update and 680 new cases were identified by labs outside the province over the past two weeks.
Officials say provincial testing capacity was overrun by a recent surge in cases and tests were sent to out-of-province labs between Dec. 29 and Jan. 6 to deal with the backlog.
The Health Department did not specify how many tests were sent to labs outside the province, only that 680 came back positive.
Officials are reporting two more COVID-19-related deaths and say there are 5,955 active cases and four people in hospital with the disease.
The government said today it would introduce new rules in March limiting protests around schools and health-care facilities, in response to a small demonstration over the weekend at a COVID-19 booster clinic in St. John’s.
1:45 p.m. Israel is struggling with the stunning surge of Omicron as it rips around the globe, raising anxiety in a place already known for tension. Since the variant emerged in South Africa in November, the government has closed and reopened the airport, changed testing policies, tightened and loosened quarantine requirements and confused people about whether and how to send their kids to school.
Facing sagging public support, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett warned this week that between 2 million and 4 million people among Israel’s population of 9.4 million are expected to be infected by the variant.
On Monday, Israel reported 21,514 new cases, another all-time high. The number of serious cases crept up to 222, a figure that remains well below the highs experienced during previous waves of the coronavirus. Bennett has said preventing serious illness and hospitalizations is his main concern.
1:30 p.m. Maj.-Gen. Dany Fortin’s appeal to get his job back as head of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout will go ahead after a judge adjourned the federal government’s request to throw it out.
In a decision delivered Friday, Federal Court of Appeal Justice Anne Mactavish ruled that Ottawa’s request to quash Fortin’s appeal should be left up to the panel of judges that will hear the appeal.
Fortin’s lawyers expect the appeal to be heard sometime in the spring.

12:30 p.m. Health experts and government critics are calling on the prime minister and premiers to fix cracks in Canada’s health system and improve surge capacity as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will meet with provincial and territorial leaders Monday afternoon to discuss the mounting health crisis posed by the Omicron variant of COVID-19.
Conservative ethics critic John Brassard says the federal and provincial governments didn’t secure the surge capacity needed to cope with the record number of COVID-19 cases this year.
The federal government plans to negotiate with provinces on health transfers once the pandemic has ended, but several health-care experts argue those conversations should happen now.
12:15 p.m. The NHL Players’ Association has filed a grievance against the San Jose Sharks for terminating the remainder of Evander Kane’s contract, a person with direct knowledge of the decision told The Associated Press on Monday.
The grievance, contending the Sharks did not have sufficient grounds to make the move, was filed Sunday night, the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the matter is now in the league’s hands.
The Sharks placed Kane on unconditional waivers on Saturday, saying the forward violated COVID-19 protocols while with the AHL Barracuda. Kane went unclaimed over the 24-hour period, putting the Sharks in position to terminate the remainder of the player’s contract.
The move will cost Kane about $22.9 million from the seven-year, $49 million deal he signed in May 2018.
Kane is now a free agent and open to sign with any team, while awaiting the start of the grievance process.
11:45 a.m. Quebec is reporting 26 more deaths attributed to coronavirus Monday and a rise of 118 COVID-19-related hospitalizations.
Health officials say there are 2,554 people in hospital with COVID-19 — a new record — after 351 patients entered hospital in the past 24 hours and 233 people were discharged.
The number of patients in intensive care dropped by nine, however, for a total of 248.
Officials are reporting 10,573 new COVID-19 cases today and say just under 20 per cent of tests came back positive. The test-positivity rate has been under 20 per cent for the last two days, after hitting more than 30 per cent last week.
11:30 a.m. As the COVID-19 case count in Canada surges due to the Omicron variant, the number of people dealing with long-term symptoms — an expansive list that can include brain fog, fatigue, muscle aches — will grow.
Palliative care physician Dr. Amit Arya sees this easily snowballing to be a “mass disabling event.”
The GTA physician is one of several health-care professionals who have been speaking out about how ineffective government action will likely increase the number of people living with disabilities. And more than that, how leaders have overlooked the existing disabled community altogether.

10:17 a.m. (updated) Ontario is reporting 438 people in intensive care with COVID-19 and 2,467 people hospitalized with the virus.
Health Minister Christine Elliott shared the figures noting that not all hospitals report data from the weekend.
The province reported 9,706 new COVID-19 cases, but Public Health Ontario has noted that the actual number of cases is likely higher due to a policy making tests less accessible.
There were 12 new virus deaths reported.
Provincial data says 81 per cent of Ontarians aged five and older have received two COVID-19 vaccine doses and 87 per cent have at least one shot.
The numbers come as Metrolinx, the Crown corporation that runs GO Transit, reported staffing levels reduced by 20 to 30 per cent due to the Omicron variant’s spread, reducing transit options for commuters.
10 a.m. More than a third of Baltimore City schools will switch to online learning Monday after test results that came in over the weekend showing thousands of students and staff may have COVID-19.
The school system listed 57 schools transitioning temporarily to online learning on its website Sunday evening. Two other schools were closed for what was described as facilities challenges. The city has 155 schools.
Baltimore City Public Schools spokesman Andre Riley said Sunday that those schools closed by positive pool tests will remain virtual all week and return Jan. 19.
9:50 a.m. A Quebec coroner’s inquest into deaths in long-term-care homes during the pandemic’s first wave enters its final stage today, resuming after a month-long pause.
Almost 4,000 people died in the homes, known in Quebec as CHSLDs, between February and June 2020, accounting for nearly 70 per cent of the deaths reported in the province during the first wave.
The provincial coroner’s office called for an inquest examining the deaths of elderly and vulnerable people in seven residential settings during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the government response to the outbreaks.
Hearings are resuming this week with testimony from two Health Department officials and Seniors Minister Marguerite Blais.
9:32 a.m. Nearly 600 vaccination appointments remain available Monday for all eligible residents 12 or older at the city-run clinic at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre. Those appointments can be booked through the provincial booking system.
The following clinic locations are operating Monday:
Metro Toronto Convention Centre: 255 Front St. W., Lower Level, Constitution Hall Rooms 105, 106 and 107 (entrance through the John W.H. Bassett Theatre on Front Street; accessible entrance to the west of the Second Cup doors)
Cloverdale Mall: 250 The East Mall (north end of mall (in the former Target store; enter the clinic via the exterior entrance only)
Scarborough Town Centre: 300 Borough Dr. (east side of the centre on the upper level, near Entrance 2; enter the clinic via the mall exterior)
Mitchell Field Community Centre: 89 Church Ave. (east side of the building in the gym; enter through the Community Centre main entrance)
Woodbine Mall: 500 Rexdale Blvd. (inside the Hudson’s Bay store; enter through the entrance on the second level)
8:03 a.m. Novak Djokovic won a court battle Monday to stay in Australia to contest the Australian Open after his exemption from strict COVID-19 vaccination rules was questioned, but the drama might not be finished, with the government threatening to cancel the tennis star’s visa a second time and deport him.
Federal Circuit Court Judge Anthony Kelly reinstated Djokovic’s visa, which was revoked after his arrival last week because officials decided he didn’t meet the criteria for an exemption to an entry requirement that all non-citizens be fully vaccinated. Djokovic’s lawyers say that since he recently recovered from an infection, he didn’t need to be inoculated under Australia’s rules.
The judge ruled the No. 1 player had not been given enough time to speak to his lawyers before the decision about his visa was made and ordered the government to release him within 30 minutes from a Melbourne quarantine hotel where he has spent the last four nights.
7:50 a.m. The union representing Toronto’s paramedic services sent an alarming tweet Saturday: “ #CodeRed No units available in the city at 18:38 hours tonight.”
The tweet stoked fears the health-care system was once again feeling the strain of COVID-19, fuelled by the fast-spreading Omicron variant.
And, while a union representative told the Star the staffing issues are nothing new, resources are stretched thin by the pandemic and an ongoing opioid overdose crisis.

7:35 a.m. Winter term in Ontario is beginning for most university and college students on Jan. 10, with many schools starting the semester online as the highly contagious Omicron variant has ripped through the province.
But several universities have told students they are expecting them to return to campus for in-person classes by the end of the month, fuelling uncertainty and anxiety for some given the COVID-19 surge that has increased hospitalizations in major city centres.
Others who have been cooped up with family during the holidays face the pressure to return to student housing, all while navigating the transmissibility of the Omicron variant and living with multiple roommates.

5:48 a.m.: Quebecers aged 40 and over can now book appointments for a third dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.
More people became eligible today to register for the booster shot as the province battles a surge in hospitalizations due to the highly infectious Omicron variant.
The province has recently been reporting more than 2,000 daily hospitalizations for the first time since the start of the pandemic, setting an all-time high record of 2,436 patients on Sunday.
Health Minister Christian Dubé said last week the province’s vaccine passport will soon be required to show proof of three doses in order to be admissible.
All adults 18 and over will be able to book a booster shot appointment as of Jan. 17, a few days earlier than originally planned.
Residents 45 and older can already access their third dose, as can pregnant women, health-care workers and other select groups.
5:48 a.m.: COVID-19 cases are threatening to overwhelm hospitals in several parts of Canada, with hospitalizations nearing or reaching record highs in Quebec, Ontario, and New Brunswick.
Former CEO of the University Health Network and Ontario deputy health minister Dr. Bob Bell says every Western country dealing with COVID’s fast spreading Omicron variant has a stressed hospital system right now. But he says Canada will pursue lockdowns and restrictions sooner than places such as the United States because it has a lower tolerance for measures like death.
Meanwhile, despite the concerns of both parents and children over surging COVID cases, students in Alberta are headed back to class today.
Education Minister Adriana LaGrange has promised thousands of test kits will be delivered to students and parents over the next few days. However, Edmonton Public Schools and the Alberta Teachers’ Association have said there are still kids who won’t get them until days after they return to classes, which could further exacerbate the lightning spread of Omicron cases.
5:47 a.m.: While some parents are relieved that students in Grades K-12 are returning to classes after an extended holiday break, many say they are concerned and frustrated about unclear instructions from the Alberta government on how it plans to contain a surge in COVID-19 infections in classrooms caused by the Omicron variant.
The province had almost a 40 per cent positivity rate last week. Education Minister Adriana LaGrange has promised thousands of test kits will be delivered to students and parents over the next few days, but has left it up to schools to report and track infections.
Dr. Deena Hinshaw, chief medical officer of health, has said a return to in-person learning is critical and necessary for students’ mental wellness.
“We know the COVID infection has a low — but not zero — risk for children. We also know in-person learning is critically important for many kids’ educational and social development and provides a sense of stability and normalcy in these challenging times,” she said last week.
Schools have received their masks and test kits, but Edmonton Public Schools and the Alberta Teachers’ Association have said there are still kids who won’t get them until days after they return to classes, which could exacerbate the spread of the already highly contagious variant.
5:46 a.m.: Some southern Ontario commuters will find themselves with fewer options today as transit agency Metrolinx cuts back on service due to COVID-19.
The Crown corporation that operates GO Transit says staffing levels are 20 to 30 per cent lower on average due to the rapid spread of COVID’s Omicron variant.
It says absenteeism is expected to increase as more people are exposed to Omicron, so the agency is acting now in an effort to “protect critical transit services.”
Metrolinx says it’s decreasing service by about 15 per cent across the network.
The agency adds that it’s hoping to maintain “hourly service or better” wherever possible.
It also says it expects ridership to remain low, as many people are working and attending school remotely.
5:45 a.m.: Healthcare and front-line workers along with people above age 60 with health problems lined up Monday at vaccination centres across India to receive a third dose as infections linked to the omicron variant surge.
The doses, which India is calling a “precautionary” shot instead of a booster, were given as new confirmed coronavirus infections rocketed to over 179,000 on Monday, nearly an eightfold increase in a week. Hospitalizations, while still relatively low, are also beginning to rise in large, crowded cities such as New Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata.
Dr. Ravindra Kumar Dewan, who heads the National Institute of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases in New Delhi, queued up for his shot. He said boosters are a “significant step” because there are still many unknowns about the omicron variant.
“Yesterday, the mortality ... has increased in Delhi. So, whether our health care system will get overwhelmed or not is yet to be seen,” he said.
India is better prepared now than it was last year when the Delta variant overwhelmed hospitals. When cases spiked in March last year, not even 1% of its population of nearly 1.4 billion was fully vaccinated. India’s creaky medical infrastructure meant millions likely died.
5:44 a.m.: The numbers are small, but the major port of Tianjin may be facing China’s first local outbreak of omicron of any size, less than a month before the Winter Olympics open in nearby Beijing.
State broadcaster CCTV said the government has divided Tianjin and its 14 million residents into three levels of restrictions, starting with lockdown areas where people are not allowed to leave their homes at all. In control areas, each household is allowed to have one family member leave to buy groceries every other day, while in prevention areas, people must remain inside their immediate neighbourhoods.
Buses and trains from Tianjin to Beijing have been suspended and people are being told not to leave the city unless they have pressing business.
The city began mass testing of all its residents on Sunday after a cluster of 20 children and adults tested positive for COVID-19, including at least two with the omicron variant. Another 20 people tested positive on Sunday, bringing the total to 40. Officials said earlier that the virus has been circulating so the number of cases could rise.
Monday 5:42 a.m.: Heading into a critical midterm election year, the top political concerns of Americans are shifting in ways that suggest Democrats face considerable challenges to maintaining their control of Congress.
A poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that management of the pandemic, once an issue that strongly favoured President Joe Biden and his fellow Democrats, is beginning to recede in the minds of Americans. COVID-19 is increasingly overshadowed by concerns about the economy and personal finances — particularly inflation — which are topics that could lift Republicans.
Just 37% of Americans name the virus as one of their top five priorities for the government to work on in 2022, compared with 53% who said it was a leading priority at the same time a year ago. The economy outpaced the pandemic in the open-ended question, with 68% of respondents mentioning it in some way as a top 2022 concern. A similar percentage said the same last year, but mentions of inflation are much higher now: 14% this year, compared with less than 1% last year.

Full text: Daycare workers need PCR testing and N95 masks
Ontario faces clampdown, Jan. 4
I have a four-year-old son in JK and a two-year-old daughter who attends licensed daycare. I understand the decision to close schools temporarily to allow our health-care system to manage. As a social worker, I witness first-hand the fragility of our health-care system and how vulnerable it is now.
I am concerned about the unfair treatment of our early childhood educators, who are on the front line daily, supporting our youngest children, in one of the least safe set of circumstances. They provide essential daycare that we rely on as front-line health-care workers. Without them, we cannot continue to work.
All children in licensed child care centres require access to PCR testing. These children are not able to use masking and social distancing measures the same way older children can. Staff at the daycare must also have access to PCR testing. Without it, several staff may need to self-isolate at once.
N 95 masks have been promised, not delivered. Staff need personal protective equipment to provide care safely.
Let's start to treat our daycare providers as essential and provide them with the testing and equipment required to keep them safe.

City golf courses should be put
to better use
Will Toronto tee up changes to city-run golf courses? Jan. 7
In normal times, I would fully support the continued use of these courses as an affordable way for people to enjoy the game of golf. I love the sport, along with the health benefits it provides.
But these are not normal times. Poverty and homelessness are everywhere and inequality just keeps getting worse. When will this city start putting the needs of the poor ahead of those of the middle class? When will they put doing what is moral and right ahead of their re-election prospects?
As we all know, the marginalized seldom vote.
Susan Jeffries, Toronto
Why not use hydro corridors for urban farms?
Jennifer Pagliaro reports that some of Toronto's golf courses could be turned into urban farms. The article refers to several recommendations, but I do not see any mention of Toronto or Ontario Hydro corridors. They are widespread and could easily be used for the purpose of urban farming.
Before the city decides to make any move to convert golf courses or park lands into vegetable gardens they should seriously consider these spaces.
Perhaps they have and have received resistance from the utilities. If so, the utilities need to be reminded that the land is owned by us, Ontario residents, and that with the climate change impacting everything, the day will come when we need arable land to grow food.
Harry Coupland, Etobicoke
Ham-fisted
halt to surgeries affects Shouldice
Here's another fine example of how our provincial government is mishandling the COVID response. They have directed the Shouldice Hospital - a medical facility world famous for hernia repair operations - to cancel and postpone all of its scheduled surgeries.
Shouldice has no emergency wing, no triage, no ICU, and no service for either COVID patients or for general medical issues. They are specialists in one specific area of medicine, and they had developed and implemented their own safety protocols to address the COVID issue at their one-of-a-kind facility.
Thanks to our ham-fisted government, my scheduled surgery, and those of dozens of other hernia patients, are not only cancelled but are postponed indefinitely.
All because the Doug Ford government is incapable of formulating any kind of plan beyond "one size fits all" to cope with this pandemic.

Full text: Doug Ford favours putting elderly into institutional care
What COVID-19 has taught us about caring for our elders, Jan. 5
The writer makes an explicit assumption in her remarks about the effects of the pandemic and possible solutions to the care that many older and frail Canadians require; she says that institutional care would not be favoured by most people in a rights-based social policy model. I couldn't agree more.
Unfortunately, the Ford government's fixation on more institutional beds (30,000 more at a cost of $6 billion) is prohibiting all other options that older people say they want.
As a result, there is a serious imbalance in public investment in care for older people that favours and funnels people into institutional care instead of enabling people to live in the home and community of their choice with support. This needs to be corrected.
Douglas Cartan, Mallorytown, Ont.
Under Ford's bill, long-term grief homes will flourish
Ford's Bill 37 tolls for all of us, Jan. 4
Under this bill, it appears that long-term grief homes (formerly long- term care) will continue to flourish in Ontario. So, may we expect to read more reports of understaffing, neglect and abuse of residents, many preventable deaths, and no penalties for disregard of even basic safeguards?
Ontario is definitely "open for business," as Premier Ford hurries to ensure continuance of for-profit homes.
It's been a highly profitable business whether elderly residents were well or poorly treated.
Scrooge, before he reformed, would have felt very comfortable with the uncaring policies of Ford's government.
Wesley Turner, St. Catharines
Let the elderly boycott Ford's for-profit homes!
Ford's Bill 37 tolls for all of us, Jan. 4
One would have to be in a coma not to notice that almost all older Canadians want more home care, yet Doug Ford is determined to stuff long-term care down our throats.
Indeed, with Bill 37, he has guaranteed for-profit LTC in our future business, and locked Ontario into LTC without any viable alternatives. But what if, in the many thousands, we refuse to go and fill these new beds in nursing homes? What if we forge ahead and create our own alternatives, like cohabiting, intergenerational homes, dementia villages, and so on?
Will we put LTC out of business for lack of customers? And, if so, will Ford have thrown billions of our taxpayer dollars down the unsustainable and bottomless pit of LTC? Older citizens of Ontario rise up and vote, we have only our institutional chains to lose!
Salvatore Amenta, Stouffville

Full text: When Brexit and the coronavirus blurred into a political fog engulfing the U.K. last year, at the centre of it inevitably stood the leader who has been defined by both.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson stuck to the line that his country was at a turning point, on the cusp of a return to greatness after leaving the European Union. A shortage of critical workers, supply chain disruption and a roller-coaster resurgence of virus infections were bumps in the road on the journey to his much-vaunted "Global Britain."
As the world confronts the latest incarnation of COVID-19, the U.K. has record infections and taken another hit to the economy. But for Johnson, Brexit and the pandemic are morphing into a political demon that now risks slipping out of his control after the more radical elements of his party gained the upper hand.
One year into "going it alone," British civil servants have been told to avoid the word Brexit. Johnson, the champion of the U.K.'s new freedoms, often looks like a moderate next to some of his more libertarian, free-market colleagues. Many pro-Brexit members of Parliament from his governing Conservative Party are now often the ones questioning his virus restrictions.
The nation, meanwhile, is having a pang of buyer's remorse. A survey by Deltapoll published this week found that 10 per cent of Brexit voters think it's been a success, albeit with 67 per cent of that "leave" cohort reckoning it will eventually come good. The company questioned 1,567 adults on Dec. 23-30.
Globally, the disconnection between how the U.K sees itself - exceptional, front and centre stage - versus the diminished power in the eyes of the outside world is jarring. By the time Brexit finally happened on Jan. 1 last year, many outsiders were baffled by the choice, but relieved not to have to hear about it again. The U.K., though, won't let go.
Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in a speech in London on Dec. 8 that "Britain is the greatest country on earth" and that "it's time to be proud of who we are and what we stand for." Popular among rank and file Conservatives and seen as a potential rival to Johnson, Truss has taken over tetchy post-Brexit talks with the EU and advocates for a Singapore-style economy of low taxes and light regulations.
A week later, the U.K.'s trade minister, Penny Mordaunt, lectured an audience at the Carter Institute in Atlanta about Brexit. Leaving the EU "is not an event to be mourned by the international community or an act of self-harm or one that requires us to be punished," she said. "America has a choice to make. How will you respond?"
The trouble is that President Joe Biden already gave Johnson an answer in September. He explicitly told the prime minister that a U.S.-U.K. trade deal, the one promised as the ultimate Brexit prize, was on the back burner. Erik Fossing Nielsen, who served as chief economist at Unicredit and Goldman Sachs, called Mordaunt's speech "bonkers" and "a display of complete ignorance and a fair amount of arrogance."
Brexit Britain still has some punch. Johnson, who almost died of COVID-19 in 2020, faces an awkward inquiry into how the country ended up with one of the world's highest death tolls. Yet its stellar vaccine rollout has won plaudits globally and a higher proportion of people have had their booster shots than in any large economy in Europe, a critical tool in fighting Omicron.
The U.K. has also shown it can still have an impact on the global stage.
When a new nuclear-powered submarine deal between the U.S., U.K. and Australia was suddenly announced in September, Johnson presented it as evidence of that growing clout. France, which was incensed to be cut out of the military alliance, saw it as betraying the extent to which the U.K. was willing to become a vassal state of the U.S.
French diplomats also see Johnson as too ready to find scapegoats for everything that has gone wrong after Brexit.
That's very much a tactic of the U.K. leader, said Helene von Bismarck, a historian focused on Britain's relationship with Europe. The aim is to find "bogeymen inside and outside the country to put blame on," she said, "keeping everyone entertained, furious and anxious and nervous so as to keep people distracted from his deficiencies."
One thing that has distinguished post-Brexit Britain from the rest of Europe has been attitudes toward the virus. In the U.K., there is little enforcement of mask-wearing and also an aversion to curbing people's freedom. Many in the EU have gone for much harder restrictions.
Still, the debate about more COVID restrictions is heated in the U.K., and it runs along the same ideological lines as the Brexit dispute. It's entirely possible Johnson won't be in power this time next year in spite of sitting on a commanding majority in Parliament. He needed opposition votes recently to pass legislation on new virus restrictions after about 100 of his MPs rebelled.
But it will be Brexit, while the making of him, that could yet prove his undoing rather than the pandemic. Michel Barnier, the EU's Brexit negotiator, wrote in his published diary of the talks that he was struck by how Johnson didn't appear worried about collateral damage.
His party is ruthless about turning on a prime minister when the time comes. Margaret Thatcher famously never lost an election and yet was ousted in a palace coup.
"He used to be so immune to it and nothing seemed to touch him," said Von Bismarck. "Now that seems to be changing. It's not going to end with Johnson."

Full text: It’s been a fixer-upper for years.
So is it time to gut this old House?
Officials at Ontario’s aging legislature think so and look longingly to Parliament Hill, where the Centre Block is getting a $5-billion, decade-long renovation to bring it up to contemporary standards.
In a building that opened in 1893, and is now better known for leaks of political secrets, they point to frequently spurting original pipes at Queen’s Park, where signs warning “DO NOT DRINK TAP WATER” were placed in washrooms more than a decade ago because of lead contamination.
There’s also asbestos insulation, decades of jerry-rigged and exposed wiring through offices and in the ceilings, and a wonky, ancient steam heating system that leaves some occupants huddling over space heaters (hello, blown fuses) and others rushing to open windows wide, even on frigid January days, to avoid a free sauna.
But it’s the damage from flooding and other problems in the heavily retrofitted edifice that causes the most concern. The hours-long tracing of a recent pinhole leak required workers to find a shut-off valve that had been drywalled over, an effort that took opening parts of three floors and three walls. By that time, two rooms in the basement were wading pools.
“We don’t want to wait until there’s a catastrophe,” says Ted Arnott, the veteran Progressive Conservative MPP who was elected speaker of the legislature after Premier Doug Ford’s 2018 election victory.
“We need to make it safe and we need to modernize.”
In November, a workman got a surprise when his foot burst through the fourth floor, sending debris into the washroom of the speaker’s third floor apartment.
“Thankfully, I wasn’t in here at the time,” Arnott says as he points to a patch above the sink during a tour of the building with Jelena Bajcetic, director of the legislature’s precinct properties branch, clerk of the legislature Todd Decker and Minister of Legislative Affairs Paul Calandra.
They have been preparing and planning for a full renovation they hope to begin in 2025 — once an alternate location can be found and MPPs, staff, civil servants and journalists moved out, as has taken place in Ottawa with the House of Commons relocated to the recently renovated West Block .
“I’d like to see the building restored with all the modern utility that is required ... with its original look and feel,” Calandra says in his west wing corner office, which is notable for its dark wooden wainscotting and trim.
“People expect the building to be maintained in a way we can be proud of,” he adds during the tour, which took place in late November as word of the Omicron variant was first emerging.
There is no official cost estimate yet, but the b-word, as in billion, is being used for the job that could include reopening skylights and windows long ago covered over, restoring some original grandeur along with improving the dismal lighting in darker areas.
Although the idea of a move-everyone-out, top-to-bottom renovation pre-dates the pandemic, there are the optics of embarking on an expensive major project at a time the province has gone billions deeper into debt to finance the COVID-19 response.
“There’s never a good time to start this, but right now we’re going through an emergency,” says New Democratic Party deputy leader John Vanthof, who acknowledges the value of preserving the building. “Right now, our focus should be on getting Ontario through this.”
Nevertheless, consultants have been going through the premises cataloguing the many problems to be solved and upgrades needed to make the Pink Palace (so named for the colour of its exterior stone) ready for another century as the seat of government.
In the basement, which was never intended as more than that but now houses a cafeteria, mail room, dining room and more, thick cast iron steam pipes run under the floor. It is hot to the touch. More steam pipes run through the ceiling, with all manner of wires and cables snaking around them.
Should one of those ceiling steam pipes crack or leak, damage to the wires could put parts of the building out of commission.
“Electrical is one of the biggest issues,” says Bajcetic.
While it can take a good five minutes to get lukewarm water out of a tap on the top floors, the water in the first floor west-wing washrooms is luxuriously hot.
There are questions, too, about what the building should ultimately include.
The plan is to eliminate the viceregal suite that was constructed in the late 1930s as the Depression-era government of Liberal premier Mitchell Hepburn sold off the lieutenant governor’s Chorley Park residence as a cost-saving measure.
Calandra also wants every MPP to have an office within the building, instead of having some scattered in others nearby.
Green Leader Mike Schreiner says he supports a renovation but urges the government to create an all-party committee to discuss it because only parties with 12 MPPs are considered “official” — meaning the Greens and Liberals are not on the board of internal economy.
“This building should have been renovated a long time ago,” he told the Star.
“We have to make it more energy-efficient. It’s ridiculous how much energy this building wastes and how much money it costs us. We need to upgrade the pipes. We can’t even drink the water. And while the government’s talking about electric vehicles, why not have some EV charging stations?”
In the last five years, work that didn’t have to wait for a full renovation has already been done.
A drainage upgrade to the foundation around the building cost $20 million, restoration of the exterior masonry and windows took another $10 million and there have been various fire safety and other upgrades costing up to $2 million.
“We could continue to do it piecemeal, but that is inefficient, takes longer and costs more,” says Arnott.
“If you look down the street, most of those buildings weren’t there 100 years ago,” adds Decker, nodding south toward hospital row along University Avenue.
“But 100 years from now, this building will still be the provincial parliament.”

Full text: The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Saturday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available .
10:41 p.m.: Up to 1 million COVID-19 test kits were left to expire inside a Florida warehouse amid a nationwide shortage triggered by a winter surge of coronavirus cases.
At a news conference held by Gov. Ron DeSantis, Kevin Guthrie, the director of Florida’s Division of Emergency Management, confirmed the stockpile of kits, manufactured by Abbott Laboratories, sat unused.
“We had between 800,000 and a million test kits, Abbott rapid test kits, in our warehouse that did expire,” Guthrie told reporters, adding that they were rendered ineffective sometime “before December 26 to December 30.”
Guthrie also defended the kit reserve, claiming that there was not an adequate demand for them — even though people have reported waiting for hours to get tested, particularly in central Florida, starting around mid-December, according to The Orlando Sentinel.
During the same news conference, DeSantis said he planned to ask President Joe Biden to extend their expiration deadline before revealing plans to send 1 million at-home COVID-19 tests to nursing homes, long-term care facilities, and other residences with high numbers of seniors in the state.
“Having a stockpile was the right thing to do,” If we had done the opposite, we would have run out,” DeSantis said. “No one really wanted them for many, many months.”
In recent weeks, COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations have spiked in Florida, thanks in part to the quick-spreading omicron variant. The state is averaging 37,563 new cases a day over the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University.
10:22 p.m.: Minnesota’s COVID-19 positivity rate over the past seven days reached 15.6 per cent on Friday, in an indication of the rapid spread of the omicron variant across the state. State health officials said the figure demonstrates the increasing spread of the omicron variant and expect a new surge of case growth for at least the next month. Minnesota’s previous positivity rate record come early in the pandemic in April 2020, when testing capacity was much more limited. The Minnesota Hospital Association is urging people to look for tests in settings other than hospital emergency rooms due to a high number of patients statewide.
9:06 p.m.: Perennial national medallist Nam Nguyen contracted COVID-19 last week, and was still feeling the effects at the Canadian figure skating championships on Saturday.
Nguyen, who won the world junior championships in 2014 and the Canadian senior title in 2019, was considered a favourite to make Canada’s skating team for the Beijing Olympics.
But the 23-year-old from Toronto was seventh after the short program on Friday and struggled in his free program on Saturday, saying after his skate that his lungs were still feeling the effects of the virus.
Nguyen said he isolated for five days after his positive PCR test, and then was back on the ice on Tuesday after a negative test.
Nguyen had said a few weeks ago that he planned to retire following this season, but is rethinking that decision, saying he doesn’t want to leave the sport on such a low note.
Stephen Gogolev withdrew from the men’s singles competition on Friday after testing positive for the coronavirus. The 17-year-old from Toronto was the national silver medallist in 2019.
8:51 p.m.: Japanese and U.S. government officials have agreed that U.S. forces stationed in Japan won’t leave their bases unless essential in an effort to stem the spread of COVID-19 cases in the Asian nation, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Sunday.
Kishida was speaking on public broadcaster NHK. He said that the details of the agreement were still being worked out.
The U.S. recently sought to reassure Japan it’s working to protect public health after Tokyo called for restrictions on American troops stationed in the country amid record COVID-19 outbreaks in some areas, which may have stemmed in part from U.S. bases.
8:44 p.m.: The Edmonton Oilers placed five more players into the NHL’s COVID-19 protocols Saturday.
Forwards Kailer Yamamoto and Brendan Perlini, goaltender Ilya Konovalov and defensemen Evan Bouchard and Slater Koekkoek were added to the list. Star center Connor McDavid, defenseman Tyson Barrie and center Derek Ryan were already in the protocols.
Six members of the team’s support staff also were added to the list Saturday.
Nashville scoring leader Filip Forsberg was a late scratch against Arizona Saturday night after being placed into COVID-19 protocols.
Forsberg entered Thursday tied for ninth in the NHL with 18 goals and has 11 assists. He had three straight games with multiple points, including four goals.
Nashville defenseman Dante Fabbro missed his fourth straight game while in COVID-19 protocols.
Pittsburgh added forwards Bryan Rust and Brock McGinn to the protocols list before their 3-2 loss at Dallas on Saturday.
8:39 p.m.: Australia’s New South Wales state reported 16 deaths on Sunday in its deadliest day of the pandemic, even as it relaxed rules to allow some essential workers in isolation to return to work if they are asymptomatic.
Just over 30,000 new cases were reported in Australia’s most populous state, forcing those people to join more than 200,000 others in isolation.
No statistics are kept to determine how many of those are essential workers in the food and manufacturing sectors. But some employers say up to half of their workers have been furloughed after coming into contact with a positive case.
Shoppers have reported empty shelves in many supermarkets because of the omicron outbreak’s impact on food processing and supply chains.
“Critical workers in the food logistics and manufacturing sectors furloughed as close contacts will be permitted to leave self-isolation to attend work if they have no symptoms of COVID-19, to ensure the state has continued access to essential goods,” New South Wales Health said in a statement on Sunday.
The workers can only leave self-isolation if their employer decides their absence poses a high risk of disruption to the delivery of critical services and if they are not able to work from home.
Returning workers will have to wear masks and comply with risk-management strategies required by their employers, including daily rapid antigen tests. If they test positive, they will have to return to isolation.
The rule change applies in agriculture to bio-security and food safety personnel undertaking critical duties; in manufacturing to the production of food, beverages, groceries, cleaning and sanitary products; and in transport to food logistics and delivery.
The 16 people who died Sunday included eight women and eight men aged in their 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s, NSW Health said. The figure tops the previous record of 15 deaths, which has been reached twice, on Sept. 29 and Oct. 1 last year.
8:34 p.m.: Los Angeles continued to see an omicron-fueled surge in coronavirus cases Saturday, as staffing shortages necessitated the deployment of California National Guard troops to testing sites and caused the state to permit hospitals to relax rules about letting infected workers return to work.
County public health officials said they had recorded more than 200,000 new coronavirus cases over the past seven days, the highest one-week total of the pandemic. Hospitalizations doubled during the period, to 3,200 patients as of Friday. More than 20 per cent of coronavirus tests are returning positive results, the county said.
On Saturday, L.A. County reported 34,448 new cases and 16 related deaths; however, officials said the true numbers are likely higher because of delays in reporting over the holiday and weekend.
“Our hearts remain with those families experiencing the sorrow of losing those they love to COVID,” Barbara Ferrer, the county public health director, said in a statement. She reminded residents and businesses to continue following safety measures, including wearing medical-grade masks and avoiding those who are not masked.
Experts stress that although case counts are higher than they were during last winter’s peak, when L.A. County was recording about 16,000 a day, fewer people are becoming severely ill from the omicron variant. Even the hospitalization numbers don’t tell the whole story, as some counties are seeing a growing percentage of people entering hospitals with a coronavirus infection but being treated for something other than COVID-19.
7:12 p.m.: New York state on Saturday added more hospitals to its list of those ordered to postpone elective surgeries for at least two weeks as the surge in COVID-19 cases threatens to overwhelm hospitals.
The list now includes 40 hospitals that have “met the state’s threshold for ‘high risk regions’ or low-capacity facilities,” the Department of Health said in a statement Saturday.
All 31 hospitals in the Mohawk Valley, Finger Lakes and Central regions are now included on the list, and the nine others are scattered throughout the state, according to the statement. None are in New York City. The hospitals must cancel procedures starting Thursday.
The size of the list has fluctuated since early December, when an executive order issued by Gov. Kathy Hochul went into effect to limit elective surgeries before another spike in cases. There were 28 hospitals on the list as recently as Dec. 20.
“We will use every available tool to help ensure that hospitals can manage the COVID-19 winter surge,” Dr. Mary T. Bassett, the acting health commissioner, said in a statement Saturday. “I want to remind New Yorkers that getting vaccinated and boosted remain the best way to protect against serious illness and hospitalization from COVID-19. Vaccination also protects our hospital system. We cannot return to the early months of the pandemic when hospitals were overwhelmed.”
As the omicron variant of the coronavirus sweeps through New York, many hospitals are being pushed to their limits by the twin challenges of soaring new cases and growing shortages of nurses, doctors and technicians.
New York state reported a record 90,132 daily new cases, Hochul’s office said Saturday. In the past three days, 439 people have died from the virus, an 80 per cent increase from the same period a week earlier. Two hundred of those deaths were in New York City, more than doubling the number from last week.
7:05 p.m.: California officials say hospitals are admitting children with COVID-19 at an unprecedented rate, mirroring a nationwide trend as the omicron variant continues spreading across the United States.
While the number of kids entering hospitals is on the rise, physicians say the severity of their infections is not as bad as those seen in previous surges.
In a call with reporters on Wednesday, California Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly said the admissions are higher than ones recorded last winter when cases soared.
“Just like other states are reporting, other nations are reporting, more young people with COVID are being admitted,” Ghaly said. “In California, we have admitted more patients on a day-to-day basis over the last few days than we did even at the peak of last winter’s surge.”
The previous record for pediatric admissions was 41 in one day, according to the California Department of Health. At that time about one year ago, adult admissions numbered about 3,000.
Now, the department said it has seen daily pediatric admissions of 50 to 60 children for three days straight. On Jan. 4, the state reached 90 pediatric admissions in one day.
The adult admission rate, meanwhile, remains lower than it was last year, about 1,600 to 2,200 adult COVID-19 hospitalizations a day. Ghaly said hospitals are able to take on the demand for pediatric admissions, and that many of the children who are admitted aren’t put in intensive care or on ventilators.
6:58 p.m.: New York City school officials fought to keep schools open through a record-breaking surge of Omicron cases. Now, students, parents and teachers are grappling with the consequences.
Roughly 300,000 students missed class on average this week in the nation’s largest school district, which serves 1 million. For others, going to class in-person consisted of little actual learning as students were herded into auditoriums with teachers in short supply. Students stuck at home had no virtual option, and parents had to decide whether to send their children in or risk them falling further behind after years of disrupted, pandemic education.
The situation in New York stands in contrast to Chicago, where the teacher’s union has clashed with the city in a public face-off that closed schools for multiple days after winter break. Both illustrate the dire state of education in the U.S. that has reopened old debates and infuriated teachers, parents and officials.
New York Mayor Eric Adams has maintained that schools need to be open, and that warmth, food and supervision are invaluable for the city’s low-income or homeless students. “Schools play a role of safety and stability for our children,” Adams said Monday at Concourse Village in the Bronx.
Omicron has exploded citywide in schools. There were more than 8,000 student and 1,400 staff cases reported as of Friday evening, according to the city’s Department of Education. Attendance the first week back hovered around 70 per cent. On Friday, when the city was covered in snow, less than half of the student body showed up.
With infections so high, schools have struggled to keep operations running smoothly. Teachers are reluctant to teach new material to vacant classrooms. When teachers call in sick, substitute teachers are in short supply. To cope, some schools moved teacher-less students to auditoriums or gyms.
6:48 p.m.: Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday called for California lawmakers to approve $1.4 billion in emergency COVID-19 money as the omicron variant surges.
Most of that money would go to expanding hospital surge capacity and increasing testing, including by expanding the hours at testing sites and sending millions of rapid tests to local health departments, community clinics and schools.
Newsom’s call for additional funding comes as testing demand outstrips supply in California, resulting in long lines at testing sites and longer wait times for results.
On Friday, the Democratic governor started sending 200 members of the National Guard to help staff testing sites to add capacity for walk-in appointments, manage crowds and backfill staff who catch the virus and must isolate.
The highly infectious omicron variant now accounts for at least 80% of COVID-19 cases in California, according to Newsom’s office. The state’s daily case rate has skyrocketed, and more than 1 in 5 tests are coming back positive, according to state data.
Newsom would also use the money to speed vaccination efforts, including by fighting misinformation about vaccines and partnering with ethnic media outlets, according to the governor’s office.
Newsom plans to seek an additional $1.3 billion for COVID-19 response later this year in the 2022-23 budget, which takes effect July 1. He is also calling for the Legislature to create a new COVID-19 supplemental sick leave policy for front-line workers who contract the coronavirus or have to care for an infected family member.
“From day one California has taken swift and direct action to battle COVID-19 with policies that have saved tens of thousands of lives, but there’s more work to be done,” Newsom said in a statement. “Our proposed COVID-19 emergency response package will support our testing capacity, accelerate vaccination and booster efforts, support front-line workers and health care systems and battle misinformation.”
On Monday, Newsom will announce his full budget proposal for the 2022-23 fiscal year, including plans on how to spend an estimated $31 billion surplus.
6:13 p.m.: New York reported a record 90,132 new COVID-19 cases on Saturday as the state passed 4 million total infections since the start of the pandemic.
Another 154 people died, one of the highest daily figures in almost a year. Hospitalizations continued to increase to 11,843 and the state’s health care system remains significantly strained.
Testing rose from the previous day, to 425,782, of which 21.17% were positive. That number is in line with the previous day’s positivity rate, even with almost 50,000 more tests administered.
New York is the fourth state to surpass 4 million infections, after California, Texas and Florida, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg.
6:09 p.m.: Ambulances in Kansas speed toward hospitals then suddenly change direction because hospitals are full. Employee shortages in New York City cause delays in trash and subway services and diminish the ranks of firefighters and emergency workers. Airport officials shut down security checkpoints at the biggest terminal in Phoenix and schools across the nation struggle to find teachers for their classrooms.
The current explosion of omicron-fueled coronavirus infections in the U.S. is causing a breakdown in basic functions and services — the latest illustration of how COVID-19 keeps upending life more than two years into the pandemic.
“This really does, I think, remind everyone of when COVID-19 first appeared and there were such major disruptions across every part of our normal life,” said Tom Cotter, director of emergency response and preparedness at the global health nonprofit Project HOPE. “And the unfortunate reality is, there’s no way of predicting what will happen next until we get our vaccination numbers — globally — up.”
First responders, hospitals, schools and government agencies have employed an all-hands-on-deck approach to keep the public safe, but they are worried how much longer they can keep it up.
In Kansas’ Johnson County, paramedics are working 80 hours a week. Ambulances have frequently been forced to alter their course when the hospitals they’re heading to tell them they’re too overwhelmed to help, confusing the patients’ already anxious family members driving behind them. When the ambulances arrive at hospitals, some of their emergency patients end up in waiting rooms because there are no beds.
4 p.m.: Ontario is reporting 385 people in intensive care units due to COVID-19 and 2,594 in hospital after testing positive for COVID-19, according to the latest update released Saturday morning.
That’s an increase from Friday when 2,472 people were hospitalized and 338 were in intensive care units. The province has 2,343 adult ICU beds and as of Saturday 570 remain available.
Provincial numbers for overall hospitalizations should be used with caution as a factor in determining the severity of COVID-19 cases because they include people who have tested positive but are not hospitalized as a direct result of the virus. In some cases, individual hospitals have said nearly 50 per cent of people testing positive weren’t admitted due to COVID.
Given new provincial regulations around testing that took effect Dec. 31, 2021, case counts — reported at 13,362 on Saturday, up from 11, 899 the previous day — are also not considered an accurate assessment of how widespread COVID-19 may be. There were 31 new deaths caused by COVID.

3:58 p.m.: The U.S. company Moderna donated 2.7 million doses of coronavirus vaccine to Mexico Saturday as the country’s official death toll topped 300,000.
Mexico passed 300,000 test-confirmed coronavirus deaths this week, but so little testing is done in the country that a government review of death certificates puts to real toll at almost 460,000.
Mexican officials welcomed the arrival of the shipment at the airport in Toluca, just west of Mexico City, and said the vaccines will be used to inoculate teachers.
Teachers in Mexico were second after only health care workers to be vaccinated in the spring.
In April and May, over 2.7 million teachers got initial shots. But most of them got the single-dose Chinese Cansino vaccine, whose effectiveness appears to decline over time.
Mexico has now obtained over 200 million doses of vaccines, and has been trying to reopen in-person learning at all levels.
Education Secretary Delfina Gómez said, “We are grateful to recieve this donation, which will undoubtedly help more boys, girls and youths to come to classrooms with greater safety and confidence.”
3:55 p.m.: As parts of Canada see staggering rises in COVID-19 activity amid Omicron’s rapid spread, experts say the highly transmissible variant is training a spotlight on social inequities across the country.
Dr. Amit Arya, a palliative care physician in Mississauga, Ont., said Omicron’s rise continues to show “a tale of two pandemics — rich and poor,” with those who can afford to better protect themselves pitted against those who can’t.
He said lower-income populations often don’t have the funds to buy upgraded masks or rapid antigen tests, nor can they easily take time off work to isolate or get their booster doses.
“If you have money, you’re able to afford the protection you need to survive and be safe,” he said.
Essential workers bore the brunt of COVID-19 infections during Canada’s Delta-driven wave last spring, and Arya said low-wage employees are likely to experience some of that again.
As provinces scale back eligibility for PCR testing, he pointed out that private testing companies in Ontario, which can offer same-day results for those willing to pay $160 or more for the service, further show an income divide in how people can deal with COVID-19.
Risk profiles have also differed across economic lines throughout the pandemic, Arya said, but the more transmissible Omicron virus variant may exacerbate them.
“(Essential workers) by definition have to leave the house to work,” he said. “They might be taking public transit to work, they might be working around 400 people in a distribution centre ... many frontline workers are racialized, they’re immigrants to Canada, they’re more likely to live in multi-generational households with elders and vulnerable children who aren’t vaccinated.”
Cynthia Carr, an epidemiologist in Winnipeg, said while that all holds true, the heightened spread of Omicron makes it harder for everyone, regardless of economic status, to avoid exposure.
The difference with lower-income groups, however, is what happens once they’re infected.
“I do think it’s shifting in terms of perhaps everyone bearing the brunt, but with sick days and isolation, that’s where the change is,” she said. “If I’m infected, I’m fortunate and fully vaccinated. I may be mildly ill, if at all, and I can continue to work because I’m at home.”
1:22 p.m.: Quebec reported 44 more deaths attributed to the novel coronavirus Saturday, the highest daily death toll in nearly a year.
The sharp increase from a day earlier, when health officials reported 27 deaths, marks the worst tally since Jan. 27, 2021, when 45 deaths were reported.
The province also cited an 11 per cent rise in COVID-19-related hospitalizations as the Omicron variant continues to surge.
There are currently 2,296 patients with the disease — 163 more than the prior day — with 245 people in intensive care, a rise of 16 from the day before, health officials said.
The province reported 15,928 new cases of COVID-19, as health workers administered an additional 100,892 vaccine doses.
Amid the Omicron wave, the Quebec College of Physicians urged the province to “step up the pace” of measures that limit the public’s exposure to unvaccinated individuals.
“The vaccinated population can no longer suffer in silence from the constraints of sanitary measures while unvaccinated people occupy one in two beds in short-term and the majority of beds in intensive care,” wrote college president Dr. Mauril Gaudreault.
Gaudreault also backed a future requirement for third doses in order to hold a vaccine passport, stating in a letter Friday that the measure should take effect faster “and cover a vast set of shops and public places.”
On Thursday, Health Minister Christian Dubé announced that proof of vaccination will be necessary to make purchases at Quebec’s liquor and cannabis retailers starting Jan. 18. He said he also plans to add non-essential services, “such as personal care,” to the list.
His federal counterpart, Jean-Yves Duclos, went even further on Friday, saying a potential compulsory vaccination is “the only way out” of the health crisis but noting the decision lies in the hands of the provinces.
1:21 p.m.: Figures released Saturday show continued growth in COVID-19 cases in Atlantic Canada, with hospitals around the region reporting they are nearing or over capacity.
Nova Scotia reported 1,145 new cases of COVID-19 on Saturday, with public health urging those who test positive to inform people they’ve been in close contact with.
The province says it is now limiting contact tracing to long-term care settings, healthcare facilities, correctional facilities, shelters and other group environments.
Meanwhile, in New Brunswick, the province updated figures Saturday to indicate that it had 421 new cases, and one new death.
The number of people in hospital rose from 69 to 80, with 17 of those in intensive care and 11 on ventilators.
Dorothy Shephard, the New Brunswick minister of Health, said on Friday she believes it’s likely the health system will soon be “tested like never before” as close to 350 health workers in the province are off work due to the virus.
The Vitalite Health Network has stated half of its hospitals have an occupancy rate of more than 100 per cent. The Miramichi Regional Hospital is also operating over capacity, with other hospitals in the Horizon Health Network saying their capacity levels ranged from 90 to 97 per cent.
Dr. Robert Strang, the chief medical officer of health in Nova Scotia, said earlier this week that a similar situation is emerging in the province’s hospitals and has asked residents to avoid using emergency care when they don’t have an urgent health care issue.
“Omicron is having a significant impact on our health care workforce,” Strang said during a news conference on Wednesday. “Our hospitals are over capacity and for Nova Scotians that means waiting too long for care or having long-awaited tests or procedures cancelled.”
“The reality is there’s very little flex in our health system right now.”
As of Friday, Nova Scotia Health was reporting about 430 staff members were unavailable for work in the central zone.
Earlier this week, the province announced schools will be teaching online only until Jan. 17, and extended existing restrictions — including limitations on the number of people in restaurants and group gatherings — to the end of the month.
But Nova Scotia is permitting people who test positive, and are vaccinated, to remain in isolation for just seven days rather than 10.
Newfoundland and Labrador reported 412 new cases of COVID-19 on Saturday, bringing the total number of active infections to 4,664. There are four hospitalizations in the province.
In Prince Edward Island, the province announced a number of its health facilities were temporarily closed due to an overnight storm, including the COVID-19 vaccine booking line and some vaccine clinics.
10:31 a.m.: Ontario is reporting 2,594 people hospitalized with COVID-19 and 385 people in intensive care units. The province reported 13,362 new cases. The seven-day rolling average of COVID-19 related patients in intensive care units is 295. On Friday, 184,000 vaccine doses were administered. To date, 88.4 per cent of Ontarians age 12 and up have two doses of a COVID vaccine.
9:30 a.m.: Ontario is opening more vaccine clinics in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton area to increase access to booster shots for education and child care staff, Education Minister Stephen Lecce and Solicitor General Sylvia Jones said in a statement.
The 10 additional clinics, three in Toronto — Yonge Street, midtown, Eaton Centre — and one each in Richmond Hill, Mississauga, Vaughan, Pickering, Hamilton, Oakville and Brampton will serve education and child care staff with dedicated time slots. The clinics will administer booster doses and will operate seven days a week by appointment.
One of the 10 vaccination clinics will be situated inside the Toronto Zoo and operate seven days a week, offering dedicated time slots for education and child care staff between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m., Monday to Friday, and on weekends throughout the day. Staff eligible to book an appointment at one of these 10 locations can do so starting Jan. 8, 2022.
9:20 a.m.: COVID-19 vaccine doses administered to the kids aged five to 11 in Ontario have dropped off significantly over the last three weeks, a sign that the province is facing an uphill battle to vaccinate even a majority of children in this age cohort before school returns to in-person learning.
As of Thursday, almost seven weeks after appointments opened, just 45 per cent of kids in the five-to-11 age group had received at least one dose, according to provincial data, while the number of first doses given out has stalled at less than 5,000 a day in the last week.
“This is alarming,” said Peter Jüni, scientific director of Ontario’s COVID-19 Science Advisory Table. “Even though the risk of hospital admissions is still low in children, with so many infections happening right now it’s a numbers game. So it’s really important to get them fully vaccinated as soon as possible.”

7:45 a.m.: How do you make sure Ontario’s two million students are back in school Jan. 17?
Try N95s for all teachers and staff. Improve ventilation. Make sure everyone who is eligible has received their COVID-19 vaccines and boosters. Keep testing. And keep tracking cases in schools and report them publicly.
That’s the list of must-haves from educators, school officials and other experts who say that without these improvements, online learning will be extended past the mid-January date Premier Doug Ford recently announced.
Ontario students are already suffering from being at home, learning in front of a screen yet again, given they have spent more time out of class than any others in North America since the pandemic began.

7:35 a.m.: Hundreds of people rallied in Beirut on Saturday to protest measures imposed against the unvaccinated, saying individuals should have the right to decide whether to be inoculated or not.
Vaccination is not compulsory in Lebanon, but in recent days authorities have cracked down on people who are not inoculated or don’t carry a negative PCR test.
Saturday’s protest by nearly 300 people in downtown Beirut came a day after the daily number of new coronavirus cases hit a record 7,974.
The protest came days after authorities imposed fresh restrictions — including the requirement of a vaccination certificate or negative PCR test for entry into restaurants, hotels and similar venues.

7:15 a.m.: Novak Djokovic’s lawyers filed court papers Saturday in his challenge against deportation from Australia that show the tennis star tested positive for COVID-19 last month and recovered, grounds he used in applying for a medical exemption to the country’s strict vaccination rules.
The No. 1-ranked Djokovic was denied entry at the Melbourne airport late Wednesday after border officials cancelled his visa for failing to meet its entry requirement that all non-citizens be fully vaccinated for COVID-19.
Djokovic was given a medical exemption backed by the Victoria state government and Australian Open organizers on Jan. 1, based on information he supplied to two independent medical panels, and he was approved for a visa electronically.

7 a.m.: As Canada confronts climbing COVID-19 case counts, rising hospitalizations and worker shortages, there’s one measure some experts say could stave off a worsening crisis: emergency approval of Pfizer’s oral antiviral pill.
The drug, known as Paxlovid, was approved in the United States and South Korea for emergency use in late December. Several days later, regulators in the United Kingdom also gave the treatment a green light after completing a “ rigorous ” review of its effectiveness. Israel recently became one of the first nations to dispense the pills, shortly after giving it the thumbs up.
But in this country, the drug is still awaiting approval.
Health Canada received an application for the antiviral on Dec. 1, but told the Star that while all COVID-19 submissions are processed on an expedited timeline, the regulator is not planning to further accelerate its ongoing review. Regular approval of drugs in Canada can take anywhere from several months to two years.

6:30 a.m.: U.K. government advisers have recommended against giving a fourth dose of COVID-19 vaccine to nursing home residents and people over 80 because data shows that a third shot offers lasting protection against admission to the hospital.
For people over 65, protection against hospitalization remains at about 90 per cent three months after the third dose, according to data compiled by the U.K. Health Security Agency.
As a result, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization on Friday advised the government that there was no need to offer a fourth dose, or second booster, to vulnerable people at this time. Instead, the government should focus on giving a third dose to as many people as possible to boost protection against the highly transmissible omicron variant.

6:25 a.m.: Coronavirus cases fuelled by the highly transmissible Omicron variant are rocketing through India, prompting the federal government and states to swiftly reintroduce a string of restrictions.
Night curfews are back. Restaurants and bars are running at half their capacity. Some states have closed schools and movie theatres. Large gatherings are to be downsized.
But India’s political leaders are busy on the campaign trail ahead of crucial state polls, addressing packed rallies of tens of thousands of people, many without masks.
The scenes are strikingly similar to last year’s election season, when the Delta variant ravaged the country and made India one of the world’s worst-hit countries. Some political parties have begun to curtail their campaigns and halt a few rallies, but health experts worry that the lessons learned last year have already been forgotten.
“The highly transmissible omicron variant chases and catches you. But our politicians are out there to welcome it with a hug,” said Dr. T. Jacob John, an Indian virologist. “I fear it is beginning to look a lot like last year.”
6:20 a.m.: One of two people who attended a large gathering with senior Hong Kong officials and was believed to be infected with COVID-19 turned out to be a false positive, meaning about 80 of more than 180 attendees may no longer face a lengthy quarantine.
The birthday party at a restaurant on Monday evening has roiled officialdom, drawing a rebuke from city leader Carrie Lam who criticized about a dozen officials including the police chief and the home affairs secretary for setting a bad example as Hong Kong tries to limit the spread of the Omicron variant.
Microbiologist Yuen Kwok-yung told reporters Saturday that a woman at the party who was a preliminary positive case tested negative in two subsequent tests and had no symptoms. He said the swab used for the initial test, which was conducted by a doctor who is the woman’s husband, may have been contaminated because he had vaccinated 13 other patients earlier.
6 a.m.: Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole is prioritizing his own political future over the health and safety of Canadians by suggesting that people who aren’t vaccinated against COVID-19 should be accommodated and public health lockdowns should come to an end, a government minister charged Friday.
O’Toole’s approach demonstrates a lack of leadership that would only lead to more lockdowns and do nothing to protect Canada’s beleaguered health-care system, Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Dominic LeBlanc told a news conference.
“What seems to concern Mr. O’Toole the most is his own future at the helm of the Conservative party,” LeBlanc said in French.

5 a.m. Tighter pandemic measures came into force in Romania on Saturday as authorities hoped to quell sharply rising coronavirus cases amid concerns that the next virus wave could overstretch the country’s health care system.
In mid-December, Romania was reporting fewer than a thousand COVID-19 infections a day, but over the past week, daily cases have surged to around 6,000. It is the highest number of infections since early November when cases were on the decline following a vicious fourth virus wave.
Over the winter holiday period, hundreds of thousands of Romanians return home from other countries, many from the West, which fuelled concerns over the threat of the fast-spreading Omicron variant. Romania has so far confirmed almost 300 cases of the new variant.

Full text: The lone unvaccinated Progressive Conservative MPP is calling it quits.
Less than five months after Premier Doug Ford decreed that all Tory MPPs and candidates in the June 2 election must have their COVID-19 shots, Christina Mitas (Scarborough-Centre) has announced she will not seek re-election.
While Mitas had a “medical exemption” from vaccination for undisclosed reasons, insiders say her presence in the Tory caucus was a source of consternation to some of Ford’s advisers.
She disclosed her retirement Tuesday.
That was the same day new provincial rules took effect, requiring anyone with a vaccination exemption to have it verified by a local public health unit.
That information will then be included on the Verify Ontario QR code that is used to access indoor services that require proof of vaccination.
“I started off life as an elected official pregnant with my first child and will end this term with three babies three and under,” Mitas, who was first elected in 2018, said in a written statement.
“After careful and honest discussions as a family, I have decided that life as an elected official is not in the best interest of my family at this time. Thus, I am announcing that I will not be seeking re-election this June,” she said.
“I remain a true blue conservative — I believe in small government, family, God and freedom with all my heart.”
Mitas’s departure comes a little more than two months after fellow first-term MPP Lindsey Park (Durham) quit the Tory caucus amid claims from government house leader Paul Calandra that she “misrepresented her vaccination status” to her colleagues.
Park, who has denied that and accused the Tories of issuing a “false statement” about her decision not to get her COVID-19 shots, also had a doctor’s note excusing her from getting vaccinated. She is not running again.
Last August, Ford fired veteran MPP Rick Nicholls (Chatham-Kent-Leamington) from the PC caucus for refusing to get vaccinated.

Full text: The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Thursday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available .
5:47 p.m. The pressure on Quebec hospitals is reaching a point where some heart and cancer-related surgeries risk being postponed to make room for COVID-19 patients, the head of the province's hospital network said Thursday.
"We're in a really critical phase," assistant deputy health minister Dr. Lucie Opatrny told reporters in Montreal. Should hospitals be forced to delay serious procedures for an extended period of time, there will be "side-effects" for patients, she said.
Meanwhile, the number of health-care workers who are off the job due to COVID-19 has reached 20,000, Health Minister Christian Dubé told the news conference, adding that another 30,000 workers are absent for other reasons, including burnout. The rising number of COVID-19 patients and the rate of absenteeism among health staff is "the worst combination" for the province, Dubé said.
5:26 p.m. Public sectors across the country are facing staff shortages as Canada continues to face record-breaking COVID-19 case numbers and hospitalizations related to the highly transmissible Omicron variant.
Quebec Health Minister Christian Dubé said Thursday that about 20,000 health-care workers were off because they had tested positive or been exposed to the virus. The government was working with unions to find more staff to care for roughly 2,500 COVID-19 patients, he added.
Health officials reported another 1,953 COVID-19 hospitalizations Thursday, a rise of almost 12 per cent compared with a day earlier. Officials said there were 207 patients in intensive care, an increase of 16.
5:24 p.m. Amid growing calls from teachers, child-care workers, parents and opposition politicians, the Ontario government announced Thursday that it would be accelerating booster shots for school and child-care staff to help protect them and the children they work with from COVID-19.
In a news release, Education Minister Stephen Lecce said starting Friday, child-care and school staff in the Greater Toronto Hamilton Area will have "planned access to vaccines" at the International Centre in Mississauga, Ont.
He noted the clinic will support priority booking for education staff, including educators, custodial staff, administrative staff, school bus drivers and child-care staff.
5:18 p.m. With COVID-19 galloping through Toronto homeless shelters, staff will be directed to keep infected residents on-site during most outbreaks, with beds at an isolation facility prioritized for the most complex cases.
The shift, outlined in a city memo to service providers on Thursday, comes as more than two dozen shelters across the city have reported outbreaks.
The isolation facility has been under strain, with 65 beds in operation on Thursday and between 60 and 65 patients on-site depending on the hour, said Andrew Bond, medical director of Inner City Health Associates.
Read the full story from the Star’s Victoria Gibson.
5:11 p.m. Outbreaks of COVID-19 in Ontario jails have spiked in the past three weeks, prompting renewed calls for authorities to reduce the prolonged lockdowns confining prisoners to their cells and the number of people imprisoned.
The Star recently spoke to two inmates at the Hamilton-Wentworth Detention Centre, one of 16 jails, prisons and youth detention facilities currently in outbreak, who said the jail is so crowded that some two-person cells are holding three men.
“Imagine being locked in your bathroom for 23 hours like we are animals!” said one man, who requested anonymity to due to fear of repercussions for speaking publicly. “You are sweating in a small space with three men with a toilet that can only flush twice an hour … with your food served to you through a hatch in the door.”
Read the full story from the Star’s Alyshah Hasham.
4:41 p.m. Rapid antigen COVID-19 tests won't be available to the general Ontario population for the next little while amid a supply crunch and an ongoing virus surge — but people with the means to access them can get out of virus-related isolation sooner.
Officials said Thursday that people who develop symptoms can resume their regular activities sooner than the required five days — the new isolation period for fully vaccinated people and kids under 12 — if two rapid tests taken at least 24 hours apart come back negative, and if their symptoms improve for 24 hours.
It's still recommended that people who are sick stay home until symptoms improve.
4:33 p.m. Saskatchewan's chief medical health officer is asking the public to stop gatherings except for work and school.
The province is reporting 913 new cases of COVID-19 — an all-time high — with a test positivity rate of 28 per cent.
Dr. Saqib Shahab cautions that number will go up in the next two to four weeks and now is the time to stop unnecessary indoor gatherings.
4:23 p.m. New Brunswick's hospitals are struggling to provide appropriate and timely care amid rising COVID-19 infections and the high number of health staff who can't work because they have tested positive or have been exposed to the disease.
"Hundreds" of health-care workers are isolating at home, according to a statement Thursday from the Health Department. The government issued an official number on Tuesday — 571 isolating workers — up by 41 from the day prior.
Dr. Mark MacMillan, president of the New Brunswick Medical Society, says the province's hospitals were already facing staffing shortages before the pandemic. In an interview Wednesday, the doctor said COVID-19 is challenging the ability of workers to provide "appropriate and timely care."
3:53 p.m. Through most of the COVID-19 pandemic, Atlantic Canada won international praise for the region’s largely successful efforts to keep infection rates low — but the arrival of Omicron has upended its vaunted COVID-Zero strategy, The Canadian Press reports.
The highly contagious variant, now described as the fastest-spreading virus in human history, has overwhelmed the four provinces’ get-tough-quick approach, which involved rapidly imposing the country’s strictest lockdown measures at the first sign of an outbreak, according to CP.
It may seem laughable now, but in April of last year, Nova Scotia called in the army and declared a two-week lockdown when the province recorded only 96 new infections, at the time, a one-day record high.
Last Sunday, with Omicron on the move, Nova Scotia reported another record: 1,184 cases in one day.
“In the early stages of the pandemic, the transmissibility (of COVID-19) was a lot less,” said Susan Kirkland, head of the department of community health and epidemiology at Dalhousie University in Halifax.
“It was possible to maintain this strategy of COVID-Zero. We did our best to identify every single case with thorough contact tracing ... But we’re at a completely different phase of the pandemic now.”
On Wednesday, health officials in New Brunswick confirmed the province would stop including in its news releases the number of daily cases confirmed by PCR testing, because the latest figures no longer reflect the severity of the situation in the province.
Earlier in the day, Prince Edward Island had reported 222 new cases, a record daily high. Before Omicron arrived in Canada in late November, the Island had recorded a total of just 373 positive cases since the beginning of the pandemic.
In Newfoundland and Labrador, where case counts have also spiked, the healthcare system is under considerable strain, because about 1,000 healthcare workers are in isolation or infected with COVID-19. The province’s chief medical officer of health, Dr. Janice Fitzgerald, conceded Monday that “most people” will contract the virus and the latest measures are aimed at slowing the spread.
“The transmissibility of Omicron is so great that a COVID-Zero strategy is simply not feasible,” said Kirkland, who is also a member of the federal government’s COVID-19 immunity task force. “It’s not helpful at this point. It’s not the right strategy.”
Tight lockdowns, which strained the Atlantic economy, simply don’t make sense at a time when virus-related hospitalizations in the region remain low, thanks to high vaccination rates that may have lessened Omicron’s impact on public health, she said.
But it would be a mistake to assume the COVID-Zero approach was undermined solely by Omicron’s lightning-fast spread, says Colin Furness, an infection control epidemiologist at the University of Toronto.
It’s important to remember that one of the key pillars of the strategy, the Atlantic Bubble, was largely abandoned across the region in November 2020, Furness said in an interview. The novel policy allowed the region’s residents to travel between the four provinces, but it imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for visitors from outside the region, a move that kept travel-related infections in check.
Each of the Atlantic provinces maintained their own travel restrictions after the bubble burst, but most of those measures have been changed as the pandemic evolved and vaccination rates rose.
Furness said travel restrictions remain an effective means of controlling the spread of contagious viruses.
But Kirkland said the Atlantic Bubble was not sustainable.
“We had the Atlantic Bubble, and it was very effective in the first wave of the pandemic, but this is part of learning to live with the pandemic,” she said. “We can’t isolate ourselves from the world forever .... For us in the Atlantic region, it’s been hard for us to adapt because we’ve been so vigilant.”
That sense of vigilance, however, slipped in July 2021 when the region’s consistent public messaging on COVID-19 was essentially scuttled by New Brunswick. Premier Blaine Higgs decided his province would be the first in the region to lift all health-protection orders, including mask-wearing requirements.
“New Brunswick broke from the pack,” Furness said, adding that vaccination rates in the province also slowed to a crawl. “That really fractured the region.”
By late September, the resulting surge in Delta variant infections and hospitalizations prompted Higgs to impose so-called circuit-breaker lockdowns that were extended in October. A senior provincial health official later admitted that the decision to lift all restrictions was a mistake.
“Now, (the Atlantic region) has a real uphill battle,” Furness said. “You’ve squandered all the social capital you have.”
During the past 14 days, Atlantic Canada’s per capita infection rate has been below the national average, but it was higher than every other province and territory, except Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba, according to federal figures.
3:15 p.m. As Saskatchewan welcomed students back to in-person learning this week, Dr. Ayisha Kurji sat her grade-schoolers down to discuss ways to keep them as safe as possible from COVID-19.
Some parents in Saskatchewan — the only province to not delay classes after the holiday break — chose to keep their kids home but Kurji sent hers back, feeling confident her family had done its best to shield against an Omicron-fuelled surge that has shuttered most schools across Canada.
“We need to recognize that kids have paid a huge price in the pandemic and we see the impact that’s had on them,” said the pediatrician and assistant professor at the University of Saskatchewan, who ensured each of her kids had received two COVID-19 vaccine shots before school resumed.
“Now that we have that information, we really do need to put our kids first. (But) we need to make sure it’s safe to go back to school.”
Debate persists over the role schools have played in COVID-19 transmission, and strategies vary coast-to-coast over whether to offer in-person learning or virtual classes, and for how long.
3:10 p.m. Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole says those unwilling to be vaccinated against COVID-19 should be accommodated through measures like rapid testing, as health experts warn the lightning-fast spread of the Omicron variant threatens to overwhelm hospitals.
O’Toole came out as opposed to vaccine mandates during last year’s election campaign and today accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of fuelling vaccine hesitancy by attacking those who haven’t received their shot.
Trudeau on Wednesday said Canadians are angry at those who refuse to be vaccinated because they are filling up hospital beds, causing cancer treatments and elective surgeries to be put off.
The Conservative leader says he refuses to criticize people who aren’t vaccinated and believes “reasonable accommodations” should be provided to those who work in the trucking industry in order to avoid service disruptions.
3 p.m. Nunavut will no longer offer lab-confirmed testing for communities with COVID-19 to free up health-care resources.
Chief public health officer Dr. Michael Patterson says that means Nunavut’s case counts will no longer reflect the total number of infections.
Laboratory PCR tests will only be used to confirm COVID-19 in communities without previous cases and for people and staff in high-risk settings, including long-term care and front-line health workers.
Patterson says rapid testing will be used in the territory and shipments of the kits are to arrive in Nunavut in the coming days.
There are 244 cases of COVID-19 in Nunavut spread over 12 communities, the territory’s largest outbreak to date.
Health minister John Main says he expects COVID-19 to be in all of Nunavut’s 25 communities by the end of the month.
2:45 p.m. Newfoundland and Labrador is extending online learning for schoolchildren until at least Jan. 14.
Officials said today they would update parents and children on the situation no later than next Thursday.
The Education Department says it is co-ordinating with school districts to deliver COVID-19 rapid tests to schools.
Health officials are reporting 503 new cases of COVID-19 today and say there are 4,059 active infections across the province.
Officials say all the newly reported infections are under investigation and contact tracing is underway.
There are four people in hospital with the disease.
2:30 p.m. Health officials in New Brunswick are today reporting an increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations and one more death related to the novel coronavirus.
A person in their 30s in the Fredericton region is the 169th in the province to die as a result of COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic.
Officials say there are 63 people hospitalized — an increase of four from a day earlier — with 19 patients in intensive care, a rise of three.
Officials say of those in hospital, 46 are over the age of 60 and 11 people are on a ventilator.
The province reported 672 new cases of COVID-19, but chief medical officer of health Dr. Jennifer Russell has said the number of PCR-confirmed cases no longer reflects the severity of the situation in the province.
Today’s statement says “hundreds” of health-care workers continue to isolate at home due to the virus, but it doesn’t give a specific number. On Tuesday, officials said 571 health-care workers were isolating.
2:20 p.m. Transat A.T. is cancelling nearly 30 per cent of its winter flights as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc on air industry plans and profits.
The tour operator says the ongoing impact of the Omicron variant and the federal government’s Dec. 15 recommendation against non-essential travel abroad have triggered a wave of trip cancellations.
The slimmed-down flight schedule is in place from today through Feb. 25, though Transat says more changes may be necessary.
The Montreal-based company, which did not specify which routes were affected, says customers will be fully refunded and, where possible, offered rebooked reservations as an alternative.
The move comes a week after WestJet Airlines Ltd. cut 15 per cent of its scheduled flights through to the end of January, citing a high proportion of flight crews calling in sick due to Omicron.
The airline sector, which had begun to recover following a devastating first year of the pandemic, is struggling once again amid the COVID-19 surge, with Air Canada cancelling hundreds of flights so far this month and U.S. carriers scrapping thousands.
2:15 p.m. Cineplex Inc. says it has temporarily laid off nearly 5,000 part-time employees because of mandated closures of its Ontario movie theatres to tackle the surge of the Omicron variant.
Spokeswoman Sarah Van Lange says Canada’s largest movie chain will get its employees back to work “once and for all” as soon as the restrictions are lifted.
New COVID-19 public health measures announced by Ontario Premier Doug Ford on Monday resulted in the closure of 67 Cineplex theatres along with indoor concert venues, museums, galleries and other attractions.
The provincial restrictions also require restaurants and bars to halt indoor dining and cease selling alcohol after 10 p.m.
The policies meant to curtail the province’s soaring COVID-19 cases are expected to remain in place until at least Jan. 26.
The Toronto-based company said it would offer full refunds to customers who had booked tickets in advance.
2 p.m. The Ontario government says it’s accelerating booster shots for school and child-care staff to protect children, staff and families from COVID-19.
In a written statement, Education Minister Stephen Lecce says starting Friday, child-care and school staff in the Greater Toronto Hamilton Area will have “planned access to vaccines” at the International Centre in Mississauga, Ont.
He notes the clinic will support priority booking for education staff, including educators, custodial staff, administrative staff, school bus drivers and child-care staff.
Lecce says the government will work with all other public health units to set up more clinics across Ontario.
1:52 p.m. The union for federal correctional officers says four prisons in Quebec are “very close” to experiencing staff shortages, as more workers test positive for COVID-19.
“We’re very close to it but we’re not there yet. And I hope we won’t go there,” said Mario Guilmette, Quebec region vice-president of the Union of Canadian Correctional Officers.
Guilmette has said Correctional Service Canada is working on a protocol to be used if the province’s federal prisons hit staffing shortages. The protocol would mean workers who are considered close contacts of someone who tested positive for COVID-19 may be asked to come back to work after isolating for eight days instead of 10.
The union said the four Quebec prisons at risk of staff shortages are La Macaza Institution, Donnacona Institution, Joliette Institution for Women and the Regional Reception Centre.
1:30 p.m. Nova Scotia health officials say the province is in talks with the federal government to secure help for the COVID-19 booster vaccine roll-out.
Health Department spokesperson Marla MacInnis confirmed Thursday in an email the province has sent a request to Ottawa for resources, but she didn’t specify.
MacInnis says details need to be finalized, but she says the province expects help from the Canadian Red Cross.
Officials said Wednesday new booster dose vaccine clinics across the province would begin scheduling appointments today.
Earlier this week, the province dropped the age of eligibility for booster shots to residents 30 years and older.
1:20 p.m. The city is stepping up efforts to get more education workers and students vaccinated over the coming days to help ensure that schools reopen for in-class learning as scheduled by the province on Jan. 17, said Toronto Mayor John Tory on Thursday.
Four vaccination clinics, with appointments specifically for education workers, will be held in two city-run immunization clinics this Sunday and on Jan. 16, said Tory, speaking at a press conference.
“This effort will help more than 3,500 education workers get vaccinated as soon as possible,” said Tory.

1 p.m. Quebec will require people to show proof of vaccination against COVID-19 to enter liquor and cannabis stores starting Jan. 18, as a way to coerce unvaccinated people to get their first doses, Health Minister Christian Dubé said Thursday.
Dubé said he only introduced new rules for liquor and pot stores because they are owned and operated by the provincial government, adding that he would soon announce more services and businesses for which the vaccine passport would apply, following consultations with various sectors. He hinted at limiting access to shopping malls and personal care salons.
“If they won’t protect themselves, we’ll protect them from themselves,” Dubé told reporters in Montreal, referring to people who haven’t had a single dose of COVID-19 vaccine. He said unvaccinated people represent about 10 per cent of Quebec adults but account for about 50 per cent of COVID-19 intensive care patients.
12:30 p.m. Toronto Public Health has released new COVID-19 screening guidelines for school and child care settings in line with recent policy changes announced by the province . The new screening questionnaire and isolation guidelines can be viewed here .
The key changes for parents to note are the following:

- a runny nose is once again a symptom being screened for, but only if it exists in combination with at least one other secondary symptom, such as sore throat, headache, tiredness, muscle aches, and nausea, vomiting or diarrhea;



- if a child is notified as a close contact of someone who has COVID-19, they no longer need to self-isolate if they are fully vaccinated or under 12 years old and do not have any symptoms themselves;



- a child with COVID-19 symptoms does not require a negative test to return to school/daycare, but they do need to self-isolate for at least five days (longer if their symptoms persist) if they are fully vaccinated and at least 10 days if they are not fully vaccinated or immunocompromised.


11:30 a.m. Ontario’s long-term care minister says COVID-19 outbreaks are hitting homes in almost all public health units, with staff absences of between 20 and 30 per cent in some areas.
Rod Phillips says there are currently outbreaks reported in 186 homes in 30 of the province’s 34 public health units.
He says he expects the number will continue to rise with the highly contagious Omicron variant spreading in communities at record levels.
Phillips says staff absence rates range from 20 to 30 per cent in some of the hardest-hit areas and the ministry is in contact daily with homes that are struggling.
He says staffing is a concern, but the long-term-care sector is affected differently than hospitals, which deal with new admissions while short-staffed due to virus exposures and infections.
11:22 a.m. Toronto is focused on getting more education workers and students vaccinated over the coming days, in order to help ensure schools re-open Jan. 17 as planned, says Mayor John Tory in a Thursday presser.
Four vaccination clinics with appointments specifically for education workers will be held in two city-run immunization clinics, says Tory.
More than 27 clinics, including 22 TPH clinics are planned in schools over the next two weeks to help students, their families and education workers get vaccinated. TPH is also redeploying staff from other areas to work on additional school based clinics.
In order to cover the growing number of staff absences due to COVID-19, the city is redeploying staff from departments that have been closed or scaled down to essential services, including vaccination clinics, city shelters and LTC homes, Tory says.
Medical Officer of Health Dr. Eileen de Villa says research has shown that the new Omicron variant is 4.5 times more contagious than the Delta variant, which was more contagious than the original variant.
10:43 a.m. U.S. public health advisers said vaccinated teens should get a COVID-19 booster shot from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, an important step in efforts to expand immunizations and keep schools open.
The panel of outside experts convened by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted to 13 to 1 to recommend the booster shot for people ages 12 to 17 who received their second dose at least five months earlier. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky endorsed the recommendation, making it official.
The agency’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices met following Monday’s emergency clearance of the third shot by the Food and Drug Administration. Immunization and boosters are gaining importance as the highly transmissible omicron variant has quickly overtaken delta to become the dominant strain in the U.S. While Omicron appears to cause less serious disease, the sheer numbers of patients pose a burden to hospitals and health workers.
10:20 a.m. Ontario reporting 2,279 people hospitalized with COVID-19 and 319 people in the ICU; at least 13,339 new cases and 20 deaths.
In Ontario, over 195,000 doses were administered yesterday. In Ontario, over 195,000 doses were administered yesterday. The seven-day rolling average of COVID-19 related patients in ICU is 252; 91.0 per cent of Ontarians 12+ have one dose and 88.3 per cent have two doses, according to Health Minister Christine Elliott.
The seven-day rolling average of COVID-19 related patients in ICU is 252.
10 a.m. Austria’s government announced new measures Thursday to slow down the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant in the Alpine country.
“We have to adjust to a new situation with omicron, we have to adjust to the fact that the infection numbers will increase quickly,” Chancellor Karl Nehammer told reporters in Vienna.
Existing measures such as banning the unvaccinated from many stores and cultural venues will be more strictly implemented as of next week, and the use of masks — FFP2 or K95 types — outdoors will be made mandatory if a distance from other people of at least two meters cannot be met. The government also called on Austrians to keep working from home if possible. At the same time it will reduce the quarantine period to five days if a negative test result can be presented.
9:30 a.m . MiWay is temporarily suspending some service in response to an increasing number of staff that are currently absent due to COVID-19.
Starting Friday, MiWay will be suspending service on Routes 101/101A Dundas Express and 107 Malton Express, as well as reducing service frequency on Route 103 Hurontario Express in response to Transit Operator staff shortages due to COVID-19 and self-isolation requirements. These reductions will be in effect until further notice.
8:50 a.m. The Ontario government is expected to provide an update Thursday on the deployment of rapid antigen COVID-19 tests in the province.
The update comes a day after the federal government said it will distribute 140 million rapid tests across the country this month, four times the amount handed out in December.
On Wednesday, a number of stricter health measures — including widespread business closures and a temporary return to online schooling — took effect in Ontario.
The province has also directed hospitals to pause non-urgent surgeries due to skyrocketing COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations.
As well, a group of hospitals in the province urged pregnant people to get vaccinated against the virus, pointing to the recent hospitalization of several infants infected with COVID-19.
Toronto’s Hospital for Sick Children, McMaster Children’s Hospital, the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario and Kingston Health Sciences Centre issued a joint statement Wednesday, saying six babies under the age of one had been admitted since mid-December.
8:40 a.m. On Thursday, the city, in partnership with Michael Garron Hospital, will begin administering a fourth COVID-19 vaccination dose to 131 eligible residents at True Davidson Acres, a long-term-care home.
This week, clinics have been scheduled for residents in five other city-operated LTC homes (Castleview Wychwood Towers, Fudger House, Kipling Acres, Wesburn Manor and Seven Oaks). Clinics at the remaining four LTC homes (Bendale Acres, Carefree Lodge, Cummer Lodge and Lakeshore Lodge) will be scheduled over the coming days.
8 a.m. Germany’s biggest governing party said Thursday that it aims for a final decision by the end of March on the introduction of a universal vaccine mandate against COVID-19.
Parliament last month approved legislation that will require staff at hospitals and nursing homes to show that they are fully vaccinated or have recovered from the coronavirus by mid-March. Progress toward a more contentious universal vaccine mandate is proving slower.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz has backed such a mandate, but wants to have lawmakers vote according to their personal conscience rather than on party lines. The idea is for parliament to vote on proposals drawn up by groups of lawmakers rather than by the government.
There are divisions on whether a universal mandate is desirable within Scholz’s three-party government, notably in the ranks of the Free Democrats, the smallest coalition partner. And it isn’t yet clear how the mandate would be designed.
7:45 a.m. France is allowing vaccinated travelers from South Africa to enter its territory without having to observe a coronavirus quarantine.
The French government published a decree Thursday that removed South Africa from the list of places subject to highly restricted travel rules.
Unvaccinated people coming from South Africa still must quarantine in France for 10 days under supervision from local authorities.
France almost completely banned travel to and from South Africa after the first COVID-19 cases involving the Omicron variant were detected in South Africa in November.
The highly contagious variant has since spread around the world, causing record daily cases in the United States and parts of Europe.
7:20 a.m. The Bahamas’ government is scrapping plans to enforce more stringent pre-arrival testing requirements among vaccinated travelers this week.
While Prime Minister Philip Davis said in late December the Bahamas would no longer accept rapid antigen pre-departure tests from vaccinated travelers starting Jan. 7, officials said Tuesday it would be suspending that requirement. Fully vaccinated travelers and those under 12 may continue to show either a negative PCR test or rapid antigen test to enter, according to a statement from the country’s Ministry of Tourism and Aviation.
Unvaccinated travelers ages 12 and older must still present a negative PCR test and cannot use rapid tests. Travelers under the age of two continue to be exempt from testing requirements.
7:07 a.m. England will soon be scrapping its pre-departure coronavirus testing mandate for fully vaccinated travelers, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced. The measure has been in place for roughly one month.
The new entry rules will go into effect 4 a.m. Friday and apply to travelers who are fully vaccinated and under 18 years old.
Those travelers will also no longer need to self-isolate upon arrival until they receive a negative PCR test on day two of their trip. Instead, England will require a lateral flow test no later than the end of day two of their visit without an isolation period. Another PCR test is mandatory only if the initial test is positive.
Johnson said pre-departure testing was meant to help slow the arrival of the new Omicron variant of COVID-19 within the U.K., but the strain is now “so prevalent, these measures are having limited impact ... while continuing to pose significant loses to our travel industry.”

6:12 a.m .: Experts say employers need to be more flexible than ever to accommodate the latest wave of remote learning, as parents are finding themselves pushed to the limit.
“The mental health of parents has been really very compromised throughout this whole pandemic,” said Paula Allen, global leader of research at human resources services and technology company LifeWorks (formerly Morneau Shepell).
For employees who have children at home, flexibility makes all the difference, said Allen.
Employers need to prioritize communicating to employees what relief options are available to them, she said, whether it’s compressed work weeks, mental health days or short-term leave — of which there’s been a massive increase.

6:10 a.m.: With gold-standard testing for COVID-19 becoming increasingly difficult to find, debate is swirling over whether a throat swab sample should be collected alongside a nose swab for at-home rapid tests — contrary to some package instructions.
For most tests, accuracy of a combined throat and nose swab has not yet been tested, and Canadian and U.S. official health guidance still advises people to follow the user instructions of the kit they have on hand.
However, debate has emerged on social media and among some experts after anecdotal evidence from people who said they only tested positive after swabbing both the back of their throat and their nasal cavity, despite test instructions to swab the nose only.

6:09 a.m.: U.S. health officials said Wednesday they are not changing the qualifications for being “fully vaccinated” against COVID-19, but they are urging Americans to stay “up to date” on their protection against the virus by getting booster shots when eligible.
The move to keep the existing definition of fully vaccinated — either two doses of the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna or a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine — comes as health officials warned of waning protections from the initial doses. They are encouraging Americans to get additional doses to stave off serious illness and death from the delta and omicron variants.
The decision to keep the initial definition, established more than a year ago when the vaccines first rolled out, means that federal vaccination mandates for travel or employment won’t require a booster dose.
Maintaining the existing definition of “fully vaccinated” could make it more difficult to encourage some Americans who only begrudgingly got their primary doses of the vaccine to get boosted, since they would not face onerous restrictions often imposed on the unvaccinated — including testing requirements or, in some jurisdictions, being barred from indoor dining and other facilities.
6:08 a.m.: California is struggling to staff hospitals and classrooms as an astonishing spike in coronavirus infections sweeps through the state.
The fast-spreading omicron variant of COVID-19 is sidelining exposed or infected health care workers even as hospital beds fill with patients and “some facilities are going to be strapped,” Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly said Wednesday.
Some 40% of hospitals are expecting to face critical staff shortages and some are reporting as much as one quarter of their staff out for virus-related reasons, said Kiyomi Burchill of the California Hospital Association.
In Fresno County, more than 300 workers at area hospitals were either isolating because of exposure or recovering, said Dan Lynch, the county’s emergency medical services director.
The Los Angeles County Fire Department is driving patients to hospitals in fire trucks rather than ambulances because 450 firefighters are absent after testing positive, acting Assistant Chief Brian Bennett told the Carson City Council on Tuesday, according the Los Angeles Daily News.
Going forward, the county Fire Department will only be sent on medical calls when absolutely necessary, officials said.
6:06 a.m.: Thailand reported its biggest spike in coronavirus cases in weeks on Thursday after a holiday season in which people travelled and gathered in large numbers amid the rapid spread of the omicron variant.
Officials recorded 5,775 new cases, prompting the Ministry of Public Health to raise the official warning level to 4 on a scale of 5, permanent secretary Kiatiphume Wongrajit said. The warning level had been at 3 since the end of December.
Under level 4, the ministry recommends closing high-risk venues, including those with poor ventilation, increasing restrictions on interprovincial travel, limiting group sizes in public places and lengthening quarantine requirements for travellers entering Thailand.
The ministry has submitted a proposal to the Center for COVID-19 Situation Administration, chaired by Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, to ramp up virus restrictions due to the jump in cases. The CCSA is to meet on Friday and is expected to make a decision on the new measures.
6:06 a.m.: Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi on Thursday asked that the U.S. military in Japan stay inside its bases to prevent the further spread of COVID-19.
Hayashi said he spoke on the phone with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and was promised utmost efforts to ensure people’s health. It was not immediately clear if a base curfew would be issued.
Maj. Thomas R. Barger, a U.S. Forces in Japan spokesperson, said he could not comment on the request, but that a team was carefully monitoring cases and trends.
Hayashi’s request came as the U.S. military is promising more stringent measures to curb spreading cases. The new measures require all personnel, even when fully vaccinated, to wear masks on base until a third negative coronavirus test, and reiterate an order for all to wear masks when off base, Barger said.
American forces have come under fire after a spike in coronavirus cases in areas where they are based in large numbers, including Okinawa and Iwakuni, both in southern Japan.
6:05 a.m.: Immunity against COVID-19 among vaccinated adult Canadians and those who have already contracted the virus has been waning throughout the population, tests on donated blood have found.
Tests on around 9,000 donated blood samples from across Canada show that antibodies in the blood which fight the virus declined in October among all age groups, with experts saying the waning immunity is likely to have continued in November and December.
But the head of the government’s COVID-19 Immunity Task Force says that the highly contagious Omicron variant may offer an “immune dividend” offering fresh protection against future infection.
Scientists on the task force are now analyzing the extent of immunity offered by Omicron, as well as “memory of immune protection” in the cells which can kick in with future COVID-19 infections.
6 a.m.: Surging cases of COVID-19 driven by the rapidly transmissible Omicron variant are pushing the health-care system to the brink and putting pressure on some police and transit services.
With 170 personnel booked off on leave related to COVID-19, the Winnipeg Police Service declared a state of emergency Wednesday and the Edmonton and Calgary police services warned of staffing challenges after a growing number of members tested positive or were in isolation.
Ontario’s GO Transit says a temporary reduction in train and bus service in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton regions is set to begin within days due to staffing shortages caused by the Omicron variant.
Federal Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos announced yesterday Ottawa will distribute 140 million rapid tests across the country this month, four times the number delivered in December.

Full text: Premier Doug Ford is facing pressure to prevent a crisis as hospital systems warn Omicron is driving up patient numbers dramatically while more and more health staff are isolating at home with symptoms.
Ontario reported its largest one-day increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations of the pandemic Wednesday, prompting opposition parties to urge the Progressive Conservative government take bolder steps to prepare for an onslaught of patients.
The New Democrats and Liberals called on Ford to request help from the Canadian Armed Forces for hospitals and nursing homes where COVID-19 outbreaks are rising sharply, act faster to accredit foreign-trained nurses and free up doctors and nurses from vaccination centres by replacing them with dentists and other injection-qualified health-care professionals.
"There are urgent steps that need to be taken to make sure that a tough situation does not become that much worse," Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca told a news conference.
NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said Ford is missing a chance to bolster the system in part by scrapping Bill 124, which capped wage increases for nurses and other public sector workers before the pandemic hit.
"There are a lot of front-line health-care workers who have walked away, who are burnt out and have left the profession. We need a strategy to get those people back."
Horwath argued against re-hiring nurses and other health-care workers terminated by some hospitals for refusing to be vaccinated, saying that would pour "gas on the fire" by increasing the risk of infection.
The number of patients in hospital with COVID-19 topped 2,000 on Wednesday. That's up about 800 from the previous day and almost triple the level of a week ago, although the number includes hundreds requiring care for other conditions but testing positive for the coronavirus.
Nevertheless, hospitals in Brampton, Etobicoke, Hamilton, Niagara, Chatham and Sarnia say they are hitting critical levels of demand. Hospitals across the province have been directed by the province to cancel up to 10,000 non-emergency surgeries a week to deal with the latest pandemic surge.
That directive is being extended to independent health clinics outside hospitals, barring them from performing non-urgent surgeries that require surgical nursing or anesthesia support or any "high-risk surgeries that could result in someone being sent to the emergency department," said Health Minister Christine Elliott's office.
Chatham-Kent Health Alliance chief executive Lori Marshall said Wednesday three COVID intensive care patients have been transferred to hospital in London and cited "the most significant demand on hospital services that we have seen ... throughout the entire pandemic."
Ford warned Monday that Ontario is facing a "tsunami" of the highly-contagious but less severe Omicron variant and hospitals could be overwhelmed by the end of the month. To deal with that, he announced a return to online learning and new restrictions including closings of indoor restaurant dining, gyms, movie theatres and other venues.
Firing back at opposition parties with just five months until the June 2 provincial election, Health Minister Christine Elliott's office said the surgery delays will free up between 1,200 and 1,500 hospital beds and noted 4,300 people, such as retired doctors or paramedics and dentists, have volunteered to serve in vaccination clinics with 1,400 sent for immunizer training to date.
There are already nurses trained abroad cleared to work in "selected high-need hospitals" to ease staffing shortages, added Elliott spokeswoman Alexandra Hilkene.
"We will continue to work with our health care and hospital partners to ensure they have the support they need and will not hesitate to take further action."
At this point, intensive care unit occupancy province-wide remains well within capacity, with 288 COVID patients - however, that number is up from 190 patients a week ago and the Ontario Hospital association said Wednesday there have been 124 adults admitted into intensive care in the last three days.
Hamilton Health Sciences chief executive Rob MacIsaac warned exponential growth in COVID cases means "we have very limited capacity to take on significant new numbers of patients."
In Sarnia, Bluewater Health said half of its ICU beds are filled with COVID pneumonia patients and five times the usual number of staff on sick leave, forcing double shifts and cancelled vacations.
"We are having end-of-life discussions with families of patients in all age categories - not just older ages," chief executive Mike Lapaine and chief of staff Dr. Mike Haddad said in a memo urging area residents to stay at home and avoid socializing.
Niagara Health System will temporarily close its Fort Erie urgent care clinic starting Thursday at 11 p.m. to "redeploy" its doctors and nurses to its hospital campuses.
"This wave of the pandemic is beyond anything that we have experienced," chief executive Lynn Guerriero said in a letter to the community that asked family doctors and primary care clinics in Fort Erie to extend their hours.
On Monday, the William Osler Health System operating the Brampton Civic and Etobicoke General hospitals declared a "code orange" because of the number of patients and was transferring more than a dozen out to hospitals in Toronto to make room for more.

Full text: An unhappy new year makes for an unpredictable election year.
Five months from now, Ontario voters will have their say on judgment day, June 2.
How will they judge Doug Ford? Will Omicron be a mere memory, or will voters be of a mind to punish the premier for the pandemic?
His Progressive Conservative government welcomed the new year by first closing schools for two days, then two weeks. Times change, but in politics as in pandemics, timing is everything.
Will people fault Ford's Tories for vacillating and oscillating? Or will they grudgingly go along - better safer than sorrier, even if angrier?
Here's another question: How will they judge others?
Will the NDP's Andrea Horwath be seen as premier-in-waiting after 13 years of waiting? The implosion of Ontario's Liberal dynasty in 2018 crowned Ford premier by default, and elevated Horwath - or more precisely, limited her - to leader of the Official Opposition.
Will it be her time, after all this time? After finding her wanting four years ago, will voters now find her fitting in hard times - asking the tough questions about school closings while in opposition but ready to make the tough decisions about school closings should she win power?
No matter that Horwath flitted and flipped and flopped over vaccination mandates just a few months ago. Never mind that she one day sided with a few vocal anti-vax (or vax-agnostic) unionists, then reversed herself the next day when more enlightened union leaders (and fellow New Democrats) remonstrated with her.
Times change, and full credit to Horwath for changing her mind. In the NDP's defence, it has been consistent in calling on PC and Liberal governments to shore up an under-resourced health-care system that runs too close to capacity. (Remember when a bad flu season gave us hallway medicine, even pre-pandemic?)
And what of Steven Del Duca, the little-known leader of Ontario's Liberal party? (It is instructive that nearly two years after being inducted, Del Duca is still introduced as "little-known.") It can be hard to make your mark when your time as leader is marked by the rise of COVID-19, but it is not for want of trying - Del Duca attacks Ford for closing schools one day, and accuses him of a "coverup" the next (for reduced access to COVID testing).
Opposition politicians, like columnists, point fingers at government for doing too little (Lock down!), then wag fingers at government for doing too much (Open schools!), then beat their chests either way (Told you so!). It is hard to fathom a gloomier time in peacetime - a new year with the same old fear, continual change and endless uncertainty amid know-it-all certainty.
But a little context goes a long way to explain the complexity of COVID-19, even if oversimplifying and overestimating the consequences sounds more compelling. The novel coronavirus keeps mutating, so is it any wonder that the responses keep changing?
Epidemiological projections have often been off the mark, and the early success stories have become today's tales of woe - the zero-COVID-19 strategies of New Zealand and Australia are faltering amid Omicron's omnipresence. Unlike its precursors, the latest variant of concern is less cause for concern for the fully vaccinated - on average - because it's less likely to lurk in your lungs.
But the unvaccinated are unprotected, and thus more predominant in hospitals - less for intensive care and more for oxygen and an overnight stay. And so the numbers keep growing here as they do globally.
It is less a question of catastrophe than capacity, and it is more about hospital staff than beds. It is an unfortunate paradox of the pandemic that by enforcing super-safe quarantine and isolation protocols, we are falling short on human resources.
After watching airlines cancel flights by the thousands as crews booked off sick, is it any wonder that the rest of the economy is now short-staffed - and that hospital personnel are no less vulnerable to no-shows? That is the same crisis everyone is facing everywhere, which is one reason Ontario's government - alongside other provinces and countries around the world - has been adapting from week to week.
Improvisation is not inconsistency nor inconstancy. A two-day delay in reopening schools so that they could regroup seemed sensible last week, but a two-week shift to online learning to provide a circuit-breaker during a capacity crunch is also defensible this week - given the predictions of massive absenteeism by affected teachers.
The idea that there is only one right answer all the time is wrong-headed in a pandemic. Countering COVID-19 entails trial and error, from one jurisdiction to another.
Compared to other provinces, and especially large jurisdictions, Ontario's performance and parameters hardly resemble the rudderless or sinking ship that some suggest. It led the other provinces in providing third shots for all adults, which stoked massive lineups, but also motivated many who would not otherwise have bothered to get boosted.
Ford's governing style is erratic at best, seat of the pants at worst, in good times and bad. But the province is not a one-man band - it includes a public health apparatus led by medical doctors across the province, and a science table of expert advisers.
The premier is the point person in this pandemic, and he is prone to pivot. Voters will judge him, in five months, as they will his rivals.

Full text: What happened?
That question, more than any other, is being asked by frustrated parents, students, teachers, restaurateurs and other business owners in the wake of Premier Doug Ford's Omicron U-turn.
Last Thursday, at the premier's behest, chief medical officer of health Dr. Kieran Moore assured Ontarians that schools would reopen for in-person learning this week despite the surge in COVID-19 cases due to the contagious new variant.
But within hours of that announcement, Ford was inundated with calls from hospital CEOs, labour leaders, corporate presidents and public health officials, warning that Omicron was contributing to mass absenteeism, which threatened to disrupt the province's labour force.
By Monday - just four days after Moore's assurances and two days before schools were to reopen - the premier delivered the grim news that virtual learning would continue until at least Jan. 17 and restaurants, bars, gyms and many other businesses would be required to close indoor services until Jan. 26.
Those moves have, by Ford's own admission, left Ontarians feeling confused and angry.
Interviews with sources privy to the whirlwind of changing decisions suggest that things moved faster than most - even the advisory science table - had predicted.
"The cold, hard reality is that we're not in charge. The virus is in charge," said one senior government official who, like other Progressive Conservative insiders interviewed for this story, spoke confidentially in order to discuss internal deliberations.
"We're not doing this because we want to do it. We're doing this because we have to. We have a real problem on staffing (in health care and throughout the economy)."
On Sunday - after a phone call with Steini Brown, co-chair of the science table and dean of the Dalla Lana School of Public Health - Ford convened a virtual cabinet meeting.
"Steini described our view that hospital capacity could be overwhelmed if we didn't limit contacts, but that we could protect the health-care system with measures that limited contacts," confirmed Robert Steiner, communications director of the science table, a panel of doctors, scientists, and epidemiologists that advises the government.
"This view was largely in line with our previously released modelling - and was in line with what the premier and the minister announced at their press conference (Monday)," said Steiner, adding updated projections would be released soon.
Two weeks earlier, on Dec. 16, the science table had forecast that without additional "circuit breakers" to drive down the spread of the coronavirus, there could be 600 COVID-19 patients in hospital intensive care units by Dec. 31, putting a strain on Ontario's health system. As it turned out, there were 205 people in ICUs that day and the modelling underestimated case counts, which were far higher than projected.
That's because the modelling - which Ford accepted and used to justify some restrictions - assumed Omicron is as virulent as the less contagious Delta variant, though recent evidence suggests that's not the case.
"We've never faced an enemy like Omicron, given how quickly it spreads," the premier said on Dec. 18, conceding at the time it was too soon to say if schools could reopen on schedule.
"We need to do everything we can to slow its spread as we continue to dramatically ramp up capacity to get as many booster shots into arms as possible. Doing so is the best way to safeguard our hospital and intensive care units."
Dr. Peter Jüni, scientific director of the science table, hailed those initial restrictions as "absolutely going in the right direction."
But Omicron cases accelerated faster than anyone advising the government predicted - though a new study by Moore found the risk of hospitalization or death is 54 per cent lower than Delta.
"We're bracing for impact. Based on a real-world experience here in Ontario, the evidence tells us that about one per cent of people who get Omicron will end up in the hospital," Ford told Ontarians Monday.
That was the same message he delivered in Sunday's hour-long cabinet meeting, which participants confide was far more focused than the two-day marathon discussion last April that led to the almost-immediately abandoned scheme for police spot checks and playground closures.
"There was no one slamming down their phone and saying 'f--- this' like (last spring) during Delta," said one insider.
"The premier presented this to us as a fait accompli," the source said, adding that Ford provided no materials in support of his case. "He said he had verbal briefings with Dr. Brown and Dr. Moore and they felt we had to do this and he agreed. We debated and it got fairly heated, but nothing like (the April confab)."
"And that's because if we've learned one thing from the pandemic, it's that Ontarians want us to err on the side of caution."
But the one per cent Omicron hospitalization rate that Ford cited behind closed doors to cabinet and in public is higher than many estimates. Research in the U.K. and elsewhere, show hospitalization from Omicron is far lower than Delta with perhaps a 0.2 per cent rate of admission to hospital.
"Even if it is 0.2 per cent, that's a lot when you have hundreds of thousands of Omicron cases swamping hospitals," said another senior government official, defending the premier's comments. "We can't risk that."
Indeed, some around Ford had been urging action a week before the science table's Dec. 16 modelling.
"We wanted to shut down school for kids six and under on Dec. 10 - the kids can miss secret Santa week when they're just playing and report cards have gone out - and have them come back a week later after Christmas (on Jan. 10)," said a third insider.
"That would have given us a full month and we know we had 1,744 outbreaks in schools at the time."
But Ford, Moore and some advisers disagreed.
"The (chief medical officer of health) said that wasn't necessary and the premier took that advice. We should have closed schools before Christmas."
That reluctance stems from the criticism Ford and Education Minister Stephen Lecce faced for earlier school shutdowns. Students in Ontario have missed more in-class learning over the 22 pandemic months than anywhere in North America.
At Sunday's meeting, ministers were told there was no choice but to act because schools might see 20 to 25 per cent of staff calling in sick due to Omicron.
"It would have been chaos if one by one boards were shutting down schools due to absenteeism. If teachers or kids get sick and staffing shortages force more people into crowded classrooms, that's a lose-lose for everyone," said another source.
Against this alarming backdrop, there is some hope.
"We know the vaccines work so we could see high schools reopening for fully vaccinated students on Jan. 17. With elementary schools, it might be a bit longer. Parents will be unhappy, but, again, we have to be safe," said a fifth source, noting more eligible children between the ages of five and 12 still need their shots.
On Monday, Moore underscored that things should improve by the end of the month.
"Ontarians and all key decision makers should be monitoring the hospitalization rates that will ascend fairly rapidly over the coming weeks," the top doctor said.
"We anticipate that it'll reach its maximum by the end of January and then start to descend. So we anticipate a very short, quick and rapid approach to this epidemic and impact on the health-care system," he said.
"That is why these measures are timely, they're proportionate to the risk. They should diminish the burden on the health-care system. They should buy us time ..."
With an election set for June 2, many Conservatives - including Ford - are mindful of the optics of a government announcing one thing on a Thursday then doing the opposite the following Monday.
"I know this isn't the news anyone wants to hear, but with the new variant, the ground is shifting every single day," the premier said.
"These decisions will disappoint people, they will confuse some people and they will anger some people. I understand all those reactions. As premier, these are the hardest decisions I make, but we follow the data and the fact is this Omicron spreads like wildfire."

Full text: The Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba is hoping to score a win in the Fort Whyte byelection with a star candidate: former Winnipeg Blue Bombers offensive lineman turned restaurateur Ibrahim (Obby) Khan.
The owner of Shawarma Khan and founder of online marketplace goodlocal.ca announced his candidacy in a news release. On the phone Wednesday, Khan was enthusiastic about running for the seat formerly held by premier Brian Pallister (who resigned from the legislature in October).
The Tory candidate is up against some high-profile competitors: Willard Reaves (another former Blue Bombers player) for the Liberals, and former Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra executive director Trudy Schroeder for the NDP.
"I love competition," Khan said in an interview. "It brings the best out of me."
The Fort Whyte resident said he's a team player who has helped other small-business owners weather the COVID-19 pandemic, adding he's a cheerleader for Manitoba's first female premier, Heather Stefanson.
He is seeking to be the first Muslim MLA to represent the diverse southwest Winnipeg riding that has been held by the PCs since its creation in 1999. The date of the byelection has yet to be declared.
"The PC Party of Manitoba is in the process of preparing to receive applications from potential candidates for the Fort Whyte nomination. When details around the nomination process have been finalized, this information will be made public," the party said in Wednesday night statement.
Despite its low-energy statement, a high-profile Winnipeg candidate announcement couldn't have come at a better time for the PCs, said Brandon University political science Prof. Kelly Saunders.
"I think the party could use some good news right about now," she said. "It's an excuse to kind of rally the troops, so to speak, to generate some interest in - some momentum within - the party."
The Legislative Assembly Act says a byelection must be held within 180 days of a seat becoming vacant.
"The people of Fort Whyte deserve to have representation, especially at this perilous time," veteran political analyst Paul Thomas said.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, major policy decisions are being made concerning the health, education and economic well-being of Manitobans, the University of Manitoba political studies professor emeritus said.
"They shouldn't be disqualified from having a voice in the proceedings of government for too long."
Under the rules of the act, the latest possible Fort Whyte byelection date would be March 29.
Elections Manitoba is already advertising for workers to staff it. Approximately 150 are required for a byelection, including returning officer, assistant returning officer, office staff, as well as voting officers and information officers to work at polling places.
A byelection will also need to be called by June 7 for Thompson, as its MLA, Danielle Adams of the NDP, died in a highway crash in December.
Thomas said he doesn't expect an early call for the northern electoral division. "Political parties deserve a reasonable amount of time in order to organize themselves and find a candidate that's credible and will serve the party cause well."
Meantime, Stefanson needs to shuffle the cabinet she inherited from Pallister and make sure her team is battle-ready for the 2023 general election, said Saunders. To hold on to government, the Tory leader needs to set her own course and do it quick, she said.
"She needs to get some fresh faces in place or at least in different portfolios, and she's got to try to reset and turn this ship around a little bit more because she's not winning new voters."
A recent Free Press -Probe Research poll showed the NDP with 42 per cent support provincially, compared to 37 per cent for the PCs. In Winnipeg, home to 32 of the province's 57 constituencies, the NDP had 50 per cent support, compared to 27 per cent for the Tories.
"She needs to win those suburban Winnipeg voters, and she needs to grow the vote base - and that's not going to happen with this status quo cabinet in the status quo approach," Saunders said. "She needs to do something different."
Stefanson promised a cabinet shuffle in the new year, but with the impact of the Omicron variant on schools, public safety, health care and the economy, she might hold off for the time being, said Thomas.
"We are between New Year's (Day) and spring session of a legislature and you've got a serious emergency on your hands... So, how do you plan your agenda?" he said.
"They have to ask themselves... Do we want to do a cabinet shuffle that overlaps with the the staging of two byelections or even one byelection? What headlines do we want to get to gain for the party as we try to rebuild the brand in anticipation of an election within the next year?" Thomas said.
"Somebody in the backroom is doing that thinking."

Full text: An unhappy new year makes for an unpredictable election year.
Five months from now, Ontario voters will have their say on judgment day, June 2.
How will they judge Doug Ford? Will Omicron be a mere memory, or will voters be of a mind to punish the premier for the pandemic?
His Progressive Conservative government welcomed the new year by first closing schools for two days, then two weeks. Times change, but in politics as in pandemics, timing is everything.
Will people fault Ford’s Tories for vacillating and oscillating? Or will they grudgingly go along — better safer than sorrier, even if angrier?
Here’s another question: How will they judge others?
Will the NDP’s Andrea Horwath be seen as premier-in-waiting after 13 years of waiting? The implosion of Ontario’s Liberal dynasty in 2018 crowned Ford premier by default, and elevated Horwath — or more precisely, limited her — to leader of the Official Opposition.
Will it be her time, after all this time? After finding her wanting four years ago, will voters now find her fitting in hard times — asking the tough questions about school closings while in opposition but ready to make the tough decisions about school closings should she win power?
No matter that Horwath flitted and flipped and flopped over vaccination mandates just a few months ago. Never mind that she one day sided with a few vocal anti-vax (or vax-agnostic) unionists, then reversed herself the next day when more enlightened union leaders (and fellow New Democrats) remonstrated with her.
Times change, and full credit to Horwath for changing her mind. In the NDP’s defence, it has been consistent in calling on PC and Liberal governments to shore up an under-resourced health-care system that runs too close to capacity. (Remember when a bad flu season gave us hallway medicine, even pre-pandemic?)
And what of Steven Del Duca, the little-known leader of Ontario’s Liberal party? (It is instructive that nearly two years after being inducted, Del Duca is still introduced as “little-known.”) It can be hard to make your mark when your time as leader is marked by the rise of COVID-19, but it is not for want of trying — Del Duca attacks Ford for closing schools one day, and accuses him of a “coverup” the next (for reduced access to COVID testing).
Opposition politicians, like columnists, point fingers at government for doing too little (Lock down!), then wag fingers at government for doing too much (Open schools!), then beat their chests either way (Told you so!). It is hard to fathom a gloomier time in peacetime — a new year with the same old fear, continual change and endless uncertainty amid know-it-all certainty.
But a little context goes a long way to explain the complexity of COVID-19, even if oversimplifying and overestimating the consequences sounds more compelling. The novel coronavirus keeps mutating, so is it any wonder that the responses keep changing?
Epidemiological projections have often been off the mark, and the early success stories have become today’s tales of woe — the zero-COVID-19 strategies of New Zealand and Australia are faltering amid Omicron’s omnipresence. Unlike its precursors, the latest variant of concern is less cause for concern for the fully vaccinated — on average — because it’s less likely to lurk in your lungs.
But the unvaccinated are unprotected, and thus more predominant in hospitals — relatively less for intensive care and more for oxygen and an overnight stay. And so the numbers keep growing here as they do around the world.
It is less a question of catastrophe than capacity, and it is more about hospital staff than beds. It is an unfortunate paradox of the pandemic that by enforcing super-safe quarantine and isolation protocols, we are falling short on human resources.
After watching airlines cancel flights by the thousands as crews booked off sick, is it any wonder that the rest of the economy is now short-staffed — and that hospital personnel are no less vulnerable to no-shows? That is the same crisis everyone is facing everywhere, which is one reason Ontario’s government — alongside other provinces and countries around the world — has been adapting from week to week.
Improvisation is not inconsistency nor inconstancy. A two-day delay in reopening schools so that they could regroup seemed sensible last week, but a two-week shift to online learning to provide a circuit-breaker during a capacity crunch is also defensible this week — given the predictions of massive absenteeism by affected teachers.
The idea that there is only one right answer all the time is wrong-headed in a pandemic. Countering COVID-19 entails trial and error, from one jurisdiction to another.
Compared to other provinces, and especially large jurisdictions, Ontario’s performance and parameters hardly resemble the rudderless or sinking ship that some suggest. It led the other provinces in providing third shots for all adults, which stoked massive lineups, but also motivated many who would not otherwise have bothered to get boosted.
Ford’s governing style is erratic at best, seat of the pants at worst, in good times and bad. But the province is not a one-man band — it includes a public health apparatus led by medical doctors across the province, and a science table of expert advisers.
The premier is the point person in this pandemic, and he is prone to pivot. Voters will judge him, in five months, as they will his rivals.

Full text: The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Friday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available .
7:51 p.m. Premier Jason Kenney says mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations won't happen in Alberta, despite the federal government conceding such intervention may be necessary down the road.
Kenney, in a short statement, says his government removed the power of mandatory vaccination from the law books last year and "will not revisit that decision, period."
Kenney was responding to comments from federal Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos.
Duclos told reporters mandatory vaccinations will be left up to individual provinces to decide, but it's looming as a necessary measure to preserve the health system over the long-term.
7:14 p.m. Getting kids back to school is "essential," says British Columbia's top doctor as she and the education minister laid out plans for keeping students safe while COVID-19 infections surge.
Dr. Bonnie Henry said Friday that schools need to remain open for the emotional, physical and intellectual well-being of children.
"It is always a challenge when we have more illness in our communities, how that's going to affect schools, and we've been working very hard this week to make sure that we have contingency plans in place for when its staff are ill, educators are ill, and for students," she told a news conference.
6:44 p.m. As Canada confronts climbing COVID-19 case counts, rising hospitalizations and worker shortages, there’s one measure some experts say could stave off a worsening crisis: emergency approval of Pfizer’s oral antiviral pill.
The drug, known as Paxlovid, was approved in the United States and South Korea for emergency use in late December. Several days later, regulators in the United Kingdom also gave the treatment a green light after completing a “ rigorous ” review of its effectiveness. Israel recently became one of the first nations to dispense the pills, shortly after giving it the thumbs up.
But in this country, the drug is still awaiting approval.
Read the full story from the Star’s Raisa Patel.
6:23 p.m. The priority for schools in Yukon remains on keeping students in classrooms, but the highly transmissible COVID-19 Omicron variant could force adjustments, say education and health officials.
In-class learning for Yukon students will be tested by the spread of the Omicron variant as it hits teachers, students, staff and administrators, deputy education minister Nicole Morgan said Friday.
Officials plan to keep students in classrooms as long as safely possible by, among other things, shifting resources and using targeted remote learning options, she said.
However, a switch to remote learning is not being ruled out, Morgan said during a news conference.
5:52 p.m. Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe says his position around mandated COVID-19 vaccinations remains unchanged.
He says the Saskatchewan Party government will not mandate vaccinations.
Moe says vaccinations are a personal choice and shouldn't be imposed on people by governments.
5:52 p.m. The chief of Bearskin Lake says the remote northern Ontario community is "almost at a breaking point" after half of its population tested positive for COVID-19, as he renewed his call for immediate federal help.
Chief Lefty Kamenawatamin joined other Indigenous leaders at a news conference Friday to ask ministers to send urgent aid including staff to distribute essential supplies such as food, water and wood for stoves to keep residents warm in freezing temperatures.
"We need the help now and boots on the ground," he said.
The First Nation is in a state of emergency as COVID-19 has infected 201 of its 400 residents, including elders and a nine-month-old baby. The outbreak has meant that a large proportion of the community is isolating.
5:40 p.m. Canada's health minister says he expects the country to reach a time in the COVID-19 pandemic when provinces consider implementing a broader vaccine mandate to counter rising cases.
Jean-Yves Duclos told a COVID-19 briefing on Friday that such a measure was not currently being contemplated in Canada, but his personal opinion was that the country would get there at some point.
"We know that COVID-19 will be with us for many more months to come, maybe even many years," he said in French.
5:40 p.m.: School begins for British Columbia students Monday, with the province's top doctor laying out plans for keeping children safe as COVID-19 infections surge.
Dr. Bonnie Henry says it is essential to keep schools open for the emotional, physical and intellectual well-being of children.
Education Minister Jennifer Whiteside says safety measures include virtual assemblies, visitor restrictions, staggered break times and access to three-layered masks as they navigate this wave of COVID-19.
Whiteside says school attendance will be monitored and an unusual dip will trigger a response from public health, which may include an investigation, the use of rapid tests or a temporary shift in how students learn.
Teri Mooring, the head of the BC Teachers' Federation, says she would like to see teachers prioritized for COVID-19 vaccine boosters and N95 masks available for use in schools.
Henry also told businesses to redeploy their COVID-19 safety plans to help reduce crowding and protect workers and customers while keeping their operations running through the surge.
5:24 p.m. The Victoria Police Department is preparing to move all its available officers to front-line policing duties as it anticipates staffing shortages caused by the rapid spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19.
A statement from the department says, for the first time, it is enacting a clause in its contract with its police union that allows for the potential assignment of all officers to front-line duties.
That work includes anything related to serving the public, such as traffic or crowd control, criminal investigations and arrests.
4:48 p.m. The Manitoba government has extended its COVID-19 restrictions for three weeks, but the Opposition New Democrats are calling for stricter measures to try to slow the spread of the Omicron variant.
"While these orders remain in place, we continue to take steps to improve supply and access to testing and other important initiatives that support our pandemic response and protect our health system," Health Minister Audrey Gordon said Friday in a news release.
The rules limit movie theatres, restaurants, professional sports arenas and many other venues to half capacity or 250 people, whichever is lower, and everyone must be vaccinated. There are also limits on gatherings in private homes — five guests if anyone is unvaccinated and 10 if everyone is immunized.
4:47 p.m. Nova Scotia reported 678 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday and six new outbreaks in long-term care facilities.
Health officials also reported one more death attributed to the novel coronavirus, a woman in her 80s in the central health zone.
Premier Tim Houston issued a news release offering his condolences to the woman's family.
4:46 p.m. New Brunswick will expand COVID-19 booster shots next week to residents 18 and older, as the health system prepares to face unprecedented pressure, Health Minister Dorothy Shephard said Friday.
Residents 18 and older will be able to book appointments starting Monday as long five months have passed since their second doses, Shephard said, adding that the decision to expand eligibility is an important step toward protecting New Brunswickers from the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus.
"In the coming weeks it is likely the health-care system will be tested like never before," she told reporters. "We expect that cases and hospitalizations will continue to rise. More health-care workers will be off because of COVID-19 and service reductions will be ongoing."
4:24 p.m. Three pediatricians' groups are urging the Ontario government to resume in-person learning no later than Jan. 17.
The Canadian Paediatric Society, the Pediatrics Section of the Ontario Medical Association and the Pediatricians Alliance of Ontario make the call in an open letter to Premier Doug Ford and Education Minister Stephen Lecce.
They say they understand that the Omicron variant of COVID-19 is overwhelming hospitals and governments need to take action.
But, they say, "certain decisions and measures pose a far greater risk to children and youth than the virus itself."
4:13 p.m. Premier Doug Ford hopes Ontario’s two million schoolchildren can return to in-person learning as soon as possible, but he wants to ensure “teachers are in the classroom along with the students.”
That’s why Ford is pleading with educators to get their COVID-19 booster shots and for parents to have their children vaccinated.
“We have to make sure when the kids are back in school, they can function,” he said Friday after touring a workplace booster clinic at Purolator in Etobicoke, which is administering 500 shots a day.
Read the full story from the Star’s Robert Benzie and Kristin Rushowy.
4:10 p.m. York Region is expanding COVID-19 booster doses.
People 18 years and older who received their second dose at least three months ago can book an appointment for their third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine beginning Mon., Jan. 10.
York says it is expanding eligibility for booster doses to individuals 18 years and older if at least three months (84 days) have passed since their last dose.
3:07 p.m. Health officials in Prince Edward Island are reporting 175 new cases of COVID-19 in the province today, reports The Canadian Press.
There are now 1,550 active cases of the virus on the Island, according to CP.
Two people have been hospitalized as a result of COVID-19, including one in intensive care.
There is also one person admitted to hospital for other reasons who has tested positive for COVID-19.
As of today, fully vaccinated people who test positive for COVID-19 must isolate for seven days, down from the previous 10 days, while those not vaccinated must isolate for the full 10 days.
Officials say anyone experiencing symptoms should isolate until they are able to be tested and get a negative result.
1:50 p.m. Florida reported 76,887 new COVID-19 cases on Friday, the highest daily number of the pandemic, and the number of hospital patients with the virus passed 9,000, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.
The increase in cases comes as a record 151,725 tests are being reported on average per day as of Dec. 30, the most recent data available for testing rates. The state’s average for daily cases has increased for 41 consecutive days, revised CDC data shows, reaching 56,760 as of Friday.
1:43 p.m. Canada’s health minister says he expects the country to get to a point in the COVID-19 pandemic when provinces consider implementing a broader vaccine mandate to counter rising cases, reports The Canadian Press.
Jean-Yves Duclos told a COVID-19 briefing on Friday that such a measure was not now being contemplated in Canada, but his personal opinion was that the country would get there at some point, according to CP.
“We know that COVID-19 will be with us for many more months to come, maybe even many years,” he said in French.
Given how fragile the healthcare system is in Canada and its aging population, that type of measure will be considered by provinces over the next weeks and months, while stressing that it would be their decision to make, Duclos said.
“The only way that we know to get through COVID-19, this variant and any future variant, is through vaccination,” he added in English, while noting that other measures including personal protective equipment and testing are important as well.
He also noted the high number of hospitalizations involving people who are not vaccinated.
“That’s a burden on healthcare workers, a burden on society which is very difficult to bear and for many people difficult to understand,” he said.
Canada’s chief public health officer provided a clearer picture of the impact of the Omicron variant in the country at the briefing on Friday, saying it is causing an “enormous” volume of COVID-19 cases in Canada, but severe illness is not rising at the same rate.
Dr. Theresa Tam said the average daily case count rose 65 per cent from last week, with an average of close to 42,000 cases being reported daily over the past seven days up to Wednesday.
Although testing capacity is strained in many areas of the country — meaning case numbers are underestimated — she said other indicators such as laboratory test positivity and hospitalizations are being used to measure the progress of the virus.
Tam said the portion of laboratory tests coming back positive is estimated at 29 per cent, indicating significant community transmission.
While evidence suggests the risk of hospitalization from Omicron is lower compared to Delta, the sudden acceleration of the new variant is driving a rise in hospital admissions, Tam noted.
But although current daily case counts are 400 per cent higher than the peak of the third wave in spring 2021, she said severe illness is not spiking at the same “explosive” rate.
She said an average of close to 3,650 people with COVID-19 were being treated in hospitals daily, with almost 600 in intensive care units, representing weekly increases of 91 per cent and 25 per cent respectively.
On average, 39 deaths were reported each day.
Tam is urging the seven million eligible Canadians who have not yet received a dose of COVID-19 vaccine to do so, while also calling for everyone else to get a booster shot when they can.
She also said people should limit in-person contacts to immediate household members as much as possible.
Duclos told the briefing that he spoke with provincial and territorial health ministers on Thursday and commended their continuing hard work and “difficult decisions” managing the crisis.
Many provinces have brought back strict restrictions to stem the tide of Omicron cases, with Ontario requiring children to learn from home for at least two weeks and Quebec establishing a provincewide curfew from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.
Some public health experts have urged Health Canada to speed up the approval of the Merck and Pfizer antiviral drugs for COVID-19 on an emergency basis, but Duclos would only say that he will have more to say about the department’s assessment of those treatments “in the coming weeks.”
The vast majority of Canadians have stepped up to do their part, he said, with more than eight million booster shots administered so far. He also said there will be enough doses this month for all kids aged five to 11 to receive two shots of vaccine.
1:35 p.m. Nunavut will no longer offer lab-confirmed testing for communities with COVID-19 to free up health-care resources.
Chief public health officer Dr. Michael Patterson said that means Nunavut’s case counts will no longer reflect the total number of infections.
Laboratory PCR tests will only be used to confirm COVID-19 in communities without previous cases and for people and staff in high-risk settings, including long-term care and front-line health workers.
Patterson said rapid testing will be used in the territory and shipments of the kits are to arrive in Nunavut in the coming days.
“This necessary change will reduce the risk that our health system will be overwhelmed, which will put Nunavummiut with other health conditions at risk,” he said.
1:25 p.m. The head of Canada’s largest private-sector union says the refusal by the country’s grocers to reinstate “hero pay” for employees amid an exponential rise in COVID-19 cases is “about greed, period.”
Unifor national president Jerry Dias says while front-line supermarket workers are facing the biggest risks, executives are receiving the biggest rewards.
He says top grocery bosses have received multi-million dollar bonuses as sales and profits soar during the pandemic — even as they refuse to bring back pay bumps for employees.
Yet Dias says the risk of catching COVID-19 have never been greater for retail workers as infections surge across the country.
His comments come after the federal NDP critic for economic development, MP Brian Masse, sent a letter to the heads of Canada’s biggest supermarkets this week saying workers are doing risky work and again deserve a wage premium to keep stores open and shelves stocked.
12:55 p.m. The Toronto Maple Leafs have placed forwards Mitch Marner and Pierre Engvall into the NHL’s COVID-19 protocol.
The forwards are the 16th and 17th Toronto players to enter the league’s protocol since a COVID-19 outbreak on the team started last month, but are the only two team members currently sidelined by the virus.
Seven staff members have also gone through the league’s protocol.
The positive tests come after defenceman Timothy Liljegren, the last player in isolation from the height of the initial outbreak, returned to practice Monday.
Star forward Auston Matthews tested positive for COVID-19 on a rapid antigen test Monday, but returned a negative PCR test the next day that was later confirmed and played in the Maple Leafs’ 4-2 win over visiting Edmonton on Wednesday.
12:25 p.m. The U.S. unemployment rate fell in December to a healthy 3.9 per cent — a pandemic low — even as employers added a modest 199,000 jobs, evidence that they are struggling to fill jobs with many Americans reluctant to return to the workforce.
The drop in the jobless rate, from 4.2 per cent in November, indicated that many more people found work last month. Indeed, despite the slight hiring gain reported by businesses, 651,000 more workers said they were employed in December compared with November.
Still, the data reported Friday by the Labor Department reflected the state of the job market in early December — before the spike in COVID-19 infections began to disrupt the economy. Economists have cautioned that job growth may slow in January and possibly February because of omicron cases, which have forced millions of newly infected workers to stay home and quarantine. The economy is still about 3.6 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level.
12 p.m. Hospitalizations of U.S. children under 5 with COVID-19 soared in recent weeks to the highest levels since the pandemic began, according to government data released Friday.
The worrisome trend in children too young to be vaccinated underscores the need for older kids and adults to get their shots to protect those around them, said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Since early December, as the highly contagious Omicron variant has spread furiously around the country, the hospitalization rate in these youngest children has surged to more than 4 in 100,000 youngsters.
That compares with about 1 per 100,000 for kids ages 5 to 17, according to CDC data.
11:45 a.m. Quebec is reporting 27 more deaths attributed to the coronavirus today and a nine per cent rise in COVID-19-related hospitalizations.
Health officials say there are 2,133 patients with the disease — 180 more than the prior day — after 427 people entered hospital in the past 24 hours and 247 people were discharged.
A total of 229 people are in intensive care, a rise of 22 compared with the prior day. The province is also reporting 16,176 new cases of COVID-19.
Health workers administered an additional 103,969 vaccine doses, with the vast majority of them coming in the previous 24 hours.
11 a.m. The Ontario Hockey League has postponed two games and rescheduled another due to COVID-19 protocols affecting the Saginaw Spirit.
The league postponed Saginaw’s games Friday at Sarnia and Saturday against visiting Flint. Meanwhile, Flint’s game at Sarnia has been moved up from Jan. 19 to Saturday.
The OHL has postponed 45 games so far this year due to capacity limits in Ontario and outbreaks on teams due to the spread of the highly transmissible COVID-19 Omicron variant. Some of those games have since been rescheduled.
10:45 a.m. The Ontario government is providing targeted relief for businesses and people impacted by the current public health measures aimed at blunting the spread of the Omicron variant.
“As part of this plan, the government is introducing a $10,000 grant for eligible businesses that are subject to closures under the modified Step Two of the Roadmap to Reopen and is providing additional electricity-rate relief for businesses, as well as workers and families spending more time at home,” a release from the province said.
10:12 a.m. (will be updated) Ontario reporting record 2,472 people hospitalized with COVID-19 and 338 in the ICU; at least 11,899 new cases; 43 new deaths were reported (a data catch up).
In Ontario, 91 per cent of Ontarians 12+ have one dose and 88.3 per cent have two doses; In Ontario, over 194,000 doses were administered yesterday, according to tweets from Christine Elliott.
8:20 a.m. French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday maintained on Friday his rude remarks about the country’s minority of vaccine refusers, saying he cannot accept them infringing on others’ freedom.
The 44-year-old outspoken president, who is expected to seek re-election later this year, made headlines earlier this week by using the word “emmerder” — rooted in the French word for “crap” and meaning to rile or to bug. He was talking about his strategy for pressuring vaccine refusers to get coronavirus jabs. His vulgar language dominated news broadcasts and provoked angry reactions from his political rivals.
Speaking in a news conference in Paris, Macron acknowledged the term may have upset some, but said he takes full responsibility for it.
“When some make from their freedom ... a motto, not only do they put others’ lives at risk, but they are also curtailing others’ freedom. That I cannot accept,” he said in reference to unvaccinated people. “When you are a citizen you must agree to do your civic duty.”
7:45 a.m. The Supreme Court will hear arguments Friday on the legality of two initiatives at the heart of the Biden administration’s efforts to address the coronavirus in the workplace.
The challengers — states led by Republican officials, businesses, religious groups and others — say Congress has not authorized the measures, adding that they are unnecessary and in some ways counterproductive.
The administration says that workplace safety and health care laws have given it ample authority to take bold action in the face of a lethal pandemic.
The more sweeping of the two measures, directed at businesses with 100 or more employees, would impose a vaccine-or-testing mandate on more than 84 million workers. The administration estimated that the rule would cause 22 million people to get vaccinated and prevent 250,000 hospitalizations.
7:32 a.m. Hong Kong authorities ordered about 170 people, including several officials, to be quarantined at a government facility on Friday after they attended a birthday party where two guests later tested positive for the coronavirus.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam expressed disappointment on Thursday that government officials had attended the large party during the omicron outbreak, saying it did not set a good example for the public.
Fears of a new virus cluster were sparked when the two guests tested positive. On Friday, health authorities said all guests at the Jan. 3 party would be classified as close contacts and be sent to mandatory quarantine.
The city has been racing to control the Omicron variant, with authorities locking down multiple residential buildings for mass testing and sending hundreds of people into quarantine.
About 170 guests attended the birthday party, including about nine government officials and nearly 20 lawmakers.
7:10 a.m. The heads of several Montreal homeless shelters say they’re facing a crisis, as rising staff absences due to COVID-19 threaten to disrupt services during the coldest part of winter.
There were outbreaks in 27 Montreal homeless shelters between Dec. 26 and Jan. 1, with a total of 110 staff and clients testing positive during that time, according to the local health authority in the city’s south end.
Michel Monette, the general director of CARE Montreal, says the city is “on the brink of a humanitarian crisis.”
Almost 30 per cent of his employees are currently off the job because of a positive COVID-19 test, and up to 25 per cent of shelter users have tested positive, he said in an interview Thursday. While he’s managed to keep all the shelter’s beds open for now, he says he’ll have to close dozens if the situation worsens, and he has already had to stop offering other services, including psychosocial care.
6:50 a.m.: The public health messaging is clear: stay at home if you can, especially if you’re sick. But as the Omicron variant places significant pressure on Ontario’s COVID-19 testing capacity, essential workers are facing a new challenge: how to prove they’ve caught the virus.
That struggle to find tests has sparked worries over workers’ ability to access supports — a hurdle in what experts say should be barrier-free access to sick leave and income replacement where needed.
Read the full story from the Star’s Sara Mojtehedzadeh here.
6:50 a.m.: More than a year ago, Toronto real estate broker Ara Mamourian shouldered the responsibility of making sure students at a Regent Park elementary and middle school had supplies needed to learn remotely by buying dozens of them computers.
This week, he was called on to do it again. In just over 24 hours, Mamourian managed to solicit $26,000 in donations from his network through social media posts Tuesday.
With the money, he ordered 60 refurbished Chromebook laptops for students at Regent Park’s Nelson Mandela Park Public School and is about to order 200 more for kids at Fraser Mustard Early Learning Academy, a Thorncliffe Park kindergarten.

6:45 a.m.: As the Ontario government determines how to safely get students back in classrooms, high schoolers could return earlier than children in elementary school due to their higher vaccination levels, sources told the Star.
Insiders, speaking confidentially in order to discuss internal deliberations, say Queen’s Parks wants as many of the province’s two million students as possible back to in-person classes by Jan. 17 .

6:44 a.m.: Physicians say they’re watching staffing reach critically low levels due to workers contracting COVID-19 and the number of people seeking care. It has created an environment that’s affecting COVID and non-COVID patients alike.
Omicron is not like the Delta variant, nor does the current wave resemble the first wave of the pandemic in 2020, front-line physicians say.
People are requiring intensive care less often, it appears, and vaccinated people are better protected. Symptoms are also presenting differently.

6:06 a.m.: North Korea said Friday that it would not participate in the Beijing Winter Olympics because of the coronavirus pandemic and moves by “hostile forces.”
North Korea’s no-show at the Beijing ​Games would deprive South Korea of a rare opportunity to establish official contact with the ​North. Officials from the South had hoped that the ​Olympics would provide a venue for​ official delegates from both Koreas to meet to discuss issues beyond sports.
In a letter hand-delivered Wednesday to China by the North’s ambassador, the country’s Olympic Committee and its ministry of sports wished Beijing successful Games even though “the U.S. and its vassal forces are getting evermore undisguised in their moves against China aimed at preventing the successful opening of the Olympics,” according to the North’s official Korean Central News Agency on Friday.
6:06 a.m.: Australia’s most populous state reinstated some restrictions and suspended elective surgeries on Friday as COVID-19 cases surged to another record.
New South Wales reported 38,625 new cases, prompting Premier Dominic Perrottet to announce regulations banning dancing and singing in pubs and nightclubs, and delaying non-urgent surgeries until mid-February.
Hospitalizations reached 1,738 in the state on Friday and health authorities warned that the number could spike to 4,700 or even 6,000 in a worst-case scenario within the next month. Hospitals already are under strain as around 3,800 medical professionals are in isolation after testing positive for COVID-19.
Perrottet acknowledged “it has been an incredibly challenging two years” but said the reintroduction of the protocols was “sensible and proportionate.”
6:06 a.m.: Japan approved new restrictions on Friday to curb a sharp rise in coronavirus cases in the three most affected southwestern regions of Okinawa, Yamaguchi and Hiroshima.
“Given the sudden surge in infections, the medical system runs the risk of suffering a heavy burden in the near future,” Daishiro Yamagiwa, the minister in charge of COVID-19 responses, said at a government panel meeting.
The new measures include earlier closing hours for restaurants, a ban on serving alcohol and restrictions on large-scale events. Details on these measures, which will begin Sunday and last through the end of the month, are decided at the local level and will likely vary.
Japan has undergone periods of similar restrictions over the past two years in various areas, including Tokyo. The last order for restricted activity was lifted in September.
This time, the spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant appears to be first hitting prefectures that house the U.S. military.
6:05 a.m.: Germany’s leaders are set to consider possible new restrictions and changes to quarantine rules on Friday as the new omicron variant advances quickly.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz and the country’s 16 state governors are likely to build on restrictions introduced just after Christmas that limited private gatherings to 10 people, among other things.
One measure under consideration is toughening a measure that requires people to provide proof of full vaccination or recovery to enter restaurants or bars. They could now be required to provide proof of either a booster shot or a fresh negative test.
Scholz and the governors also are expected to consider shortening required quarantine or self-isolation periods that are currently as long as 14 days, something that many other countries already have done.
6:02 a.m.: British troops were deploying Friday to hospitals in London that are struggling to cope with “exceptional” staff shortages amid the surge in COVID-19 cases fuelled by the omicron variant.
The Ministry of Defense said that it was sending some 40 military medics and 160 general duty staff to plug staffing gaps caused by National Health Service personnel who are either ill or self-isolating amid the spike in coronavirus cases in the capital.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said earlier this week he hoped the country can “ride out” the pandemic without further restrictions, even as he warned that the country faces difficult days ahead caused by the highly transmissible omicron variant.
The military deployment underscores the impact on Britain’s health service of the pandemic that infected nearly 180,000 people on Thursday alone in the country, forcing many workers to stay home.
6:02 a.m.: China’s lockdowns of big cities to fight coronavirus outbreaks are prompting concern about more disruptions to global industries after two makers of processor chips said their factories were affected.
That has added to unease about the omicron variant’s global economic impact. Analysts warn Vietnam, Thailand and other countries important to manufacturing chains might impose anti-disease measures that would delay deliveries.
“Lockdowns in China are already causing disruptions,” economists at Nomura said in a report Friday.
The Chinese economy already was cooling under pressure from unrelated official efforts to force real estate developers and other companies to reduce surging debt that fuelled China’s boom over the past two decades.
The biggest city in China’s latest lockdowns is Xi’an, a metropolis of 13 million people in the west. It is less significant as a manufacturer than Wuhan, the central city that shut down in 2020 after the first coronavirus cases were spotted there. But Xi’an has factories that make processor chips for smartphones, auto parts and other goods for global and Chinese brands.
6:02 a.m.: Statistics Canada will release its latest jobs report Friday morning.
The labour force survey for December is expected to provide a picture of how the economy was faring just before COVID-19 infections began spiking due to the Omicron variant.
The Canadian economy added 153,700 jobs in November, dropping the unemployment rate to six per cent.
Economists at CIBC expect the December jobs report to show a gain of 15,000 jobs and an unemployment rate of 6.1 per cent to close out the year.
However, the rise in COVID-19 cases and the associated public health restrictions are expected to take their toll on the economy for January.
The highly transmissible Omicron variant has fuelled record breaking COVID-19 case numbers and prompted the return of more restrictive rules across the country.
6 a.m.: Farm groups say they’re fearful the highly contagious Omicron variant could severely stress Canadian food production.
The Canadian Federation of Agriculture says the industry had a chronic labour shortage before the arrival of COVID-19.
Production at dairy farms, greenhouses, and mushroom farms could be affected if large numbers of employees need to stay home sick.
In 2020, outbreaks of COVID-19 at meat packing plants in Alberta sickened hundreds of workers and resulted in temporary plant shutdowns that left Western Canada’s beef slaughter capacity at about 25 per cent of normal.
Canadian Cattlemen’s Association president Bob Lowe says there have been no interruptions yet at meat plants this time around, but the industry is watching with fingers crossed.
6 a.m.: A pediatrician who has researched COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among parents in Canada, the United States and Israel is urging people concerned about getting their children vaccinated to talk to a health-care provider as the Omicron variant pushes cases to all-time highs.
Dr. Ran Goldman, a professor in the department of pediatrics at the University of British Columbia, said the current national vaccination rate among children aged five to 11 is too low, so parents with questions about the safety of the vaccine should get them answered through a personal connection with a pediatrician, family doctor, nurse or pharmacist.
“If those health-care providers listen first and understand what is the basis for the hesitancy, and exactly what questions parents have, they can then address this with their knowledge and expertise. This is the key and the magic, the green card, to getting parents to understand and accept vaccines,” said Goldman, who practises in Vancouver.
Goldman said past campaigns involving pediatric vaccines have shown that conversations with health-care providers are meaningful and have helped to change hesitant parents’ minds.
Data from Health Canada shows 39 per cent of kids between the ages of five and 11 have received a first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which the agency approved for that age group last November.
6 a.m.: The pressure on Ontario’s hospitals is expected to worsen in the coming weeks as more staff are forced off the job due to COVID-19 and admissions due to the virus climb, the head of the province’s hospital association said, calling it a dire situation.
Beds are filling up rapidly, with 2,279 COVID-19 patients in hospital as of Thursday, compared to 440 two weeks earlier.
And though the 300 COVID-19 patients in intensive care units pales in comparison to the peak during the third wave of the pandemic, when 900 people with the virus were in ICU, that doesn’t mean health-care workers are breathing any easier, said Anthony Dale, president of the Ontario Hospital Association.
“We still have very, very sick people. We still have a very large number of people being admitted to intensive care,” Dale said. “I don’t know where the ceiling will be.”
As of Dec. 31, when 1,144 people were hospitalized with COVID-19, Ontario Health said overall acute bed capacity – which includes ICU beds – was 20,000, and 18,000 were occupied, including just over 2,000 in intensive care.
With COVID-19 case counts continuing to mount – rising so quickly that charted on a graph, it looks like a vertical line, Dale said – it stands to reason that hospitalization rates will do the same.
6 a.m.: With COVID-19’s latest wave showing few signs of abating concerns are deepening as more and more workers in vital sectors are sidelined by the pandemic.
In Ontario where the number of COVID patients in hospital has ballooned by a factor of five in just two weeks to 2,279, numerous hospitals are reporting massive staff absences due to COVID-19 diagnoses.
Outbreaks in the province’s long-term care homes have lead to staff absences of 20 to 30 per cent in some areas as COVID’s highly infectious Omicron variant drives up case counts. Anthony Dale, president of the Ontario Hospital Association, is calling it a dire situation.
In Quebec the government says about 20,000 health-care workers are off the job after testing positive or being exposed to the virus. And four federal prisons in the province say they are now “very close” to experiencing staff shortages for the same reason.
Hospitals in New Brunswick say they too are struggling with staffing issues due to coronavirus infections.

Is it time to get the House in order?: From mysterious leaks, undrinkable water to wasted energy, there's plenty to fix at Queen's Park

Full text: It's been a fixer-upper for years.
So is it time to gut this old House?
Officials at Ontario's aging legislature think so and look longingly to Parliament Hill, where the Centre Block is getting a $5-billion, decade-long renovation to bring it up to contemporary standards.
In a building that opened in 1893, and is now better known for leaks of political secrets, they point to frequently spurting original pipes at Queen's Park, where signs warning "DO NOT DRINK TAP WATER" were placed in washrooms more than a decade ago because of lead contamination.
There's also asbestos insulation, decades of jerry-rigged and exposed wiring through offices and in the ceilings, and a wonky, ancient steam heating system that leaves some occupants huddling over space heaters (hello, blown fuses) and others rushing to open windows wide, even on frigid January days, to avoid a free sauna.
But it's the damage from flooding and other problems in the heavily retrofitted edifice that causes the most concern. The hours-long tracing of a recent pinhole leak required workers to find a shut-off valve that had been drywalled over, an effort that took opening parts of three floors and three walls. By that time, two rooms in the basement were wading pools.
"We don't want to wait until there's a catastrophe," says Ted Arnott, the veteran Progressive Conservative MPP who was elected speaker of the legislature after Premier Doug Ford's 2018 election victory.
"We need to make it safe and we need to modernize."
In November, a workman got a surprise when his foot burst through the fourth floor, sending debris into the washroom of the speaker's third-floor apartment.
"Thankfully, I wasn't in here at the time," Arnott says as he points to a patch above the sink during a tour of the building with Jelena Bajcetic, director of the legislature's precinct properties branch, clerk of the legislature Todd Decker and Minister of Legislative Affairs Paul Calandra.
They have been preparing and planning for a full renovation they hope to begin in 2025 - once an alternative location can be found and MPPs, staff, civil servants and journalists moved out, as has taken place in Ottawa with the House of Commons relocated to the recently renovated West Block.
"I'd like to see the building restored with all the modern utility that is required ... with its original look and feel," Calandra says in his west wing corner office, which is notable for its dark wooden wainscotting and trim.
"People expect the building to be maintained in a way we can be proud of," he adds during the tour, which took place in late November as word of the Omicron variant was first emerging.
There is no official cost estimate yet, but the b-word, as in billion, is being used for the job that could include reopening skylights and windows long ago covered over, restoring some original grandeur along with improving the dismal lighting in darker areas.
Although the idea of a move-everyone-out, top-to-bottom renovation pre-dates the pandemic, there are the optics of embarking on an expensive major project at a time the province has gone billions deeper into debt to finance the COVID-19 response.
"There's never a good time to start this, but right now we're going through an emergency," says New Democratic Party deputy leader John Vanthof, who acknowledges the value of preserving the building. "Right now, our focus should be on getting Ontario through this."
Nevertheless, consultants have been going through the premises cataloguing the many problems to be solved and upgrades needed to make the Pink Palace (so named for the colour of its exterior stone) ready for another century as the seat of government.
In the basement, which was never intended as more than that but now houses a cafeteria, mail room, dining room and more, thick cast iron steam pipes run under the floor. It is hot to the touch. More steam pipes run through the ceiling, with all manner of wires and cables snaking around them.
Should one of those ceiling steam pipes crack or leak, damage to the wires could put parts of the building out of commission.
"Electrical is one of the biggest issues," says Bajcetic.
While it can take a good five minutes to get lukewarm water out of a tap on the top floors, the water in the first floor west-wing washrooms is luxuriously hot.
There are questions, too, about what the building should ultimately include.
The plan is to eliminate the viceregal suite that was constructed in the late 1930s as the Depression-era government of Liberal premier Mitchell Hepburn sold off the lieutenant governor's Chorley Park residence as a cost-saving measure.
Calandra also wants every MPP to have an office within the building, instead of having some scattered in others nearby.
Green Leader Mike Schreiner says he supports a renovation but urges the government to create an all-party committee to discuss it because only parties with 12 MPPs are considered "official" - meaning the Greens and Liberals are not on the board of internal economy.
"This building should have been renovated a long time ago," he told the Star.
"We have to make it more energy-efficient. It's ridiculous how much energy this building wastes and how much money it costs us. We need to upgrade the pipes. We can't even drink the water. And while the government's talking about electric vehicles, why not have some EV charging stations?"
In the last five years, work that didn't have to wait for a full renovation has already been done.
A drainage upgrade to the foundation around the building cost $20 million, restoration of the exterior masonry and windows took another $10 million and there have been various fire safety and other upgrades costing up to $2 million.
"We could continue to do it piecemeal, but that is inefficient, takes longer and costs more," says Arnott.
"If you look down the street, most of those buildings weren't there 100 years ago," adds Decker, nodding south toward hospital row along University Avenue.
"But 100 years from now, this building will still be the provincial parliament."

U.K. is being consumed by Brexit more than COVID

Full text: When Brexit and the coronavirus blurred into a political fog engulfing the U.K. last year, at the centre of it inevitably stood the leader who has been defined by both.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson stuck to the line that his country was at a turning point, on the cusp of a return to greatness after leaving the European Union. A shortage of critical workers, supply chain disruption and a roller-coaster resurgence of virus infections were bumps in the road on the journey to his much-vaunted “Global Britain.”
As the world confronts the latest incarnation of COVID-19, the U.K. has record infections and taken another hit to the economy. But for Johnson, Brexit and the pandemic are morphing into a political demon that now risks slipping out of his control after the more radical elements of his party gained the upper hand.
One year into “going it alone,” British civil servants have been told to avoid the word Brexit. Johnson, the champion of the U.K.’s new freedoms, often looks like a moderate next to some of his more libertarian, free-market colleagues. Many pro-Brexit members of Parliament from his governing Conservative Party are now often the ones questioning his virus restrictions.
The nation, meanwhile, is having a pang of buyer’s remorse. A survey by Deltapoll published this week found that 10 per cent of Brexit voters think it’s been a success, albeit with 67 per cent of that “leave” cohort reckoning it will eventually come good. The company questioned 1,567 adults on Dec. 23-30.
Globally, the disconnection between how the U.K sees itself — exceptional, front and centre stage — versus the diminished power in the eyes of the outside world is jarring. By the time Brexit finally happened on Jan. 1 last year, many outsiders were baffled by the choice, but relieved not to have to hear about it again. The U.K., though, won’t let go.
Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in a speech in London on Dec. 8 that “Britain is the greatest country on earth” and that “it’s time to be proud of who we are and what we stand for.” Popular among rank and file Conservatives and seen as a potential rival to Johnson, Truss has taken over tetchy post-Brexit talks with the EU and advocates for a Singapore-style economy of low taxes and light regulations.
A week later, the U.K.’s trade minister, Penny Mordaunt, lectured an audience at the Carter Institute in Atlanta about Brexit. Leaving the EU “is not an event to be mourned by the international community or an act of self-harm or one that requires us to be punished,” she said. “America has a choice to make. How will you respond?”
The trouble is that President Joe Biden already gave Johnson an answer in September. He explicitly told the prime minister that a U.S.-U.K. trade deal, the one promised as the ultimate Brexit prize, was on the back burner. Erik Fossing Nielsen, who served as chief economist at Unicredit and Goldman Sachs, called Mordaunt’s speech “bonkers” and “a display of complete ignorance and a fair amount of arrogance.”
Brexit Britain still has some punch. Johnson, who almost died of COVID-19 in 2020, faces an awkward inquiry into how the country ended up with one of the world’s highest death tolls. Yet its stellar vaccine rollout has won plaudits globally and a higher proportion of people have had their booster shots than in any large economy in Europe, a critical tool in fighting Omicron.
The U.K. has also shown it can still have an impact on the global stage.
When a new nuclear-powered submarine deal between the U.S., U.K. and Australia was suddenly announced in September, Johnson presented it as evidence of that growing clout. France, which was incensed to be cut out of the military alliance, saw it as betraying the extent to which the U.K. was willing to become a vassal state of the U.S.
French diplomats also see Johnson as too ready to find scapegoats for everything that has gone wrong after Brexit.
That’s very much a tactic of the U.K. leader, said Helene von Bismarck, a historian focused on Britain’s relationship with Europe. The aim is to find “bogeymen inside and outside the country to put blame on,” she said, “keeping everyone entertained, furious and anxious and nervous so as to keep people distracted from his deficiencies.”
One thing that has distinguished post-Brexit Britain from the rest of Europe has been attitudes toward the virus. In the U.K., there is little enforcement of mask-wearing and also an aversion to curbing people’s freedom. Many in the EU have gone for much harder restrictions.
Still, the debate about more COVID restrictions is heated in the U.K., and it runs along the same ideological lines as the Brexit dispute. It’s entirely possible Johnson won’t be in power this time next year in spite of sitting on a commanding majority in Parliament. He needed opposition votes recently to pass legislation on new virus restrictions after about 100 of his MPs rebelled.
But it will be Brexit, while the making of him, that could yet prove his undoing rather than the pandemic. Michel Barnier, the EU’s Brexit negotiator, wrote in his published diary of the talks that he was struck by how Johnson didn’t appear worried about collateral damage.
His party is ruthless about turning on a prime minister when the time comes. Margaret Thatcher famously never lost an election and yet was ousted in a palace coup.
“He used to be so immune to it and nothing seemed to touch him,” said Von Bismarck. “Now that seems to be changing. It’s not going to end with Johnson.”

Full text: Premier Doug Ford is facing pressure to prevent a crisis as hospital systems warn Omicron is driving up patient numbers dramatically while more and more health staff are isolating at home with symptoms.
Ontario reported its largest one-day increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations of the pandemic Wednesday, prompting opposition parties to urge the Progressive Conservative government take bolder steps to prepare for an onslaught of patients.
The New Democrats and Liberals called on Ford to request help from the Canadian Armed Forces for hospitals and nursing homes where COVID-19 outbreaks are rising sharply, act faster to accredit foreign-trained nurses and free up doctors and nurses from vaccination centres by replacing them with dentists and other injection-qualified health-care professionals.
“There are urgent steps that need to be taken to make sure that a tough situation does not become that much worse,” Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca told a news conference.
NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said Ford is missing a chance to bolster the system in part by scrapping Bill 124, which capped wage increases for nurses and other public sector works before the pandemic hit.
“There are a lot of front-line, health-care workers who have walked away, who are burnt out and have left the profession. We need a strategy to get those people back.”
Horwath argued against re-hiring nurses and other health-care workers terminated by some hospitals for refusing to be vaccinated, saying that would pour “gas on the fire” by increasing the risk of infection.
The number of patients in hospital with COVID-19 topped 2,000 on Wednesday. That’s up about 800 from the previous day and almost triple the level of a week ago, although the number includes hundreds requiring care for other conditions but testing positive for the coronavirus.
Nevertheless, hospitals in Brampton, Etobicoke, Hamilton, Niagara, Chatham and Sarnia say they are hitting critical levels of demand. Hospitals across the province have been directed by the province to cancel up to 10,000 non-emergency surgeries a week to deal with the latest pandemic surge.
That directive is being extended to independent health clinics outside hospitals, barring them from performing non-urgent surgeries that require surgical nursing or anesthesia support or any “high-risk surgeries that could result in someone being sent to the emergency department,” said Health Minister Christine Elliott’s office.
Chatham-Kent Health Alliance chief executive Lori Marshall said Wednesday three COVID intensive care patients have been transferred to hospital in London and cited “the most significant demand on hospital services that we have seen … throughout the entire pandemic.”
Ford warned Monday that Ontario is facing a “tsunami” of the highly-contagious but less severe Omicron variant and hospitals could be overwhelmed by the end of the month. To deal with that, he announced a return to online learning and new restrictions including closures of indoor restaurant dining, gyms, movie theatres and other venues.
Firing back at opposition parties with just five months until the June 2 provincial election, Health Minister Christine Elliott’s office said the surgery delays will free up between 1,200 and 1,500 hospital beds and noted 4,300 people, such as retired doctors or paramedics and dentists, have volunteered to serve in vaccination clinics with 1,400 sent for immunizer training to date.
There are already nurses trained abroad cleared to work in “selected high-need hospitals” to ease staffing shortages, added Elliott spokeswoman Alexandra Hilkene.
“We will continue to work with our health care and hospital partners to ensure they have the support they need and will not hesitate to take further action.”
At this point, intensive care unit occupancy province-wide remains well within capacity, with 288 COVID patients — however, that number is up from 190 patients a week ago and the Ontario Hospital association said Wednesday there have been 124 adults admitted into intensive care in the last three days.
Hamilton Health Sciences chief executive Rob MacIsaac warned exponential growth in COVID cases means “we have very limited capacity to take on significant new numbers of patients.”
In Sarnia, Bluewater Health said half of its ICU beds are filled with COVID pneumonia patients and five times the usual number of staff on sick leave, forcing double shifts and cancelled vacations.
“We are having end-of-life discussions with families of patients in all age categories — not just older ages,” chief executive Mike Lapaine and chief of staff Dr. Mike Haddad said in a memo urging area residents to stay at home and avoid socializing.
Niagara Health System will temporarily close its Fort Erie urgent care clinic starting Thursday at 11 p.m. to “redeploy” its doctors and nurses to its hospital campuses.
“This wave of the pandemic is beyond anything that we have experienced,” chief executive Lynn Guerriero said in a letter to the community that asked family doctors and primary care clinics in Fort Erie to extend their hours.
On Monday, the William Osler Health System operating the Brampton Civic and Etobicoke General hospitals declared a “code orange” because of the number of patients and was transferring more than a dozen out to hospitals in Toronto to make room for more.

Full text: It’s generally understood that trying to forecast the future is not only a thankless game, but also a dangerous one.
That said, it is a pretty safe prediction that 2022 will be a pivotal one for Canada’s largest residential real estate market and the intensifying housing supply crisis that has shaped it. In the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), the “new normal” is defined by multiple offers, bidding wars, a chronic listings shortage, surging demand and soaring prices.
Seasonal variation in demand, something that historically dictated market activity, is now a thing of the past, even in Ontario’s recreational market for cottages and secondary residential markets beyond urban borders. Through November, daily showings by agents in the GTA ranged between 16,000 to 20,000. Toward the end of the month, those showings declined only because tight inventory meant there was far less to show. That imbalance is what led to a 15 per cent increase in November 2021 house prices in the GTA over the year earlier period.
It would be easy to forecast that 2022 markets will continue along this track, especially given the length of time it will take for any new housing supply to meet demand. An increase in interest rates may very well affect demand for cash-strapped would-be buyers. But there is one powerful variable that has little to do with market fundamentals and everything to do with politics that threatens to distort the resolution of an important issue at a crucial time.
In 2022, Ontario will have both provincial and municipal elections. Both will have a bearing on the long-term future of housing markets. Precampaign positioning suggests that the already testy relationship between provincial and municipal levels of government could become even more so.
During the September federal election, voter concerns about affordable housing made it a hot-button issue. While many promises were made in the heat of campaigning, one level of government could not unilaterally address such a complex and multi-jurisdictional issue. The failure to achieve meaningful collaboration between all three levels of government does not bode well for a timely resolution of such a pressing challenge.
Ontario’s Ford government has flagged a heightened focus on housing in the months leading up to a June election. The Conservatives are already polling voters on the matter while openly criticizing municipalities for stalling new building permits and impeding timely access to infrastructure for new developments. In addition to proposing a “scoring” system for the pace of permitting by cities and towns, Premier Ford also plans to convene a mayoral summit to demonstrate to municipal leaders and provincial voters that this is a top priority.
The premier’s concern is backed by the latest data from Statistics Canada. It shows the value of housing permits decreased 2.1 per cent in August to $9.7 billion, with Ontario and British Columbia declining the most.
Nevertheless, for Ontario mayors and councillors facing re-election just a few months later, this deliberately public pressure will complicate and potentially sour the relationships even further. By tagging municipal governments as the root of the housing crisis, Premier Ford may spur some action. But, at the same time, he will likely incite a defensiveness that could make collaboration more difficult at such a critical time.
Further complicating matters is that federal, provincial and municipal governments are direct financial stakeholders in the very markets they are grappling to address. Property tax represents about 32 per cent of Toronto’s operating budget, while about six per cent comes from the municipal land transfer tax. Another 30 per cent of the city’s budget comes from such housing-related user fees as water and garbage collection. About 15 per cent of Ontario’s education budget, also a voter hot button, comes from provincial property taxes.
Finally, there is the reality that affordable housing has an exceptionally high emotional quotient while cutting across issues ranging from social policy and human rights to business, economic development, urban planning, immigration strategy and, yes, politics.
As forecasts go, it is safe to predict that uncertainty about so many things we once took for granted will remain through 2022. But one thing is certain: The housing supply crisis is escalating. The sooner private and public sector forces work together on solutions, avoiding the temptation to point fingers and apportion blame, the sooner supply and demand will be rebalanced and healthy, sustainable real estate markets will be restored.

Ford's chaotic response to Omicron is squandering public trust in health authorities

Full text: Amid all the twists and turns of this terrible pandemic, now in its third calendar year, one of the most vital tools to fight it has been the credibility of public authorities.
If the public is going to follow the ever-changing rules, get their shots, and (in that over-used phrase) “do the right thing,” they have to believe that those making the decisions know what they’re doing.
On Monday, the Ford government squandered a lot of that credibility.
It asked Ontarians to accept that the public health crisis brought on by the Omicron variant had changed so drastically in the space of only four days that it warranted a dramatic about-face in policy.
Just last Thursday, the province’s chief public health officer, Dr. Kieran Moore, came out to tell parents that the reopening of schools would be delayed by only two days, until Wednesday . He assured everyone that he “absolutely” endorsed that move, that “the rest of my colleagues” in hospitals and on the provincial science advisory table were on board, and that children had already “sacrificed so much” that schools just had to stay open.
Then on Monday, a long weekend later, the same Dr. Moore and an array of ministers stood by as the premier sombrely announced that an expected “tsunami” of Omicron cases means schools must now stayed closed for the next two weeks — “at least.” Ontario will go back into a “modified Stage 2” — including a ban on indoor dining, closing of many indoor venues, and so on.
What prompted this sudden change? No one listening to the premier could be sure. It’s been obvious for weeks that Omicron was sending case numbers soaring and threatening to flood hospitals with more patients than they can handle. It was certainly obvious last Thursday when the hapless Dr. Moore sent out the message that only modest new public health steps were required.
The truth seems to be that the government was snoozing through last week. Many wondered where the premier and key ministers were when Moore made his announcement. If there’s new evidence of Omicron’s impact on the health care system that he didn’t have last Thursday, what is it? There was talk of new modelling from Public Health Ontario showing cases going off the chart, but the trends were well established before that.
There was no sign of a plan to make sure schools have a realistic shot of actually reopening in two weeks. The government is sending N95 masks for teachers and more ventilators, but the best guarantee would be a crash campaign to vaccinate all students and make sure teachers get booster shots. Nothing like that was announced.
This feels like a government in disarray, pulling in different directions and coming up with a scatter-shot approach at best.
It’s also starting to point fingers. The Star’s Rob Benzie and Kristin Rushowy cite sources who say “there is mounting frustration at the highest levels of the government with Moore, the science table, and other public health officials.”
According to this version, Ford last summer requested “a fall pandemic plan that included a booster shot rollout, expanded rapid antigen testing, anti-viral medications, and antibody testing.”
Sounds impressive. But the same sources say there was resistance “from some in the medical community” who weren’t enthusiastic about handing out boosters and doubted the usefulness of rapid tests and testing for antibodies.
From all this we can deduce that Ford doesn’t want the blame for his government’s confused and confusing response to Omicron to be pinned on him. He’d prefer us to believe that Moore and others bungled the job. There’s an election in the offing, you see.
But Ford can’t duck this one. He’s the premier, he’s responsible, and right now he’s squandering that precious resource — the credibility of public authorities.

Full text: The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Wednesday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available .
7:20 p.m.: Christie Vickers simply doesn’t know how her two daughters will make it through the next two weeks of online school.
And the York Region parent says she’s not sure how she will push them to log in for class, after the difficult year they had last year with online school, where she ended pulling them out two months early to “save their mental health.”
“My kids are not the same kids they were three years ago. They’ve kind of lost the … kidlike sparkle — the carefree sparkle,” said Vickers. “They’re stressed, they’re sad, they’re depressed. It’s not the way it should be.”
Read the full story from the Star’s Noor Javed, Alyshah Hasham and Lex Harvey.
6:38 p.m.: Alberta Education Minister Adriana LaGrange says grade school students will go back to classes Monday as planned with more medical masks and COVID-19 rapid test kits.
LaGrange says it’s important to balance the rise of the Omicron variant with health protections and the social and educational importance of in-person learning.
She says an initial shipment of extra masks and test kits will arrive at all schools no later than the end of next week.
6:35 p.m.: Many months remain in the fight against the latest wave of COVID-19, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned Canadians on Wednesday, and there will be no “magic bullet” to end it.
Vaccination campaigns, public health restrictions and virtual classrooms are all likely to be part of pandemic life for a while as the number of new cases fuelled by the virus’s Omicron variant continues to surge, Trudeau told his first news conference of 2022.
The year, he acknowledged, isn’t starting like anyone wanted, and “that’s going to continue to be the story for the coming months.”

5:40 p.m.:
5:30 p.m.: Canada has delivered about one-quarter of the direct vaccine doses it has promised to help less wealthy countries and can't say when more doses will go out the door.
In 2021, Canada promised to donate 50 million COVID-19 vaccine doses from its own contracts and at least 150 million more through financial contributions to the COVAX vaccine sharing alliance.
To date Canada has donated 12.7 million direct doses and $545 million in cash to buy 87 million more.
5:19 p.m.: Yukon's acting top doctor is advising the territory's residents that if they have symptoms of COVID-19, they should assume they have the virus without getting tested.
Dr. Catherine Elliott said Wednesday just under 5,000 rapid tests are currently available and those are needed for people who are considered high risk or have chronic health conditions.
"When a disease is mild in most people and highly transmissible, it results in many cases in the population," she said. "People with strong immunity don't need a test. They just need to slow down, stay home and take care of themselves for seven days."
4:43 p.m.: Nova Scotia is keeping schools closed an additional week and reducing isolation requirements for fully vaccinated people who test positive for COVID-19.
Schools will stay shut until Jan. 17, though online learning will start next Monday, Premier Tim Houston announced Wednesday. He said 71 schools with poor air circulation systems would be sent ventilation units and that three-ply masks would be ordered for teachers and students.
More testing kits would be also ordered, Houston said, adding that he was hopeful they would arrive by the time children are back inside classrooms.
“There will be COVID in schools,” Houston told a news conference, but he said it’s important for children to return to in-person classes. Schools are an important source of social interaction for children, he said, adding that they also provide food and warmth for some children who may not have that at home.
“The brutal reality in this province is that for some kids, school is the place where they are safest. It’s sad but it’s true.”
The Canadian Union of Public Employees issued a news release Wednesday calling for more safety measures in child-care centres. The union said child-care facilities should be equipped with N95 respirators and rapid testing kids and that capacity limits should be reduced in classrooms.
Meanwhile, public health reported 842 new infections Wednesday and said there were 45 people in hospital with the disease, including eight in intensive care. The average hospital stay for COVID-19 patients was just over five days, the department said, adding that about one-third of COVID-19 patients were unvaccinated.
4:33 p.m.: A group of Ontario hospitals is urging pregnant people to get vaccinated against COVID-19, citing a recent trend of infant hospitalizations due to the disease.
Toronto’s Hospital for Sick Children, McMaster Children’s Hospital, the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario and Kingston Health Sciences Centre made a joint statement on the issue.
The group says six babies younger than 12 months have been admitted to Hamilton and Ottawa facilities because of COVID-19 since the middle of December.
They say all infants admitted to the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa had unvaccinated mothers.
The group of hospitals say infants’ immune systems have difficulty fighting disease especially without maternal antibodies transferred during pregnancy from vaccination.
Their statement says research out of the Ottawa children’s hospital has shown no adverse pregnancy outcomes in Ontario from COVID-19 vaccines, but vaccination coverage has remained lower among pregnant people than the general population.
4:30 p.m.: Prisoner advocates are criticizing the Hamilton-Wentworth Detention Centre for failing to communicate with inmates and families amid an ongoing COVID outbreak at the Barton Street jail.
An outbreak was declared Dec. 31. As of Wednesday, it sat at 18 confirmed cases, including 17 in inmates and one in a staff member, as the highly transmissible Omicron variant continued to surge across the province.
In this latest outbreak, rumours began swirling throughout the jail about COVID cases on the fourth floor but there was no clear communication as to what was happening, said a spokesperson for the Barton Prisoner Solidarity Project, which receives calls from inmates and families daily.
“The only way prisoners knew what was happening was from hearing it from (correctional officers who were talking) and because of announcements of security changes,” Cedar Hopperton said.
Families fear the worst when, often due to lockdowns, they don’t hear from inmates for days.

4:26 p.m.: The Manitoba government is changing its COVID-19 testing process amid rising case numbers, a backlog of tests and more signs that public services are being strained by workers out sick with the novel coronavirus.
Health officials said most people who go to provincial testing sites will now be given rapid antigen tests to take home instead of a PCR test, which is considered more accurate, done on-site and completed in a lab. There will be exceptions for some people such as front-line health workers and people with weakened immune systems who show symptoms.
Most people who test positive with a rapid test at home will no longer be asked to take a PCR test to verify the finding.
“This is to preserve our laboratory testing capacity,” Dr. Jazz Atwal, deputy chief public health officer, said Wednesday.
They will isolate and follow the same rules as people officially deemed positive, but will not be counted as part of the daily tally of new cases reported by the government.
The province was completing about 4,000 tests a day and has a backlog of roughly 6,800, Atwal said.
4:25 p.m.: An intensifying labour shortage is rippling through the economy, forcing businesses to curtail operations, reduce hours and in some cases, euthanize livestock.
The situation is a result of a chronic worker shortage worsened by the crush of new COVID-19 cases forcing many into isolation.
School closures have also left some workers scrambling for child care and unable to go into work.
The result is rising employee shortages, prompting airlines to cancel flights, drugstores to close early, restaurants to shutter or move to takeout only and municipalities to warn of delayed waste collection.
At a slaughterhouse in Quebec, the worker shortage became so extreme in recent days it opted to euthanize thousands of chickens that couldn’t be processed.
Exceldor Co-operative said in a statement that rising COVID-19 infections and a significant shortage of personnel have forced the company to resort to “humane euthanasia.”
It blamed the protracted worker shortage on federal delays processing temporary foreign worker applications.
Meanwhile, some provinces have tried to ease staffing woes by shortening isolation periods, allowing people to return to work sooner.
Yet the sheer number of new daily cases caused by the highly transmissible Omicron variant continues to leave many confined to their homes and businesses struggling to remain open.
Even those that remain open are facing a scheduling nightmare as mounting unplanned absences — on top of shifting public health restrictions — make operating difficult.
“Omicron has resulted in more unplanned absences, not to mention complications from sudden government restrictions,” Retail Council of Canada spokeswoman Michelle Wasylyshen said.
A surge of people unable to work and changing public health measures “throw schedules that were often planned weeks in advance upside down,” she added.
Some businesses have responded to the disruption by drafting new plans for how to operate during the latest wave, while some must alter hours or close altogether.
4 p.m.: Dozens of anti-vaccination protesters in the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe attacked a hospital director and other medical staff following recent violent demonstrations against vaccines and COVID-19 restrictions, officials said Wednesday.
The attack occurred Tuesday outside the University Hospital Center as police tried to escort the director and other staff elsewhere for safety. The hospital said the director briefly lost consciousness and that the crowd ripped the clothes of the deputy general director and threw urine at both. The car of an executive assistant also was seriously damaged, officials said.
A health workers’ union that organized Tuesday’s demonstration and previous ones that turned violent to protest vaccine requirements and other measures told local media that members are seeking to recover lost wages after being suspended for refusing to become vaccinated as required by law.
Guadeloupe’s prefect, Alexandre Rochatte, condemned the attacks and said the government will prosecute those responsible.
“These deliberate abuses are unacceptable and intolerable,” he said in a statement.
Meanwhile, French government spokesman Gabriel Attal expressed support for the hospital director, saying Wednesday that what happened is “shameful. It’s revolting. It’s scandalous. And it’s inadmissible in the republic.”

Hong Kong announced a series of strict pandemic control measures Wednesday, including suspending flights from the United States and seven other countries, as it scrambled to contain an incipient coronavirus outbreak.
The new measures will deepen the city’s isolation from the outside world and mark a return to the tough restrictions the city imposed in the early days of the pandemic. Hong Kong has largely brought the coronavirus under control, but the arrival of the highly transmissible omicron variant threatens to fuel a new wave of cases.
“Given the very dire situation of the pandemic, we have to grasp this critical moment,” Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, said at a news conference.
Lam had said as recently as Tuesday that no new social distancing measures were expected. But the spread of omicron, including the infection of a person with no clear connections to the city’s first detected omicron cluster, evidently forced a change.
“We have to contain the pandemic to make sure there will not be a major outbreak in the community again,” she said. “We are racing with omicron.”
The restrictions will make it even harder to enter Hong Kong, which already imposes some of the world’s longest quarantines — up to three weeks — on arriving travelers. Under the new rules, no flights will be allowed from Australia, Britain, Canada, France, India, Pakistan, the Philippines or the United States for two weeks, starting Saturday. People who have recently been in those countries will also be barred from entering Hong Kong by other routes.
3:56 p.m.: Florida reported 59,487 COVID-19 cases and one new death Tuesday, according to Wednesday’s report to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based on Miami Herald calculations of CDC data.
In all, Florida has recorded at least 4,419,665 confirmed COVID cases and 62,542 deaths.
In the past seven days, as the omicron variant circulates, the state has added 22 deaths and 58,216 cases per day on average, according to Herald calculations of CDC data. That rolling seven-day case average is the highest it has ever been.
The CDC rates the community transmission for each Florida county as “high.”
To be considered at a high rate of transmission, new cases per 100,000 in the past seven days needs to be greater than or equal to 100, or the percentage of positive tests in the last seven days is greater than or equal to 10%.
All four South Florida counties are miles ahead of this minimum.
From Dec. 26 to Jan. 1, Miami-Dade County had a case rate of 3,678 new cases per 100,000 and a 35.3 per cent test positivity. Broward County’s case rate is at 2,496 with 38.4 per cent test positivity. Palm Beach County’s case rate is at 1,656 with 36 per cent test positivity. Monroe County’s case rate is at 1,287 with 32.8 per cent test positivity.
There were 7,647 people hospitalized for COVID-19 in Florida, according to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services’ Wednesday report. This data is reported from 236 Florida hospitals. The number of people hospitalized across the state is 733 more than the day prior, when 230 hospitals reported.
COVID-19 patients take up 14.06 per cent of all inpatient beds in the latest report, compared to 12.72 per cent among Tuesday’s reporting hospitals.
Omicron, so far, is not as deadly as delta’s surge last summer. Hospitalizations are approaching records set during delta’s wave from July through September.
At delta’s August peak, more than 15,000 people were hospitalized in Florida, with over 25 per cent of all inpatient beds being filled by COVID patients, according to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.
Of the people hospitalized in Florida, 866 were in intensive-care units, an increase of 88 from Tuesday. That represents about 13.81 per cent of the state’s ICU beds, compared to 12.50 per cent the previous day.
3:52 p.m.: Grocery stores are being urged to reinstate hazard pay for workers facing extra health and safety risks from the highly contagious Omicron variant.
The federal NDP’s critic for economic development has written to the heads of Canada’s biggest supermarkets asking them to restore “pandemic pay,” which was brought in after COVID-19 first struck and then cancelled.
Brian Masse, MP for Windsor West, says grocery store workers, including those at the checkout, are doing risky work during the Omicron surge and again deserve “hazard pay” for helping to keep stores open and shelves stocked.
The MP says he wants to hold Sobeys CEO Michael Medline to his promise before a Commons committee in July 2020 that he would reintroduce a wage premium if provinces reinstate restrictions.
Several grocery store chains including Sobeys did provide workers with a temporary wage bump during the third wave of COVID-19 last spring.
Provinces have reintroduced restrictions to tackle the Omicron variant, with Ontario returning schools to online learning and Quebec beginning Sunday closures of non-essential stores. British Columbia and Manitoba have also tightened controls.
Jacquelin Weatherbee, vice-president of communications at Sobeys, said the supermarket chain will reinstate its lockdown bonus if there are “government-mandated lockdowns that close all non-essential retail.”
3:51 p.m.: The upcoming Grammy Awards were postponed Wednesday due to what organizers called “too many risks” due to the omicron variant. No new date has been announced.
The ceremony had been scheduled for Jan. 31 in Los Angeles with a live audience and performances. The Recording Academy said it made the decision to postpone the ceremony “after careful consideration and analysis with city and state officials, health and safety experts, the artist community and our many partners.”
“Given the uncertainty surrounding the omicron variant, holding the show on Jan. 31 simply contains too many risks,” the academy said in a statement.
Last year, like most major awards shows in early 2021, the Grammys were postponed due to coronavirus concerns. The show was moved from late January to mid-March and held with a spare audience made up of mostly nominees and their guests in and around the Los Angeles Convention Center.
Many performances were pretaped, and none were in front of significant crowds.
The Grammys had been scheduled this year to return to its traditional home next door, the Crypto.com Arena, formerly the Staples Center.
3:44 p.m.: Health officials in New Brunswick reported 779 new cases of COVID-19 Wednesday and three more COVID-19-related deaths.
The deaths involved a person in their 50s in the Saint John region and two people in the Fredericton region — one in their 50s and the other in their 70s.
There were 59 people in hospital with the disease, including 16 in intensive care.
Ten people were on a ventilator.
Starting Saturday, the provincial government will stop releasing the number of daily cases confirmed by PCR testing in its news releases. The numbers will continue to be available on the government’s online dashboard.
Chief medical officer of health Dr. Jennifer Russell says the number of daily PCR-confirmed cases is not a true reflection of the severity of the situation in the province.
3:49 p.m.: President Emmanuel Macron of France drew fierce criticism Wednesday, mainly from his political opponents, after bluntly arguing that the government should make life miserable for the unvaccinated, as skyrocketing infection rates have put him under pressure ahead of a presidential election.
“I really want to piss off the unvaccinated,” Macron said in an interview with newspaper Le Parisien. “And so we are going to continue doing that, until the end.”
Macron appeared to be trying to capitalize on frustration in France with the unvaccinated. But some critics worried that his crude tone could unnecessarily antagonize anti-vaccine activists, while doing little to convince those who are reluctant to get vaccinated.
Macron said that those who had refused coronavirus vaccines were part of a small minority. About three-quarters of France’s 67 million people are fully vaccinated, but roughly 5 million French people have not received a single shot.
“I’m not going to put them in prison,” he said. “I’m not going to vaccinate them by force.”
Instead, the government is pushing a bill through Parliament that will tighten the eligibility of France’s health pass by no longer allowing people to obtain one with negative tests. The pass grants access to restaurants, cafes, museums and other public spaces.
Once the bill is approved, only proof of vaccination — or, in some cases, of recovery from COVID-19 — will be accepted, effectively barring the unvaccinated from large sections of French social life.
France has seen record-breaking numbers of new confirmed cases almost every day over the past week — over 270,000 for Tuesday alone — and hospitalizations are steadily increasing. But unlike some of its European neighbors, France has balked at imposing restrictions like curfews or lockdowns to keep infection rates in check.
3:40 p.m.: The challenge of ramping up Ontario’s third dose campaign has become even harder with vaccinators in public health settings needing time off because they have contracted COVID-19 or are experiencing burnout.
A “perfect storm” of factors has made sourcing booster appointments more difficult for Ontarians, while the capacity to provide doses sags under the weight of an Omicron-driven staffing shortage, two pharmacists told the Star.
According to the Star’s vaccine tracker , 4,056,554 people had received a third dose in Ontario as of Monday at 8 p.m.
Justin Bates, CEO of the Ontario Pharmacists Association (OPA), said a shortage of labour and burnout among pharmacists is impacting the number of people being vaccinated.

3:34 p.m.: A respected local organizer in Labrador’s northernmost town says her community has been thrown into crisis by an outbreak of COVID-19.
The health clinic in Nain, N.L., was understaffed before the pandemic started, with three nurses on staff when there should be six, Jenny Oliver said Wednesday in a phone interview from the community.
With one nurse isolating because of COVID-19, Oliver said there are two left scrambling to deal with a rise in demand for testing, a shortage of testing supplies, and a community of worried, confused and stressed residents — some of whom have tested positive for the disease.
“My fear is that the nurses that we currently have are going to burn out and leave, and we’ll be left with nobody,” said Oliver, a youth worker known for organizing community events.

3:10 p.m . The upcoming Grammy Awards were postponed Wednesday due to what organizers called “too many risks” due to the Omicron variant. No new date has been announced.
The ceremony had been scheduled for Jan. 31st in Los Angeles with a live audience and performances. The Recording Academy said it made the decision to postpone the ceremony “after careful consideration and analysis with city and state officials, health and safety experts, the artist community and our many partners.”
“Given the uncertainty surrounding the omicron variant, holding the show on January 31st simply contains too many risks,” the Recording Academy said in a statement.
2:54 p.m. The Winnipeg Police Service has declared a state of emergency in its efforts to deal with a staffing shortage caused by a spike in COVID-19 cases.
City police reported 90 active cases among staff, as of Wednesday, and said the service was trying to fill in the gaps as 170 employees were off on coronavirus-related leave.
General patrol has been hit hard by the increase in pandemic cases, the WPS said. Staff were being brought in from other areas to make sure enough officers were available to respond to daily calls for service.

2:50 p.m. The Manitoba government is changing its COVID-19 testing process amid rising case numbers and a backlog of tests.
Health officials say most people going to provincial testing sites will now be given rapid antigen tests to take home instead of a lab test on site.
Dr. Jazz Atwal, the deputy chief public health officer, says the change will help cut a backlog of some 6,800 PCR tests awaiting completion.
Atwal says the Omicron variant is spreading widely, and for every case detected there are probably eight to 10 cases that are undetected.
2:48 p.m. Ontario businesses were hit with another round of pandemic-related closures and capacity restrictions Wednesday, but details of financial support remained scant as the measures took effect.
Restaurants, gyms, cinemas and other indoor venues were forced to close while retail stores and personal care services were limited to half capacity in a government bid to rein in the rapidly spreading Omicron virus variant that’s caused infections and hospitalizations to skyrocket.
It’s a familiar routine now almost two years into the pandemic, particularly in Ontario where restrictions have been reintroduced repeatedly during virus surges. But the lack of immediate support this time around is “rage-inducing” for struggling business owners, said the president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business.
2:45 p.m. A hospital network in the Niagara region is shutting down one of its urgent care centres to redeploy doctors and nurses to emergency departments amid worsening staff shortages and rising COVID-19 admissions.
Niagara Health, which runs multiple sties, said its Fort Erie, Ont., urgent care centre will temporarily close on Thursday.
“This wave of the pandemic is beyond anything we have experienced,” Lynn Guerriero, president and CEO of Niagara Health, said in a written statement. “We have exhausted all options.”
Niagara Health said 354 of its staff members are currently in self-isolation, and 146 have tested positive for COVID-19 since Dec. 21.

2:36 p.m. Hospitals across the U.S. are feeling the wrath of the Omicron variant and getting thrown into disarray that is different from earlier COVID-19 surges.
This time, they are dealing with serious staff shortages because so many health care workers are getting sick with the fast-spreading variant. People are showing up at emergency rooms in large numbers in hopes of getting tested for COVID-19, putting more strain on the system. And a surprising share of patients — two-thirds in some places — are testing positive while in the hospital for other reasons.
At the same time, hospitals say the patients aren’t as sick as those who came in during the last surge. Intensive care units aren’t as full, and ventilators aren’t needed as much as they were before.
The pressures are neverthless prompting hospitals to scale back non-emergency surgeries and close wards, while National Guard troops have been sent in in several states to help at medical centers and testing sites.
2:22 p.m. A day after Switzerland’s team leader asked for talks about possibly postponing the Beijing Olympics because of the coronavirus pandemic, the IOC promised officials worldwide on Wednesday the Winter Games will go ahead as planned.
The Swiss Olympic committee said the IOC gave assurances about staging next month’s event during a video conference call with teams.
The International Olympic Committee also promised case-by-case assessments of athletes who recover after testing positive for COVID-19 ahead of traveling to China, the Swiss team said in a statement.
“The issue of a postponement is no longer relevant to all of us,” Swiss team leader Ralph Stöckli said in the statement.
2:20 p.m. The city of Toronto has fired 461 employees for not getting at least two doses of COVID-19 vaccine, and the fate of almost 300 other city workers hangs in the balance.
The news comes as the city plans for the possibility of mass city worker absences due to an explosion in local Omicron variant infections, with the possibility of service reductions due to a shortage of healthy, non-isolating staff.
The city said Wednesday that the 461 workers had not, by the deadline of last Sunday , shown proof of being vaccinated under a strict mandatory requirement announced last August in a bid to help boost Toronto vaccination rates.

2:17 p.m. Saskatchewan is looking to other provinces to see what measures they are using to try to keep front-line and essential staff working as COVID-19 cases driven by the Omicron variant surge.
Chief medical health officer, Dr. Saqib Shahab, says his recommendations on any further public health orders will be based on keeping essential services going as the province prepares for its biggest spike in infections yet.
The province has already shortened the self-isolation period for asymptomatic and vaccinated people to five days from 10 to allow workers to return to their jobs sooner.
Shahab says Saskatchewan’s mask mandate and proof of vaccination or a negative test — along with rapid tests — are enough to reduce numbers for the time being.
2:12 p.m. In-person learning at Quebec schools will resume on Jan. 17 as planned, Education Minister Jean-François Roberge said Wednesday, despite the continuing spread of COVID-19 in the province.
Roberge told reporters in Montreal that the province will distribute five COVID-19 self-tests per month to all primary and secondary school students in January and February as part of its plan to control spread of the disease in schools.
“Our schools are and will be safe,” he said
2:10 p.m. Air Canada announced that it will be suspending some flights to Sun destinations from Jan. 24 until April 30 due to “the current pandemic context.”
“Any travellers affected by the temporary suspension of the above listed destinations will be issued a full refund,” according to a statement.
Suspended destinations include Antigua, Aruba, Samaná, Curaçao, Exuma, Grenada, Puerto Plata, Santo Domingo, Bermuda, Grand Cayman, Havana, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Martin/Sint Maarten, and Saint Kitts and Nevis.”
2:05 p.m. GO Transit says staffing shortages caused by the Omicron variant of COVID-19 have prompted cancellations over the holidays, with additional service reductions planned in the coming days.
The regional transit agency serving the Greater Toronto and Hamilton region says a temporary reduction in train and bus service is set to begin within days, and new schedules will be made available at that time.
It says cancellations will be spread across its seven train corridors and bus routes, but notes cancelled trains will not be replaced by buses.

2 p.m. Health officials in Prince Edward Island are reporting 222 new cases of COVID-19 Wednesday.
There are 1,378 active reported cases of COVID-19 on the Island. Three people are hospitalized with the disease, including one in intensive care.
There are four other people in hospital for non-COVID-19 reasons who have tested positive for the disease. Chief medical officer of health Dr. Heather Morrison said today in a news release it’s more important than ever to follow public health measures, such as mask-wearing, physical distancing and proper handwashing.
Anyone with symptoms of COVID-19 is urged to get tested and self-isolate as they await results.
1:45 p.m. Premier Doug Ford is facing pressure to prevent a looming hospital crisis as Omicron drives up patient numbers and more and more health staff are isolating at home with symptoms.
Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca urged Ford to request help from the Canadian Armed Forces for hospitals and nursing homes where COVID-19 outbreaks are rising sharply, act faster to accredit foreign-trained nurses and free up doctors and nurses from vaccination centres by replacing them with dentists and other injection-qualified health-care professionals.
“There are urgent steps that need to be taken to make sure that a tough situation does not become that much worse … I don’t want Doug Ford to wait another week or two or five,” Del Duca told a news conference Wednesday.

1:30 p.m. The Omicron variant is now infecting Ontario seniors at record rates, prompting experts to warn of the risk of explosive growth in hospitalizations among these vulnerable adults.
Cases among those 60 or older have skyrocketed since the New Year. Ontario reported another 1,596 confirmed casesin the age group on Wednesday, including another 354 in seniors over 80. Despite the fact the province says its reported case counts are now unable to keep up with the variant’s spread, these totals are now significantly larger than the worst single-day highs of previous waves.
More than 92 per cent of Ontarians 60 plus have received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, but, as of Wednesday, about 58 per cent had received a booster, according to the province, meaning many seniors still lack additional protection from a virus now many times more transmissible than the previous Delta variant.

1:20 p.m. It’s the first day of school for Ontario students, but for many parents, logging back into online learning amid the province’s sudden decision to shut down schools has ended up in chaos.
“I’m currently in a meeting for genetic counselling for cancer screening. I have my daughter doing yoga off the TV just to keep her busy while my son is on (Microsoft Teams) doing work,” Akio Maroon said.
Maroon, an educator and artist living in Toronto has two kids — a 14-year-old son, Ocean, and a five-year-old daughter, Ella-Josephine, who has a physical disability. The mother of two is also a single parent and says she’s juggling multiple jobs at once.

1:10 p.m. Cases of COVID-19 continue to rise across Nunavut, with confirmed or presumptive cases in 14 of the territory’s 25 communities.
There are 231 active cases of COVID-19 in Nunavut, mostly in Iqaluit, Arviat and Rankin Inlet.
The territory has announced 21 new cases including a new presumptive case in the hamlet of Whale Cove.
There are 72 cases of COVID-19 in Iqaluit, 48 in Arviat and 45 in Rankin Inlet.
This is the territory’s most widespread outbreak to date, with COVID-19 cases rising in many of its small communities.
1 p.m. As Omicron continues to spread across the province, Ontario’s top doctor is recommending pregnant people be prioritized for third doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.
Dr. Kieran Moore, the province’s chief medical officer of health, sent a memo Tuesday to the heads of local health units, and hospital CEOs, asking clinics in primary and acute care to “prioritize appointments for pregnant women to facilitate the timely receipt of their booster vaccine due to the current epidemiology in the province.
Also addressed to groups like the Ontario Medical Association and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, it states that doctors caring for pregnant patients should “strongly encourage” them to get vaccinated, including third doses, “to prevent severe outcomes with Omicron .”

12:42 p.m. Several Quebec health authorities are being forced to cancel employee vacations as the province struggles with staff shortages and rising COVID-19 hospitalizations, and some workers fear this might be the final straw.
After working overtime without much time off since the beginning of the pandemic, nurse Agathe Vézina said the latest measure feels like a slap to health-care employees.
Vézina, who works as a mental health nurse in Rouyn-Noranda, about 500 kilometres northwest of Montreal, is currently on vacation and doesn’t know yet whether she will be affected by the restrictions. But she is worried because she booked her time off based on the availability of child care for her 17-month-old son.
“What am I supposed to do with my son, if I’m asked to go back to work tomorrow instead of next Sunday,” she asked. She said she worked hard to earn her time off, “and they want to cut them to us. Enough is enough.”
Quebec’s Health Department said on Tuesday many health-care facilities had recently disclosed plans to curtail vacations following a surge in hospitalizations and cases of COVID-19. Under a ministerial decree issued in the early months of the pandemic, employers in the health sector can suspend, cancel or refuse vacations in emergency situations.
12:15 p.m. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says the federal government is ramping up delivery of rapid tests to the provinces as tests run scarce across the country and access to molecular tests is restricted.
Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos says 140 million tests will be distributed in January on a per-capita basis.
Trudeau says that’s triple the number provinces received in December.
In its last fiscal update, the government earmarked $1.7 billion to secure a supply of about 180 million rapid tests.
The prime minister also confirmed there are enough vaccine doses in Canada for everyone in the country to get their booster.
Duclos says there will be enough child-sized doses for all kids aged five to 11 this month.
11:47 a.m. Quebec is reporting 39 more deaths attributed to the coronavirus Wednesday and a rise of 158 COVID-19-related hospitalizations.
The Health Department says data from the last 24 hours indicates 1,750 people were in hospital with COVID-19, after 321 patients were admitted and 163 were discharged. It says 191 people were in intensive care, a rise of six from the day before.
Officials are reporting 14,486 new COVID-19 cases today and say about 28 per cent of tests came back positive — the same test-positivity rate as the prior day. The government is no longer offering PCR testing to the general public and is instead prioritizing those tests for higher-risk groups.
The Health Department is reporting 316 new COVID-19 cases in long-term care centres, bringing the total number of cases in those facilities to 1,537. There have been 39 deaths linked to active COVID-19 outbreaks in long-term care.
10:45 a.m. Dozens of anti-vaccination protesters in the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe attacked a hospital director and other medical staff following recent violent demonstrations against vaccines and COVID-19 restrictions, officials said Wednesday.
The attack occurred Tuesday outside the University Hospital Center as police tried to escort the director and other staff elsewhere for safety. The hospital said the director briefly lost consciousness and that the crowd ripped the clothes of the deputy general director and threw urine at both. The car of an executive assistant also was seriously damaged, officials said.
A health workers’ union that organized Tuesday’s demonstration and previous ones that turned violent to protest vaccine requirements and other measures told local media that members are seeking to recover lost wages after being suspended for refusing to become vaccinated as required by law.
10:33 a.m. Bayern Munich says Canadian star Alphonso Davies has joined the list of players to test positive for COVID-19.
The Bundesliga club says the 21-year-old fullback from Edmonton is well and self-isolating at home.
Other players to have tested positive include Leroy Sane, Dayot Upamecano, Lucas Hernandez, Tanguy Nianzou, Manuel Neuer, Kingsley Coman, Corentin Tolisso and Omar Richards. Assistant coach Dino Toppmoeller is also self-isolating after a positive test.
Bayern returned to training Monday,17 days after its last competitive match of 2021 — a 4-0 win Wolfsburg.
Training was to have resumed Sunday but was pushed back a day due to the pandemic, with all players, coaches and staff undergoing PCR tests Monday.
10:20 a.m. Ontario is reporting 2,081 people hospitalized with COVID-19 and 288 in the ICU; at least 11,582 new cases. Positivity is 28.1 per cent.
The seven-day rolling average of COVID-19 related patients in ICU is 235.
More than 180,000 vaccine doses were administered yesterday; 90.9 per cent of Ontarians 12+ have one dose and 88.2 per cent have two doses, according to tweets from Health Minister Christine Elliott.
10:15 a.m. Cyprus further tightened its pandemic restrictions on Wednesday, reducing the number of people permitted at social gatherings and mandating virus testing for schoolteachers and all inbound travelers over 12 amid surging COVID-19 infections.
Cypriot Health Minister Michalis Hadjipantela said after a Cabinet meeting that teachers, students and staff will need to produce a negative rapid test taken within two days prior to their return from Christmas and New Year holidays on Jan. 10.
Moreover, all primary school pupils will need to produce a negative rapid test twice weekly.
10 a.m. With his medical exemption approved, Novak Djokovic may have some explaining to do when he gets to Melbourne to defend his Australian Open title .
The exemption allows the top-ranked Djokovic entry to the tournament regardless of his vaccination status for COVID-19, a subject he has declined to clarify amid months of speculation he could miss the season-opening major unless he can prove he’s had two doses of a coronavirus vaccine.
That’s a Victoria state government-mandated condition of entry for all players, staff, fans and officials entering Melbourne Park when the tournament starts on Jan. 17.
9:45 a.m. Vaccinated people arriving into Ireland will no longer need a negative COVID-19 test, following a government decision Wednesday.
Arrivals with a valid digital COVID certificate or another proof of recent infection or vaccination will not require a test to enter the country.
The decision reverses measures introduced a month ago to stem the spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. The rule is no longer necessary as the variant is now dominant in Ireland, Prime Minister Micheal Martin told reporters in Dublin.
9:30 a.m. Liverpool closed its training centre on Wednesday in the wake of the latest coronavirus outbreak to rip through a Premier League squad.
Pepijn Lijnders, the coach who has been filling in for Jurgen Klopp while the Liverpool manager is in isolation, is one of “multiple players and staff” who tested positive for COVID-19 in the latest round of checks, the club said.
It has prompted Liverpool to request that Thursday’s first-leg match against Arsenal in the English League Cup semifinals be postponed, with injuries and absences because of the African Cup of Nations also reducing player availability. The English Football League is assessing the matter.
After consulting with public-health authorities, the club temporarily shut its first-team training facilities. Practice was canceled on Tuesday.
9:15 a.m. The Centers for Disease Control Prevention is urging Americans to “avoid travel to Aruba” due to a “very high level of COVID-19.”
Its new “Level 4” ranking signifies more than 500 new COVID cases per 100,000 people in the population over the past 28 days.
“Because of the current situation in Aruba, even fully vaccinated travelers may be at risk for getting and spreading COVID-19 variants,” the CDC said in a Travel Health Notice posted Tuesday.
In late November, the CDC and State Department had urged Americans to “reconsider travel to Aruba” due to COVID conditions in the Caribbean island nation.
9 a.m. Hawaii revamped its entry requirements this week, dropping a questionnaire requirement and cutting the mandatory quarantine period in half.
Starting Tuesday, travelers to the Pacific island state will no longer need to fill out a health form before arrival.
Previously, tourists had to fill out a health questionnaire 24 hours before their flight to receive a QR code that could reduce processing time upon arrival. Under the new entry requirements, visitors will receive a QR code via email once their trip information is submitted through the Safe Travels platform and will have it sent to their inbox once again one day prior to departure.
8:50 a.m. Hong Kong authorities announced a two-week ban on flights from the United States and seven other countries and held 2,500 passengers on a cruise ship for coronavirus testing Wednesday as the city attempted to stem an emerging omicron outbreak.
The two-week ban on passenger flights from Australia, Canada, France, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Britain and the United States will take effect Sunday and continue until Jan. 21.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam also announced that restaurant dining will be forbidden after 6 p.m. for two weeks starting Friday. Game arcades, bars and beauty salons must also close during that period.
8:35 a.m. Senegal’s national soccer team was forced to delay its flight to the African Cup of Nations in Cameroon after three more players and six members of the backroom staff tested positive for the coronavirus.
The Senegalese soccer federation named the players on Wednesday as Pape Sarr, Nampalys Mendy and Mame Thiam. They and six members of the management team tested positive on Tuesday, when the squad was scheduled to fly to Cameroon, the federation said.
The federation said the team should now leave on Wednesday. It didn’t say if the three players and officials would also travel or remain in Dakar in isolation, only that it had “made arrangements for the effective care of the people concerned.”
8:20 a.m. Poland’s President Andrzej Duda has tested positive for COVID-19 but has no serious symptoms, an aide said Wednesday.
The aide, Pawel Szrot, said on Twitter that Duda was under medical observation but feels well.
Duda, 49, has been vaccinated against the coronavirus and received a booster shot last month, Szrot said. The president got tested this week because of cases among employees in his office.
7:45 a.m. The leader of Britain’s opposition Labour Party tested positive for the coronavirus and will miss the chance to grill Prime Minister Boris Johnson about the government’s COVID-19 policies Wednesday as soaring infections strain the U.K. health system.
Johnson said Tuesday that the country has “a chance to ride out” the omicron variant-driven surge in infections without imposing tough lockdown measures. He is scheduled to answer questions in Parliament on Wednesday afternoon and to deliver a statement on COVID-19.
A party spokesperson said Labour leader Keir Starmer would miss the session after testing positive for the virus.
Confirmed new daily infections across the U.K. jumped to a record 218,274 on Tuesday, 15% more than the previous high set Dec. 31. However, inconsistent reporting during the holiday period may have inflated the daily figures.
6:50 a.m. As Omicron cases continue to hit new highs, businesses across Ontario are dealing with yet another blow: worker absences are on the rise as employees call in sick or take time off to look after their kids, forcing businesses to shorten hours and scale back production of certain goods.
Giancarlo Trimarchi, president of independent grocery chain Vince’s Market, said absences picked up quickly right before Christmas, due to either positive cases or close contacts. Between Christmas and New Year’s Eve, around 18 per cent of his staff were unable to work, he said, a number that has since dipped slightly.
To mitigate the labour shortage, Trimarchi said the stores have closed certain departments, such as the deli counter, early and relied heavily on seasonal staff. The grocery chain came close to closing a department for an entire day at a couple of locations last week, he said, but the company is committed to doing whatever is necessary to stay open.

6:05 a.m.: Leaders of Chicago Public Schools cancelled classes Wednesday after the teachers union voted to switch to remote learning due to the surge in COVID-19 cases, the latest development in an escalating battle over pandemic safety protocols in the nation’s third-largest school district.
Chicago has rejected a districtwide return to remote instruction, saying it was disastrous for children’s learning and mental health. But the union argued the district’s safety protocols are lacking and both teachers and students are vulnerable.
The Chicago Teachers Union’s action, approved by 73% of members, called for remote instruction until “cases substantially subside” or union leaders approve an agreement for safety protocols with the district. Union members were instructed to try and log into teaching systems Wednesday, even though the district said there would be no instruction and didn’t distribute devices to students ahead of the union votes, which were announced just before 11 p.m. Tuesday.
“This decision was made with a heavy heart and a singular focus on student and community safety,” the union said in a statement.
6 a.m.: Australia on Wednesday saw another jump in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations and long queues at testing centres as it continued to battle the rapid spread of the virus in most states.
The country recorded more than 64,000 cases, up from 47,000 a day earlier, and Prime Minister Scott Morrison met virtually with the national cabinet — the leaders of Australia’s states and territories — to discuss how to respond to almost daily records in new cases and rising pressure on hospitals.
Morrison has faced increasing calls to make rapid antigen tests available free to relieve pressure on PCR testing centres, many of which have been forced to close after reaching capacity. People who have been tested often face long waits for results from overburdened laboratories.
Speaking to reporters after the national cabinet meeting, Morrison said state premiers and first ministers opposed universal free tests. But more than 6 million Australians including seniors and others on welfare or with low incomes will be eligible for up to 10 free tests every three months. Free tests also are available to those who have symptoms or are deemed close contacts.
Among other measures to alleviate pressure on PCR testing centres, Morrison said those who return a positive rapid antigen test no longer need to have a PCR test to confirm the result.
6 a.m.: Hong Kong authorities announced a two-week ban on flights from the United States and seven other countries and held 2,500 passengers on a cruise ship for coronavirus testing Wednesday as the city attempted to stem an emerging Omicron outbreak.
The two-week ban on passenger flights from Australia, Canada, France, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Britain and the United States will take effect Sunday and continue until Jan. 21.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam also announced that restaurant dining will be forbidden after 6 p.m. for two weeks starting Friday. Game arcades, bars and beauty salons must also close during that period.
“We have to contain the pandemic to ensure that there will not be a major outbreak in the community again,” Lam said at a news conference, adding that the city is “on the verge” of another surge.
6 a.m.: French President Emmanuel Macron has provoked outcries in Parliament and protests from election rivals by using a vulgarity to describe his strategy for pressuring vaccine refusers to get coronavirus jabs.
Macron used the French word “emmerder,” rooted in the French word for “crap” and meaning to rile or to bug, in an interview published by French newspaper Le Parisien on Tuesday night. The president made the explosive remark as lawmakers are heatedly debating new measures that would allow only the vaccinated to enjoy leisure activities such as eating out.
“The unvaccinated, I really want to bug them. And so we will continue doing so, to the end. That’s the strategy,” Le Parisien quoted the French leader as saying in a sit-down interview at the presidential Elysée Palace with a panel of its readers.
His use of earthy language more commonly heard at the counters of French cafés further complicated the already difficult passage in Parliament of the government’s planned new vaccine pass. Lawmakers debated into early Wednesday morning before their discussions were again suspended, disrupted by the furor over Macron’s remarks.
6 a.m.: China on Wednesday reported a major drop in COVID-19 infections in the northern city of Xi’an, which has been under a tight lockdown for the past two weeks that has sharply disrupted the lives of its 13 million residents.
The National Health Commission announced just 35 new cases in Xi’an, home to the famed Terracotta Warriors statues along with major industries, down from 95 the day before.
Health officials said they have basically achieved the goal of halting community transmission because the new cases were among people already quarantined.
The decline has continued since daily new cases topped 100, which had prompted officials to retain and in some cases tighten restrictions on people leaving their homes.
Xi’an has reported more than 1,600 cases but no deaths in its latest surge. That’s a small number compared to outbreaks in other countries, a sign that China’s “zero tolerance” strategy of quarantining every case, mass testing and trying to block new infections from abroad has helped it contain major outbreaks.
5:54 a.m.: Israel opened to tourists for the first time in nearly two years. After just a month, it slammed shut. Now the Omicron variant has set a widely-expected record for new infections in the country, which will once again crack open on Sunday — but only to travellers from certain nations.
The back-and-forth has created whiplash for many Israelis. Even in the relatively small, wealthy Mideast nation — an early global leader against the coronavirus pandemic — the Omicron variant is outpacing the government’s ability to make and execute clear pandemic public policy. What once was a straightforward regimen of vaccines, testing, contact tracing and distancing for the nation of 9.4 million has splintered into a zigzag of rules that seem to change every few days.
The confusion here, on everything from tourism to testing, quarantines, masks and school policy, offers a glimpse of the pandemic puzzle facing governments worldwide as the Omicron variant burns through the population. Someday, the World Health Organization will declare the pandemic over. But in the meantime, leaders are weighing how much illness, isolation and death people are willing to risk.
5:50 a.m.: Stricter COVID-19 measures are taking effect in Ontario Wednesday.
School classes will run remotely until at least Jan. 17, while most other measures, including business closures, are slated to last at least 21 days.
Hospitals are ordered to pause all non-urgent surgeries to free up staff to cover absences and the rising number of hospitalized virus patients.
Several kinds of business including cinemas, gyms, theatres and restaurants must close for indoor activities.
Some other businesses including retail stores and personal care services are limited to 50 per cent capacity.
Social gatherings are limited to five people indoors and 10 people outdoors.
5:45 a.m.: Chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam will join Prime Minister Justin Trudeau this morning for the first federal COVID-19 update of the new year.
The update follows Trudeau’s phone call yesterday with B.C. Premier and Council of the Federation chair John Horgan, where the prime minister said he would hold a call with the premiers next week to discuss how governments are keeping citizens safe.
The surge in cases brought on by the Omicron variant of COVID-19 has forced multiple provinces to postpone non-urgent surgeries, reduce access to COVID tests and delay the return to in-person learning for students.
Trudeau’s office says he and Horgan also discussed the Canada Health Transfer, and agreed to continue discussions with all provincial and territorial governments to ensure Canadians are supported by effective health-care systems.

Full text: The lone unvaccinated Progressive Conservative MPP is calling it quits.
Less than five months after Premier Doug Ford decreed that all Tory MPPs and candidates in the June 2 election must have their COVID-19 shots, Christina Mitas (Scarborough-Centre) has announced she will not seek re-election.
While Mitas had a "medical exemption" from vaccination for undisclosed reasons, insiders say her presence in the Tory caucus was a source of consternation to some of Ford's advisers.
She disclosed her retirement Tuesday.
That was the same day new provincial rules took effect, requiring anyone with a vaccination exemption to have it verified by a local public health unit.
That information will then be included on the Verify Ontario QR code that is used to access indoor services that require proof of vaccination.
"I started off life as an elected official pregnant with my first child and will end this term with three babies three and under," Mitas, who was first elected in 2018, said in a written statement.
"After careful and honest discussions as a family, I have decided that life as an elected official is not in the best interest of my family at this time.
"Thus, I am announcing that I will not be seeking re-election this June," she said.
"I remain a true blue conservative - I believe in small government, family, God and freedom with all my heart."
Mitas's departure comes a little more than two months after fellow first-term MPP Lindsey Park (Durham) quit the Tory caucus amid claims from government house leader Paul Calandra that she "misrepresented her vaccination status" to her colleagues.
Park, who has denied that and accused the Tories of issuing a "false statement" about her decision not to get her COVID-19 shots, also had a doctor's note excusing her from getting vaccinated. She is not running again.
Last August, Ford fired veteran MPP Rick Nicholls (Chatham-Kent-Leamington) from the PC caucus for refusing to get vaccinated.

In about-face, Ford closes Ontario schools and bans indoor dining due to Omicron 'tsunami'

Full text: In an about-face triggered by the Omicron “tsunami,” Premier Doug Ford has ordered schools to do virtual learning for at least the next two weeks.
Ford also imposed other COVID-19 restrictions starting Wednesday, including a temporary 21-day ban on indoor restaurant dining and the postponement of scheduled surgeries.
“Omicron case counts are rising exponentially across the province. We face a tsunami of new cases in the days and weeks ahead,” a grim-faced premier told reporters Monday at Queen’s Park.
“It can’t be stopped — look to other countries, other provinces, it’s too contagious to stop completely,” he said, stressing the measures are designed to allow Ontario’s booster shot program to take hold.
The moves come just four days after Dr. Kieran Moore, the chief medical officer of health, assured Ontarians schools would reopen for in-class learning this Wednesday.
Instead, students will be in virtual learning until at least Jan. 17.
Moore warned Monday that hospitalization rates “will ascend fairly rapidly over the coming weeks” before Omicron subsides, as has been seen in other jurisdictions.
“We anticipate that it’ll reach its maximum by the end of January and then start to descend. So we anticipate a very short, quick and rapid approach to this epidemic and impact on the health-care system,” he said.
“That is why these measures are timely, they’re proportionate to the risk.”
Cathy Abraham, president of the Ontario Public School Boards’ Association, said the switch to online learning “is not what we’d hoped for — we had hoped that we would get to Jan. 5 and that we would be able to keep schools open for kids. Clearly, it is not safe to do so, and it’s not prudent to do so right now.”
However, she added, “we’ve got two weeks to do something. We are hoping the government will take those two weeks and not spare a penny” — as Ford promised Monday. Abraham also called for N95 respirators in schools for all staff and teachers to be included in the now-limited PCR testing, and for the COVID vaccine added to the list of mandatory shots for students.
“We want kids to go back to school, but safer — we need to make sure things are safer so we don’t keep doing this on and off again, on and off again” with kids ping-ponging between online and in-person classes, added Dr. Anna Banerji, a pediatrician and University of Toronto professor.
Beginning Wednesday — and continuing until Jan. 26 — Ontario will be plunged into a modified Step 2 of the “roadmap to reopen.”
That means a prohibition on indoor gyms, dining inside at restaurants and bars, and reducing social gathering limits to five people indoors and 10 people outdoors.
Outdoor dining, takeout, and delivery from restaurants will be permitted.
Shops, including malls, will be allowed to operate at half capacity as will most personal care services, such as barbershops and hair salons.
Museums, galleries, zoos, science centres, landmarks, historic sites and other attractions will be closed.
Child-care centres located in schools will remain open and emergency daycare services for front-line workers will be available.
But “all non-emergent and non-urgent surgeries and procedures” will be postponed in hospitals to preserve capacity.
There are now 1,232 people hospitalized with COVID-19 in the province, though as many as half of them are believed to have been admitted for other ailments and happened to test positive while in hospital. Of the total, 248 are in Ontario intensive care units.
In all, the province has a capacity of about 2,300 ICU beds — on Monday some 700 fully staffed beds were sitting empty. Meanwhile, hospitals are scrambling to address staff absences due to illness.
But it is feared there could be 400 to 500 people classified as COVID-19 patients in ICUs by the end of this week.
Ford said the new restrictions “will be targeted and they will be time-limited.”
Dr. Peter Jüni, scientific director of the province’s COVID-19 science table, said the government restrictions announced Monday “are appropriate” and should help the government’s goal to “blunt the wave” of Omicron cases.
“The highest-risk categories, those higher risk than schools, are all closed — restaurants, bars, clubs, gyms” and also cinemas and theatres, Jüni said.
With capacity limits, retail is “much less of an issue” and unlike schools, people don’t gather there for prolonged periods in groups.
“It’s absolutely justified now,” he added. “Is it ideal? No, absolutely not — nothing is ideal with Omicron. Could one have decided differently? Yes, but there is no clear right or wrong decision. I feel there is really a true commitment to open schools up again as soon as possible, and the sequence I see from an epidemiological perspective was the right sequence.”
There were 13,578 additional COVID-19 cases reported Monday, though the actual number is likely far higher due to new limits on the availability of PCR tests.
Sources, speaking confidentially in order to discuss internal deliberations, say there is mounting frustration at the highest levels of the government with Moore, the science table and other public health officials.
That’s because last June — before the Omicron variant had been detected — Ford requested a fall pandemic plan that included a booster shot rollout, expanded rapid antigen testing, anti-viral medications and antibody testing, sources said.
But insiders say there was resistance from some in the medical community, who did not want Ontario hoarding vaccines that could be shared with developing nations and who doubted the efficacy of rapid tests and widespread testing for antibodies.
Jüni said there was no such resistance, and that there is no tension between the science table and the government.
“This is very challenging for elected decision-makers, and I’m glad they made the right decision,” he said.
Last Thursday, Moore announced that he “absolutely” endorsed opening schools on Jan. 5 after the holiday break, two days later than most boards in the province had scheduled, a move supported by experts at the Hospital for Sick Children and CHEO children’s hospital in Ottawa, as well as the science table.
Ontario students have been out of class and learning online more than any others in the country, at 26 weeks since the pandemic began.
Most other provinces have delayed the start of school by a week, to Jan. 10.
“The No. 1 priority is to make sure that the kids have an opportunity to learn online, that’s absolutely critical,” Ford said of the delay in reopening schools to in-person learning.
“But we have to protect the overall system. When I talk about the system, I’m talking, again, the hospitalizations, the schools, the economy, the businesses, that’s who we have to protect.”
Ontario data — echoing findings in the U.S., South Africa, the United Kingdom, and Denmark — has shown the risk of hospitalization or death from Omicron is 54 per cent lower than the more virulent Delta variant.
With an Ontario election set for June 2, there is massive political pressure on Ford’s Progressive Conservatives.
In a bid to underscore that his government is taking the pandemic seriously, the premier was joined at the podium — emblazoned with “Boost Up” — on Monday by Moore, Health Minister Christine Elliott and Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy.
But Ford’s critics have consistently accused him of being too slow to react since the pandemic began in March 2020.
“We can’t keep doing this. Two weeks to flatten the curve for the health-care system is quickly turning into two years for small businesses affected by lockdowns and other restrictions,” the Canadian Federation of Independent Business said in a statement.
NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said, “parents are horrified — another school shutdown is a massive blow to kids’ well-being.”
“Doug Ford knew exactly what was coming, but didn’t prepare schools or hospitals, and didn’t take any precautions to prevent a lockdown,” she said.

Full text: In an about-face triggered by the Omicron "tsunami," Premier Doug Ford has ordered schools to do virtual learning for at least the next two weeks.
Ford also imposed other COVID-19 restrictions starting Wednesday, including a temporary 21-day ban on indoor restaurant dining and the postponement of scheduled surgeries.
"Omicron case counts are rising exponentially across the province. We face a tsunami of new cases in the days and weeks ahead," a grim-faced premier told reporters Monday at Queen's Park.
"It can't be stopped - look to other countries, other provinces, it's too contagious to stop completely," he said, stressing the measures are designed to allow Ontario's booster shot program to take hold.
The moves come just four days after Dr. Kieran Moore, the chief medical officer of health, assured Ontarians schools would reopen for in-class learning this Wednesday. Instead, students will be in virtual learning until at least Jan. 17.
Moore warned Monday that hospitalization rates "will ascend fairly rapidly over the coming weeks" before Omicron subsides, as has been seen in other jurisdictions.
"We anticipate that it'll reach its maximum by the end of January and then start to descend. So we anticipate a very short, quick and rapid approach to this epidemic and impact on the health-care system," he said. "That is why these measures are timely, they're proportionate to the risk."
Cathy Abraham, president of the Ontario Public School Boards' Association, said the switch to online learning "is not what we'd hoped for - we had hoped that we would get to Jan. 5 and that we would be able to keep schools open for kids. Clearly, it is not safe to do so, and it's not prudent to do so right now."
However, she added, "we've got two weeks to do something. We are hoping the government will take those two weeks and not spare a penny" - as Ford promised Monday. Abraham also called for N95 respirators in schools for all staff and teachers to be included in the now-limited PCR testing, and for the COVID vaccine to be added to the list of mandatory shots for students.
"We want kids to go back to school, but safer - we need to make sure things are safer so we don't keep doing this on and off again, on and off again" with kids ping-ponging between online and in-person classes, added Dr. Anna Banerji, a pediatrician and University of Toronto professor.
Beginning Wednesday - and continuing until Jan. 26 - Ontario will be plunged into a modified Step 2 of the "roadmap to reopen."
That means a prohibition on indoor gyms, dining inside at restaurants and bars, and reducing social gathering limits to five people indoors and 10 people outdoors.
Outdoor dining, takeout, and delivery from restaurants will be permitted.
Shops, including malls, will be allowed to operate at half capacity as will most personal care services, such as barbershops and hair salons.
Museums, galleries, zoos, science centres, landmarks, historic sites and other attractions will be closed.
Child-care centres located in schools will remain open and emergency daycare services for front-line workers will be available.
But "all non-emergent and non-urgent surgeries and procedures" will be postponed in hospitals to preserve capacity.
There are now 1,232 people hospitalized with COVID-19 in the province, though as many as half of them are believed to have been admitted for other ailments and happened to test positive while in hospital. Of the total, 248 are in Ontario intensive care units.
In all, the province has a capacity of about 2,300 ICU beds - on Monday some 700 fully staffed beds were sitting empty. Meanwhile, hospitals are scrambling to address staff absences due to illness.
But it is feared there could be 400 to 500 people classified as COVID-19 patients in ICUs by the end of this week.
Ford said the new restrictions "will be targeted and they will be time-limited."
Dr. Peter Jüni, scientific director of the province's COVID-19 science table, said the government restrictions announced Monday "are appropriate" and should help the government's goal to "blunt the wave" of Omicron cases.
"The highest-risk categories, those higher risk than schools, are all closed - restaurants, bars, clubs, gyms" and also cinemas and theatres, Jüni said.
With capacity limits, retail is "much less of an issue" and unlike schools, people don't gather there for prolonged periods in groups.
"It's absolutely justified now," he added. "Is it ideal? No, absolutely not - nothing is ideal with Omicron. Could one have decided differently? Yes, but there is no clear right or wrong decision. I feel there is really a true commitment to open schools up again as soon as possible, and the sequence I see from an epidemiological perspective was the right sequence."
There were 13,578 additional COVID-19 cases reported Monday, though the actual number is likely far higher due to new limits on the availability of PCR tests.
Sources, speaking confidentially in order to discuss internal deliberations, say there is mounting frustration at the highest levels of the government with Moore, the science table and other public health officials.
That's because last June - before the Omicron variant had been detected - Ford requested a fall pandemic plan that included a booster shot rollout, expanded rapid antigen testing, anti-viral medications and antibody testing, sources said.
But insiders say there was resistance from some in the medical community, who did not want Ontario hoarding vaccines that could be shared with developing nations and who doubted the efficacy of rapid tests and widespread testing for antibodies.
Jüni said there was no such resistance, and that there is no tension between the science table and the government.
"This is very challenging for elected decision-makers, and I'm glad they made the right decision," he said.
Last Thursday, Moore announced that he "absolutely" endorsed opening schools on Jan. 5 after the holiday break, two days later than most boards in the province had scheduled, a move supported by experts at the Hospital for Sick Children and CHEO children's hospital in Ottawa, as well as the science table.
Ontario students have been out of class and learning online more than any others in the country, at 26 weeks since the pandemic began.
Most other provinces have delayed the start of school by a week, to Jan. 10.
"The No. 1 priority is to make sure that the kids have an opportunity to learn online, that's absolutely critical," Ford said of the delay in reopening schools to in-person learning. "But we have to protect the overall system. When I talk about the system, I'm talking, again, the hospitalizations, the schools, the economy, the businesses, that's who we have to protect."
Ontario data - echoing findings in the U.S., South Africa, the United Kingdom, and Denmark - has shown the risk of hospitalization or death from Omicron is 54 per cent lower than the more virulent Delta variant.
With an Ontario election set for June 2, there is massive political pressure on Ford's Progressive Conservatives.
In a bid to underscore that his government is taking the pandemic seriously, the premier was joined at the podium - emblazoned with "Boost Up" - on Monday by Moore, Health Minister Christine Elliott and Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy.
But Ford's critics have consistently accused him of being too slow to react since the pandemic began in March 2020.
"We can't keep doing this. Two weeks to flatten the curve for the health-care system is quickly turning into two years for small businesses affected by lockdowns and other restrictions," the Canadian Federation of Independent Business said in a statement.
NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said, "parents are horrified - another school shutdown is a massive blow to kids' well-being."
"Doug Ford knew exactly what was coming, but didn't prepare schools or hospitals, and didn't take any precautions to prevent a lockdown," she said.

Full text: Province has its head in the sand
Premier Doug Ford, Education Minister Stephen Lecce and Dr. Kieran Moore need to stop lying.
Schools are not safe from transmission.
In the school where I teach, there are 1,600-plus people, and hundreds who are unvaccinated. Mask rules go ignored, ventilation upgrades have been minimal and safety measures like HEPA filters are inconsistently used. At lunch, hundreds of students eat together in the least-ventilated parts of the building, unmasked and with zero spacing.
Meanwhile, larger and better ventilated spaces like sports arenas permit only 1,000 vaccinated people. If the plan is to accelerate the rate of infection among school-aged children, educators and all their contacts, Dr. Moore and his political superiors should say so.
David Mandelzys, Toronto
Nothing wrong with Amazon
Billionaire Bezos really needed the free advertising, Letter, Jan. 1
As someone who came to Canada from the developing world, albeit a long time ago, I was floored reading this letter and similar ones lambasting the Star for publishing a front-page illustration showing some boxes with the Amazon logo. Perhaps it was inevitable, since it delivers all kinds of products including toys.
It's safe to say that the developing or any other world would give anything to have this company among them, just as Toronto tried to get a second Amazon HQ some years ago, since it is an example and promoter of the new economy. Sure, as many other large enterprises it has faults, but no one well informed can deny that it fuels economic activity in innovative ways benefiting everyone, including these letter writers.
Jaime Oksemberg, Toronto
Optometrists need compassion
Ford's treatment of optometrists is appalling, Letter, Jan. 1
In response to letter writer Dr. Peter Rozanec, I have to say he appears to have little empathy or consideration for those who have been affected the most by his organization's "work to rule."
He failed to mention seniors and other special needs patients who would normally be covered by OHIP.
Optometrists are not primary health-care providers; they're for-profit service providers whose primary concern is, like all other for-profit ventures, the bottom line.
As soon as the province announced that optometrists would once again see seniors, I contacted my optometrist to book an appointment. I was told in no uncertain terms that I would be put on a waiting list and they could not give me any idea when I was likely to actually be booked in. Their rationale was they could not rebook their "regular" customers to allow seniors to enter because "it wouldn't be fair."
In other words, they needed to keep the cash flow up at all costs.
Ivan Solomons, Ennismore, Ont.
Ford's leadership is embarrassing
I have lived in Ontario for 53 years and 2021 was the first time I was ashamed to live here.
There are three things specifically the Ford government is doing wrong:
First, forcing the optometrists to not allow patients covered under OHIP to have appointments. Secondly, the lack of PCR testing is irresponsible and will increase the cases we have even further. Last, now school cases won't even be counted.
If Ford wins the election in June, I will think about moving to Prince Edward Island.

Full text: "We're fighting the carbon tax because it hurts seniors, workers, families and small businesses," Premier Doug Ford tweeted in 2019. Which makes it all the more interesting that the Ford government is introducing a new Ontario carbon tax to start the year.
Ford's carbon tax takes the form of a program called the Emission Performance Standards (EPS) program. Today it replaces a similar program operated by the federal government called the Output-Based Pricing System (OBPS). A big difference between the two programs, though, is that the federal one returns all revenues to the province, whereas Ford's program is primed to pocket the cash as government revenue.
(Ontario's Environment Ministry previously mused about directing revenues to a "greenhouse gas emission fund" that would help support industry in reducing emissions. So far, there isn't one.)
If Ford hates carbon taxes so much because of the extra costs passed to consumers, he could have made Ontario's carbon pricing program entirely revenue neutral. Its cash could be returned to Ontarians in the form of tax breaks or other benefits.
That's what British Columbia's Liberal government did for years before the NDP came to power (they tweaked the program to be revenue-positive). But when the Ford Progressive Conservatives were offered the chance to live up to their own true blue conservative rhetoric, they proved that despite relentlessly hammering the Wynne Liberals for it leading into 2018's election, they wouldn't mind collecting that carbon tax revenue after all.
Here's how it all works. The federal Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act operates by means of two components: a fuel charge levied directly on fossil fuels (the "fuel charge"), and an industrial cap-and-trade program for large industrial facilities (the OBPS).
The OBPS is more forgiving than the fuel charge. It's meant to ease the regulatory burden placed on heavy industry and keep it internationally competitive by putting a cap on facilities' annual emissions. If they go over that, they can buy allowances from facilities emitting under their cap (which can profit by the sale) or pay the government per excess tonne of carbon at the applicable rate.
Because the federal carbon pricing program does not contribute to federal revenue, it technically is not - and never has been - a tax. It is a "regulatory charge," as court after court reiterated in the various multimillion-dollar lawsuits Ford launched or invited during his futile anti-carbon pricing crusade.
In 2019, presumably anticipating the ultimate failure of their constitutional challenge to the federal law, the Ford government created the EPS by regulatory rule making. In 2020, the federal government accepted the EPS as compliant with federal carbon pricing standards. And so the EPS replaces the OBPS with a comparable (albeit more lenient) provincial program, and its revenues will go to the province.
At this point, technically speaking, Ford has now created more carbon taxes than Justin Trudeau.
Because the federal law allows provinces to price carbon however they want - as long as a program meets or exceeds federal standards - and provinces can make whatever use they want of the proceeds, Ford's government could have come up with its own fuel charge, in addition to its industrial program, and ensured that the increased cost burden on citizens was simply returned or offset.
Tax breaks or credits were one option. Direct payments - like the federal Climate Action Incentive payments Ontario residents receive annually (and soon quarterly) from fuel charge revenues - were another. They could even have copied Washington state's (ultimately unsuccessful) plan and reduced sales taxes.
The Ford government had various options by which they could have ensured the province's carbon pricing program did not create new costs for Ontarians. Ultimately, with respect to industrial emissions, they chose the option whereby they will be keeping your money.

Full text: 20 people who took on the biggest job of the pandemic and helped Ontario get its shots, Dec. 26
I am delighted you decided to profile vaccine heroes from this past year - the 20 individuals you highlighted deserve the recognition and so much more.
However, there is one group that received no attention on your list but was responsible for the majority of vaccines going into arms across the province: local public health units. I am, of course, a biased observer. It is 9:30 p.m. on Boxing Day and my wife, a senior public health official in the GTHA, is back at her desk meeting with her team, so that tomorrow's rollout and the continued expansion of capacity go smoothly.
These people have worked their tails off to get the province vaccinated: The Medical Officers of Health and their Associates trying to implement sometimes-impossible policy from the province; the auditors seconded to track vaccine inventory; the nurses working extra shifts to administer vaccines; the managers who suddenly had to train and supervise orders of magnitude more staff than ever before.
I think at least one of them deserved to make your top 20 vaccine heroes.
Robbie Brydon, Burlington
Leadership role of public health needs to be acknowledged
20 people who took on the biggest job of the pandemic and helped Ontario get its shots, Dec. 26
It is inspiring to read about vaccine heroes - 20 individuals, some publicly known and others not so much - but all eminently worthy and representative of numerous others who played similar roles for their communities, the province and the country in getting Ontario vaccinated against COVID.
The leadership role of public health in the response to COVID needs to be acknowledged; in particular leadership in the vaccination campaign. It is public health professionals that are a trusted source of information on vaccines for the public and the media. Public health has been there all along for COVID, and it needs to be counted.
Bill Mindell, Barrie, Ont.
Shortages of health workers is only going to get worse
Dr. Kieran Moore, Ontario's chief medical officer, has said that if staff with exposure to COVID-19 and who are asymptomatic do not go to work, this will result in a 20 per cent to 30 per cent rate of absenteeism.
So what does this mean? I have a close family member who is a nurse and this person is finding that some of their asymptomatic colleagues who live with someone who has COVID-19 are coming into work. With this happening, and the fact Omicron is airborne and so much more transmissible, this means more and more nurses will test positive until there are very few nurses left to come into work. Who will be left to look after the patients?
This policy of those working with exposure to already infected individuals will only exacerbate the shortage of health-care workers in our hospitals.
Janet Ball, Thornhill
Why aren't COVID vaccines made mandatory for all?
Dave Healey, a fully vaccinated historical interpreter in city museums, has taken an unplanned retirement due to the fact that people coming into the museums are not required to be vaccinated. I fully understand his concern, as I am a firm believer in vaccinations.
The same goes for restaurants. Why do patrons of restaurants have to be vaccinated and show proof but the staff does not? Are we allowed to ask the staff who is waiting on us for their proof of vaccination? I don't think so; it makes no sense whatsoever. What is wrong with our provincial government? Why aren't vaccines mandatory?
Brenda Nash, Etobicoke
Don't expect our leaders to do the right thing on jabs
The time has come to mandate vaccinations, Dec. 28
Letter writer Gordon Wilson is absolutely right to demand mandated vaccinations across the board.
The problem is, the person he expects to do this - the prime minister - has zero power in most of the areas where it should be done. Hospitals, long-term-care homes, schools, daycares, malls, restaurants, large venues - indeed all public spaces except for a handful of federally regulated areas such as trains, airlines and banking - come under provincial jurisdiction.
The people to ask to "do your duty" are the premiers, people like Ontario's Doug Ford and Alberta's Jason Kenney. Good luck with that.
Patricia Wilmot, Toronto
Our hospitals should not discriminate
While I agree with the writer from Port Rowan that everyone should be vaccinated, his position on refusing the unvaccinated admission to hospitals lacks compassion.
As a triple vaccinated person, I too fail to see a person's hesitancy to vaccinate. However, our hospitals are publicly run and should not discriminate. We don't turn away lung cancer patients because the smoked, nor do we turn away others with lifestyle diseases.
No one deserves to die from this pandemic, even if I think they have made a bad choice.
Barry Stevens, Mississauga

Full text: Ford cares about developers, not the environment
'Something is stirring in suburban Ontario': new survey finds most 905ers believe the Greenbelt is no place for a major highway, Dec. 29
This was a great article by Gideon Forman and Maham Kaleem; it was right to the point and direct. However, I would like to see the Star make this topic front-page news on a regular basis.
We have to get 100 per cent of Ontarians behind this battle so they vote against it in the next election.
Premier Doug Ford is always pushing agendas which only benefit him and developers. He is not looking out for the needs of people, climate and green spaces, which are all necessary for the survival of all species.
Chris Andrews,Vaughan
Thank you to hospital staff
In the past week, I've spent about 30 hours as an outpatient at Toronto Western Hospital, twice through emergency and then to the eye clinic.
We've all heard about the extraordinary work being done day in, night out by the staff of our hospitals. I got to see it first hand and I've never felt more thankful, more humble or more admiring in my life. From the cheery hello at the door, to the polite questions of the triage team and the slow, steady movement of patients, everything orderly and everyone calm.
Saying thank you isn't enough, although I said it over and over. Thank you for the clean rooms, the polite staff, the cheery security crew, the interns, the doctors, the nurses and so on. The people on the front lines from the very beginning of this mess can never be truly thanked enough for all they've done.
Thank you, Toronto Western Hospital, from the bottom of my heart.

North American automakers are too slow on safety
The limit's 100 km/h. So why should any new car let you go twice that? Dec. 29
An article from AutoTrader in the U.K. states all new vehicles sold in Europe will be fitted with a speed limiter as a legal requirement from July 6, 2022.
It says: "The speed limiter technology, called Intelligent Speed Assistant (ISA) uses GPS data and/or traffic-sign-recognition cameras to determine the maximum speed allowed in an area. The system then limits the engine's power and the vehicle's speed to that limit."
The legislation also requires, among other safety equipment, built-in breathalyzers that won't let you start the car if you fail.
In North America, we need to mandate that all vehicles be fitted with speed limiters, with the limit set from the current road speed limit, and with built-in breathalyzers to prevent a vehicle from operating if the driver fails the breath test.
These features will prevent accidents rather than simply reducing injury in case of accident, as do seatbelts, and will cost less than seatbelts.
William Lynn, Toronto
Star's spotlight on luxury homes
is offensive
Luxury condos in Rosedale and a $7.5-million "home of the week?" And featured in the same issue of the Toronto Star as an article about how several Torontonians have become homeless?
I find this offensive, given the housing crisis in many areas of Canada.
This reporting activates my gag reflex and I fail to see how it reflects any one of five relevant Atkinson Principles, which the Star cites as its "intellectual foundation."
More newsworthy articles might be about uber-rich developers building affordable housing that is affordable in practice, and not just in name.
Raised by Depression-era parents, I learned the value of frugality and the wisdom contained in the adage: "There are two ways to get enough: one is to get more and the other is to desire less."
Please stop promoting the self-indulgent lifestyles of the rich and famous to which few of us can relate, or understand.

Full text: The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Monday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available .
7:35 p.m.: Students, parents and teachers in Ontario are bracing for another stint of virtual education after the province announced Monday that schools would not reopen to in-person classes for at least two weeks due to the recent surge in COVID-19 cases.
Premier Doug Ford announced the shift to remote learning less than a week after his government insisted in-person classes would resume after only a two-day delay. That planned return to class — originally slated for Wednesday — will now take place no earlier than Jan. 17, though the province has said that date will be reassessed based on public health indicators.
Ford said the two-week pause on in-person classes would provide “much-needed time" for vaccines and public health measures to blunt soaring daily case counts, which reached record highs above 18,000 on the first day of the new year.
“I know online learning isn’t ideal, but above all else, I want to provide parents and students with certainty, not the turmoil of school closures because not enough staff are available to teach our kids,” the premier added.
The move to virtual classrooms had been anticipated in some quarters. Before the winter break, several school boards in the province had proactively asked students to take home their personal belongings and electronic devices as they prepared for the possibility of a switch to remote learning in 2022.
But the latest announcement still came as a disappointment for Toronto parent Lauren Bondar, who called the delayed return to in-person schooling “really devastating.”
Bondar said her six-year-old son had a tough time learning when teaching was done remotely earlier in the pandemic and that she’s worried another school closure will be equally detrimental to his learning.
“We are jeopardizing an entire generation’s education and development,” she said in a phone interview.
Bondar acknowledged that while she can work from home and look after her son while doing so, not all parents can.
“I'm fortunate that I work from home and fortunate that I have flexibility to support him to the best of my abilities. And that is something that many, many, many parents cannot say across the province,” she said.
7:30 p.m.: B.C. is reporting 9,332 new cases of COVID-19 since Friday.
Health officials say there are now 264,181 active cases in the province.
The health ministry on Friday reduced the requirement to self-isolate after testing positive for COVID-19 to five days for fully vaccinated people without symptoms.
It is encouraging people to wear a mask around others for an additional five days after leaving self-isolation.
The ministry said people who haven't been vaccinated are still required to self-isolate for 10 days.
It was also announced that visits to long-term care and assisted living facilities will be limited to essential visitors and the restriction would be re-evaluated on Jan. 18, when other COVID-19 rules are set to expire.
6:03 p.m.: Newfoundland and Labrador officials are imposing stricter provincewide public health measures as the Omicron variant of COVID-19 strains health-care capacity and drives skyrocketing case counts.
During a press briefing Monday, the province’s chief medical officer of health said active case counts have jumped from 30 to nearly 3,000 in about two weeks, overwhelming public health’s capacity for case investigation.
“Identifying every case and contact, that is no longer possible, and our objective right now is to slow the inevitable spread,” Dr. Janice Fitzgerald told reporters in St. John’s.
“The reality of this virus is that it is so infectious, most people will acquire it.”
Anyone who has symptoms of COVID-19 and is considered a close contact of a known case should forego a polymerase chain reaction test and assume they have the virus, she added.
To prevent everyone getting sick at the same time, the province will move to more restrictive public health measures requiring households to stick to 10 close contacts, Fitzgerald said. Group and team sports are suspended, dancing in clubs and other venues is prohibited and funerals, burials and weddings must have fewer than 50 attendees or take place in a venue operating at 25 per cent capacity.
Fitzgerald reported 519 new cases of COVID-19, as well as the province’s 20th death from the virus. There are 2,925 active reported cases and one person is in hospital because of the disease, she said. Test positivity rates are hovering around 10 per cent.
She said 125 of the new cases Monday were in the Labrador-Grenfell Health Authority region, where COVID-19 has reached communities along Labrador’s remote north coast for the first time since the pandemic emerged in the spring of 2020. With 502 cases, the region is home to the highest per capita rate of infections in the province.
5:48 p.m.: Provinces are putting new measures in place to deal with an Omicron-fuelled rise in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, including delaying in-person schooling in Ontario by two weeks and bringing in the military to help Quebec speed up its third-dose vaccination program.
Ontario joined a number of jurisdictions that already announced a postponed return to in-person learning, declaring the delay Monday along with a slew of new restrictions that puts the province back into a “modified Step 2” of pandemic recovery as of Wednesday.
Premier Doug Ford said in a news conference that virtual learning will replace in-person classes until Jan. 17. The news backtracked on an announcement made last week that in-person classes would resume this Wednesday.
“With the new variant, the ground is shifting every single day,” Ford said. “The level of absenteeism we’re seeing in other sectors tells us with absolute certainty that operating schools and ensuring teachers are on the job and not home sick will be a challenge we cannot overcome in the short term.”
Ontario said 1,232 people were hospitalized with COVID-19 on Monday, including 248 patients in intensive care units.
The province reported 13,578 new COVID-19 cases on Monday, though experts have said the restricted eligibility for PCR testing Ontario announced last week means that number is likely much higher.
Newfoundland and Labrador also announced new restrictions Monday, placing the province in “Alert Level 4” as chief medical officer of health Dr. Janice Fitzgerald urged residents to keep non-essential contacts low.
The province’s new plan, which includes further capacity restrictions at gyms and restaurants, will be re-assessed on Jan. 17.
Fitzgerald noted that active cases in Newfoundland have increased from 30 to nearly 3,000 in the last two weeks, adding that anyone with symptoms after close contact with a known case should forego a PCR test and assume they have the virus.
Newfoundland reported 519 new COVID-19 cases on Monday.
“At this point, the sheer number of cases is overwhelming public health capacity for case investigation,” Fitzgerald said. “This means we do not have the epidemiological data to show where the spread is or is not occurring.”
Meanwhile, federal Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said on Twitter Monday that members of the Canadian Armed Forces will be deployed to Quebec to speed up the province’s vaccination efforts. Quebec’s booster program is set to expand Tuesday to those 18 and older.
Up to 200 personnel are being deployed at vaccination centres in Montreal, the Defence Department said in a statement.
In-person classes are already delayed until Jan. 17 in Quebec, where a curfew came into effect on New Year’s Eve to help ease record-high cases.
The province reported 15,293 new cases on Monday. It also logged 1,396 hospitalizations, including 181 patients in intensive care, and 15 additional deaths.
Alberta, Nova Scotia and British Columbia all previously announced delays for the return of in-person learning, with a targeted Jan. 10 start date. Manitoba, which expected students to return on Jan. 6 following the holiday break, later extended that to the 10th.
But calls to delay that further have already begun.
The Manitoba Teachers’ Society issued a statement Dec. 31 urging the province to move schools to “Code Red” status for the month of January, putting remote learning back into effect amid Omicron’s rapid spread.
Manitoba health officials said Monday that case counts surged by thousands since the last update on Dec. 31.
The province said there are now 15,318 active cases in the province, up from 9,924 reported on Friday. That figure includes 1,721 new infections logged on Sunday.
Ontario’s lengthy list of what Ford called “targetted and time-limited” restrictions include reducing social gathering limits to five people indoors and 10 outdoors, closing indoor dining at restaurants and bars and shuttering indoor concert venues, theatres, cinemas and gyms.
Health minister Christine Elliott said the measures would be in place for at least 21 days, adding that the rapid rise of Omicron cases combined with a hospital staff shortage due to infection and exposure, could threaten hospital capacity “if further action isn’t taken to curb transmission.”
“As the evidence on Omicron continues to evolve, our pandemic response must evolve with it,” she said.
Health officials in Nova Scotia reported 1,020 new cases of COVID-19 Monday, including 36 people in hospital. The province also expanded booster eligibility for those over the age of 30.
Top doctor Robert Strang said he was cautiously encouraged by the province’s low hospitalization rate, but warned things could change quickly.
“Right now we can’t justify a stricter lockdown, but nor can we justify throwing the doors wide open,” Strang said, adding Nova Scotians could “accept a fair degree of spread” in order to continue seeing small groups of family and friends and attend school.
“However, we also have to work together to slow the spread of the Omicron variant to protect the vulnerable people in the health-care system.”
COVID-19 activity has also been surging in Yukon, with the territory reporting 158 new cases since Friday and a 32 per cent test positivity rate.
Meanwhile, Supreme and provincial courts said they are postponing in-person trials in British Columbia this week as they work with public health officials to update their COVID-19 safety policies.
In Alberta, new, shortened isolation measures began Monday. People with at least two doses of vaccine who test positive for COVID-19 only need to isolate for five days instead of 10.
The five-day isolation period is similar to recommendations recently announced in Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick and B.C. Symptoms must be fully resolved by the end of the five-day period, otherwise people must continue to isolate.
Federal Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau tweeted Monday she had tested positive for COVID-19 despite spending the holiday season quietly at home.
Bibeau said she is following public health guidance and continuing to work virtually through her isolation.
“My symptoms are mild,” she said. “I want to emphasize how important it is to get vaccinated and thank the health workers working hard to get us through this wave.”
5:41 p.m.: The NBA has rescheduled all 11 games that were postponed in December for virus-related reasons and either shifted the times or dates of 10 other games to help accommodate those changes.
Toronto had six games affected, Chicago had five and Brooklyn had four. In all, 18 of the league’s 30 teams had at least one game date changed by the postponements or future adjustments, all of which were revealed Monday.
There are now seven teams that have at least one stint of playing four games in five nights: Chicago, Toronto, Brooklyn, Cleveland, Miami, New Orleans and Denver. The original NBA schedule didn't call for any such stretches, though it was unavoidable with the changes.
“The objective and priority here was to avoid teams playing three games in three nights and look for a middle-ground approach," said Evan Wasch, an NBA vice president who helps oversee the league's scheduling.
The Nets — who couldn’t play at Portland last month because they were missing nearly a dozen players with virus-related issues — have a most unusual schedule coming next week.
Brooklyn plays Sunday against San Antonio at home — then will fly across the country to play the rescheduled game at Portland the next day, Jan. 10. The Nets then come back East and visit Chicago on Jan. 12.
To help with the demands of that Portland trip, the NBA moved Sunday’s Spurs-at-Nets game to noon Eastern. The teams had been scheduled to play a night game, but now the Nets should be in Portland by late Sunday night.
There were a couple other options for that Nets-Blazers game, Wasch said, but having it played Jan. 10 was the best for everyone involved.
5:35 p.m.: Manitoba’s number of active COVID-19 infections has swelled by thousands since the last update on New Year’s Eve.
The province updated its online dashboard Monday, noting there have been 1,721 new cases in the previous day.
It says there are now 15,318 active cases in the province, up from 9,924 reported on Friday.
Hospitalizations jumped from 192 on Friday to 228 on Monday, and the number of patients in intensive care has also grown.
The dashboard says there are now 32 COVID-19 patients in intensive care, up from 30 on Dec. 31.
Six more people have died since Friday, and the province is reporting a test-positivity rate of 37.9 per cent.
5:10 p.m.: Public health officials in New Brunswick are reporting 2,548 new cases of COVID-19 cases over the past three days.
In a news release, officials say they logged 797 new cases on Saturday, 829 on Sunday and 922 infections today.
They say 51 people are in hospital due to COVID-19, and 17 of those patents are in intensive care while 12 people are on a ventilator.
The release says more than 500 heath-care workers in the province are now isolating because of COVID-19.
New Brunswick is limiting availability of polymerase chain reaction testing to high-risk individuals, including symptomatic people over 50 and under the age of two, to grapple with the strain on its resources.
Officials say rapid tests will be used for people under 50 who are experiencing symptoms, and positive results will be treated as a case and must be registered online.
5:07 p.m.: Dr. Anthony Fauci said the new year is bringing bad news as the highly transmissible omicron variant powers a “vertical spike” in COVID-19 cases.
But even as omicron drives the worst caseloads of the entire pandemic, Fauci believes the wave could peak quickly.
“Cases are not going up gradually, they are going straight up,” Fauci told WPIX TV on Monday. “What we are hoping is you reach a peak and the cases come down rather quickly.”
The meteoric rise and fall in omicron cases is what doctors experienced in South Africa, where the new strain was first identified in late November.
Despite being much more contagious, omicron appears to cause less serious disease for the vaccinated than previous strains of COVID-19. And those who survive it will have some refreshed protection from other forms of the virus that are circulating.
That’s a great sign for eventually getting the pandemic under control, but first, the U.S. will have to endure a rough few weeks or more.
“The promising news is we have the tools to get out of it sooner than later,” said Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the chief medical adviser to the president.
Following howls of protest by medical personnel, Fauci defended the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recently issued guidance allowing those who test positive for COVID-19 but who are asymptomatic to return to work after isolating for five days, instead of the previous 10 days.
Along with evolving clinical science about how long COVID-19 patients stay contagious, he cited the need to avoid a collapse of essential services if millions of workers are sidelined.
“You got to make sure that society remains functional,” he said. “You try to strike a balance.”
Fauci said he remained concerned about how the tens of millions of unvaccinated Americans will cope with omicron.
But he admitted being hopeful that the protection from widespread infection combined with the relatively large share of the population that is vaccinated and boosted will allow the country to finally turn the corner in the seemingly never-ending fight to end the pandemic.
“You would hope there would be enough background protection in the population to prevent these massive outbreaks,” he said.
4:51 p.m.: The federal government released new recommendations last month for unvaccinated students exposed to the coronavirus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said those students could remain in school, as long as they are tested for the virus twice in the week after exposure and both tests come back negative.
The latest guidance, known as the “test-to-stay” protocol, aims to minimize disruptions to learning as two highly contagious variants of the virus, delta and omicron, spread across the United States, causing some school closures and threatening to upend the strategies that federal and state officials adopted to return to in-person classes in the fall.
Although some schools and districts are already using the test-to-stay approach, the CDC had not previously endorsed it, citing a lack of evidence. Last month, the agency released studies from two counties, one in California and the other in Illinois, that effectively tested the protocol and found that it worked.
The studies were conducted before the fast-moving omicron variant began spreading in the United States. Scientists are still investigating many basic questions about the variant, including whether it increases the risk of in-school transmission.
The new policy, hinted at in the winter COVID-19 plan that President Joe Biden unveiled last month, still calls on students to wear masks and socially distance, and applies only to those who remain asymptomatic. Until now, unvaccinated students were expected to quarantine at home for as long as two weeks after exposure. Some states have had tens of thousands of students in quarantine.
Vaccinated students with exposures have generally been allowed to remain in school as long as they are asymptomatic and wear a mask.
4:34 p.m.: Nova Scotia’s top doctor said he’s cautiously encouraged by the province’s low hospitalization rate for COVID-19, but warned Monday that things could change very quickly.
Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Robert Strang did not introduce any new public health measures, but he did emphasize that people must continue to follow public health advice, get vaccinated and get tested if they think they have the virus.
Though the province reported 1,020 new cases of COVID-19 Monday — a figure Premier Tim Houston called “breathtaking” — Strang said he couldn’t justify imposing a stricter lockdown.
“We can accept a fair degree of spread of the virus to allow us to continue to do some of the things that protect our mental and emotional well being and minimize financial impacts,” Strang told reporters during a briefing in Halifax. “However, we also have to work together to slow the spread of the Omicron variant to protect vulnerable people in the health care system.”
Houston, who joined Strang via teleconference for the briefing, said there are 36 people in the province hospitalized because of COVID-19, and 31 of those patients were admitted since the Omicron variant was first detected last month. Of those hospitalized patients, over 77 per cent are vaccinated, and they range in age from 19 to 98, Houston said.
“To date, two things so far remain consistent,” he said. “This variant appears less severe, but the volume is certainly breathtaking. And the second thing is, the vaccines work to reduce severe illness.”
Though public health did not provide the number of reported active cases on Monday, online government data shows less than one per cent of people in the province with COVID-19 were hospitalized as of Dec. 31.
By comparison, the province logged 6,067 cases from March 15 to Nov. 9. Data shows 314 of those patients were hospitalized, for a rate of five per cent.
Strang said hundreds of health-care workers, both in the hospital and long-term care system, are having to stay home either because they’re sick with the variant or they’ve been identified as a close contact.
“So the health-care system is managing the hospitalizations for now,” he added. “But there are substantive operational impacts that are occurring throughout the system.”
Public health is reviewing its isolation requirements for those who have been identified as a close contact of a COVID-19 case, and an announcement about any changes will likely be made Wednesday, he said.
On Monday, the province also opened up its booster shot eligibility to anyone aged 30 and older, and who received their second dose of a vaccine at least six months ago. Houston said 92,000 booster appointments were posted Monday and promptly filled.
“You certainly came out in droves. Thank you for that,” he said. “More appointments are coming.”
4:33 p.m.: Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday said he’s waiting on the federal government to send COVID-19 treatments to re-establish sites for residents to combat the virus. He also blamed the federal government for a shortage of COVID-19 tests that have led to long lines at testing centers and runs on at-home testing kits as the omicron variant of the virus courses through the state.
“We will turn on additional sites as soon as the federal government gives us the supply,” DeSantis told reporters at a Fort Lauderdale hospital, adding that between 30,000 and 40,000 doses of monoclonal antibody treatments have been pledged. “It’s all locked and loaded; it’s just a matter of the federal government giving us more doses.”
DeSantis didn’t say when he expects the doses to arrive but said he’ll set up treatment sites in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties as well as a site in Central Florida “the next day.”
DeSantis criticized an earlier decision by President Joe Biden’s administration to withhold some monoclonal antibody doses to states because initial data in some studies show they aren’t as effective against the omicron variant as they are against the delta variant.
Florida Surgeon General Joe Ladapo wrote to the Health and Human Services Department last week, noting the delta variant is still infecting residents. The agency later said it would continue to send the treatments, but they haven’t yet arrived.
DeSantis also chided the Biden administration for what he called the testing “crunch” and said Ladapo will be putting out guidance on who should get tested that focuses on patients who would be more likely to suffer severe symptoms, such as the elderly and those with preexisting conditions.
Ladapo said the guidance wouldn’t “restrict access to testing” but would seek to “unwind the testing psychology that our federal leadership has managed to unfortunately get most of the country in over the last two years.”
“We need to unwind this testing – planning and living one’s life around testing,” he added. “Without it we’re going to be stuck in this same cycle. It’s time for people to be living.”
4:27 p.m.: Ontario business owners were fretting about the future of their companies as workers braced for layoffs after the province levied new COVID-19 measures forcing some to close their doors temporarily and others to limit visitors.
The latest public health measures announced by Ontario Premier Doug Ford on Monday require restaurants and bars to halt indoor dining and cease selling alcohol after 10 p.m. starting on Wednesday.
Retail settings, including shopping malls and personal care services, must reduce their capacity to 50 per cent, while indoor concert venues, theatres, cinemas, museums, galleries and other attractions are required to close.
The policies meant to curtail the province’s soaring COVID-19 cases are expected to remain in place until at least Jan. 26, but businesses fear even three weeks of closures will result in lost income and layoffs and exacerbate existing labour shortages and mounting costs.
“I’m just in the middle of nowhere right now. I am really disappointed,” said Andy Page, the owner of Tomyum Restaurant and Wine Bar in Toronto.
“Every day I open my eyes and I see a whole bunch of bills just waiting for me to pay and a lot of people ask me why I still carry on. To be honest, it’s because I have no backup plan.”
More weeks closed will mean the bills — already high from rising inflation rates — will mount even further and Page will have to work harder to retain the staff he managed to hire in a tight labour market.
The Ontario government tried to ease some of those financial tensions on Monday with an expanded rebate program for businesses affected by the new slate of closures.
Certain businesses ordered to close will be reimbursed for 100 per cent of property tax and energy costs, it said, while ones required to reduce capacity to 50 per cent will receive a rebate payment for half those expenses.
4:05 p.m.: Yukon is reporting that COVID-19 case counts are on the rise, with 158 new infections recorded since Friday.
The acting Chief Medical Officer says in a statement that the territory now has a total of 245 active cases and a 32 per cent test positivity rate.
Dr. Catherine Elliott is urging the public to stay home if they feel sick with even the mildest symptoms.
Yukon also announced new public health measures on New Year’s Eve that are set to begin on Jan. 7 in an attempt to curb the spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant.
They include limiting indoor personal gatheringsto 10 people, capping outdoor gatherings at 25 people, and restricting organized indoor gatherings to 50 per cent of a venue’s capacity while requiring proof of vaccination.
Restaurants, bars and nightclubs will also be limited to serving a total of six people per table with proof of vaccination, and all public saunas and steam rooms are being ordered to close.
3:52 p.m.: One of the largest Quebec daycare unions is condemning the province’s latest measure shortening the recommended isolation periods for asymptomatic staff and kids who have contact with positive cases of COVID-19.
The Fédération des intervenantes en petite enfance du Québec, which represents 3,200 members, is asking the government to suspend the recommendation.
The news comes as Montreal public health announced it is putting off the measure for now.
Jean-Nicolas Aubé, a spokesperson for one of Montreal’s public health authorities, says they are in talks with the government regarding the situation.
Quebec had recommended on Dec. 30 that daycare employees and children who were in contact with a COVID-19 positive case not be required to get a test, if they were asymptomatic.
The government also says employees and children can continue to attend daycares, with some exceptions such as if a member of their household has tested positive for COVID-19.
3:32 p.m.: Quebec reported 15,293 new COVID-19 cases on Monday and 15 more deaths linked to the virus, as Canada’s public safety minister announced members of the Canadian Armed Forces will be mobilized to speed up the province’s vaccination efforts.
Bill Blair made the announcement on Twitter Monday morning, saying the decision followed a request for aid from the province.
“Following our approval of Quebec’s request for federal assistance, Canadian Armed Forces personnel will begin their deployment today to provide support to the province’s vaccination campaign,” he said.
The Defence Department said in a statement that up to 200 personnel are being deployed at vaccination centres in Montreal.
“For the moment, it’s just in the region of Montreal that the forces are being deployed,” said Daniel Minden, a spokesperson for Defence Minister Anita Anand.
The news came a day before Quebec was set to expand eligibility for a COVID-19 booster vaccine to the entire adult population.
Getting booster shots into Quebecers’ arms has become a priority as the province confronts the highly contagious Omicron variant, with hospitalizations and positive case counts rising over the holidays.
The Health Department said on Monday the number of hospitalizations linked to the virus rose by 165 to 1,396. It said 181 people were in intensive care, an increase of 19, while 47,386 COVID-19 tests were analyzed and 30.2 per cent came back positive.
Those 18 and over will be able to book appointments to receive a third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine throughout January, following a new rollout by age group.
3:29 p.m.: Some school systems around the U.S. extended their holiday break Monday or switched back to online instruction because of the explosion in COVID-19 cases, while others pressed ahead with in-person classes amid a seemingly growing sense that Americans will have to learn to co-exist with the virus.
Caught between pleas from teachers fearful of infection and parents who want their children in class, school districts in cities such as Milwaukee, New York, Detroit and beyond found themselves in a difficult position at the start of the second half of the academic year because of the super-contagious omicron variant.
New York City, home of the nation’s largest public school system, reopened classrooms to roughly 1 million students with a stock of take-home COVID-19 test kits and plans to double the number of random tests done in schools.
“We are going to be safe, and we will be open to educate our children,” newly sworn-in Mayor Eric Adams said on MSNBC.
New Yorker Trisha White said that she feels the risk is the same for her 9-year-old son in or out of school and that being with classmates is far better for him than remote learning.
“He could get the virus outside of school,” she said as she dropped the boy off. “So what can you do? You know, I wouldn’t blame the school system. They’re trying their best.”
While the teachers union had asked the mayor to postpone in-person learning for a week, city officials have long said that mask requirements, testing and other safety measures mean that children are safe in school. The city also has a vaccination mandate for employees.
New cases of COVID-19 in the city shot up from a daily average of about 17,000 in the week before the holidays to nearly 37,000 last week.
New COVID-19 cases in the U.S. have tripled in the past two weeks to over 400,000 a day, the highest level on record, amid a rush by many Americans to get tested. The outbreak is putting a heavy burden on vital sectors of the economy, including hospitals and the airline industry, which are seeing large numbers of employees infected.
3:21 p.m.: An Ontario First Nation is requesting military assistance amid a COVID-19 outbreak that has infected half of its on-reserve population and “crippled” daily operations.
Bearskin Lake First Nation says 174 people have tested positive, including people in essential jobs with administration and maintenance units for the band.
The First Nation says most households are quarantining and need deliveries of food, water, chopped wood and medication, and the community does not have space to host testing or isolation centres.
Chief Lefty Kamenawatamin says resources are being stretched to a breaking point.
Kamenawatamin says the community has asked for financial support from the federal government but resources offered so far have been “minimal.”
The community 425 kilometres north of Sioux Lookout, Ont., declared a state of emergency last week due to the outbreak.
3:11 p.m.: Health officials in Prince Edward Island are reporting 161 new cases of COVID-19 as the Omicron variant rips through the province.
Less than two weeks ago on Christmas Eve, the province reported 40 cases and flagged the figure as a new record.
A government news release today says there are 995 active reported infections on the Island.
It says three people are in hospital due to COVID-19, one of whom is in intensive care.
Officials say four other people who were in hospital for other reasons have since tested positive for COVID-19.
Because of the increased demand and resulting pressure on its health-care system, Prince Edward Island is only offering polymerase chain reaction testing to select groups, including those with symptoms of COVID-19 and those identified as contacts of a known infection.
2 p.m.: Newfoundland and Labrador also announced new restrictions Monday, placing the province in “Alert Level 4,” as chief medical officer of health Dr. Janice Fitzgerald urged residents to keep non-essential contacts low.
Gyms and restaurants will operate under stricter capacity restrictions — 25 per cent or 50 people for fitness centres and 50 per cent for dining establishments with a maximum of six patrons per table. Organized team sports are cancelled under Newfoundland’s new plan, which Fitzgerald said would be re-assessed in two weeks.
1:45 p.m.: British Columbia’s Supreme and provincial courts are postponing in-person trials this week as they work with public health officials to update their COVID-19 safety policies.
The courts say in a written statement that all in-person civil and family matters scheduled between Jan. 4 and Jan. 7 will be postponed due to “the rapid and concerning recent increase in COVID-19 in the province,” but all virtual proceedings will continue as planned.
The Supreme Court is asking all lawyers and accused people with scheduled appearances this week to phone the court at the time of their proceeding to arrange a new date.
1:30 p.m.: Canada’s Mark McMorris expects the Beijing Olympics will go ahead as planned.
The world-class snowboarder says he doesn’t think organizers will postpone the upcoming Winter Games, even as COVID-19 numbers surge worldwide.
McMorris says it’s likely too late to delay the Olympics scheduled in Beijing for the first three weeks of February.
The 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo were delayed one year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
1:15 p.m.: Chicago teachers are expected to vote Tuesday on whether to defy Chicago Public Schools’ orders to return to classrooms amid a spike in city COVID-19 cases.
The Chicago Teachers Union’s governing body — the 600-member House of Delegates — is expected to meet Tuesday. All of the union’s 25,000 members are slated to receive an electronic ballot asking if they support working remotely instead of in person starting Wednesday.
“I am so pissed off that we have to continuously fight for the basic necessities, the basic mitigations,” CTU Vice President Stacy Davis Gates said Monday at a South Side news conference outside Park Manor Elementary School, where some teachers said they planned to work from home because of safety concerns.
1:05 p.m.: Canada’s public safety minister says members of the Canadian Armed Forces will be deployed to Quebec starting Monday to speed up the province’s vaccination efforts.
Bill Blair made the announcement on Twitter this morning, saying the decision was made as a result of a request for aid from the province.
The news comes a day before Quebec is set to start expanding eligibility for a COVID-19 booster vaccine to the entire adult population.
Getting booster shots into Quebecers’ arms has become a priority as the province grapples with the highly contagious Omicron variant, with hospitalizations and positive case counts skyrocketing over the holidays.
1 p.m.: Toronto Maple Leafs star centre Auston Matthews and assistant coach Dean Chynoweth were held out of Monday’s practice for what the team called “precautionary reasons.”
The Leafs announced the absences on Twitter, but did not provide further details.
Toronto has been working through a COVID-19 outbreak that saw 14 players and seven staff members placed in the NHL’s coronavirus protocol at its height. Leafs defenceman Timothy Liljegren was the only player still in isolation when they beat the visiting Ottawa Senators 6-0 on Saturday.
11:50 a.m.: Quebec has updated its list of curfew exemptions to allow dog walking during hours when residents are otherwise expected to remain indoors.
The province says that between the hours of 10 p.m. and 5 a.m., the hours covered by the most recent curfew imposed to contain the spread of COVID-19, Quebecers can take their dogs out within a radius of no more than one kilometre from their permanent or temporary residence.
The new exemption, which was updated on Sunday according to a government portal, comes in response to backlash from pet owners denouncing the lack of provisions for dog walking when the curfew first took effect on Dec. 31.
This is the second time the province is facing such a measure after a previous curfew introduced in early January 2021 was in effect for more than five months.
11:10 a.m.: In an about-face triggered by the Omicron surge, Premier Doug Ford is ordering schools to do virtual learning for at least the next two weeks and imposing other COVID-19 restrictions, such as a 21-day temporary ban on indoor restaurant dining.
“As we continue with our provincial vaccine booster efforts, we must look at every option to slow the spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant,” the premier told reporters at Queen’s Park on Monday.
“Putting these targeted and time limited measures in place will give us more opportunity to deliver vaccines to all Ontarians and ensure everyone has maximum protection against this virus.”

10:52 a.m.: The Ottawa Senators have placed defenceman Thomas Chabot, forwards Zach Sanford and Chris Tierney and assistant coach Bob Jones in the NHL’s COVID-19 protocol.
Ottawa now has nine players in the protocol. Chabot, Tierney and Sanford join goaltender Anton Forsberg, forwards Josh Norris, Tyler Ennis and Nick Paul and defencemen Dillon Heatherington and Jacob Bernard-Docker.
This is the second significant outbreak of COVID-19 on the Senators this season. The team had three of its games postponed in November after 10 players entered the league’s COVID-19 protocol.
10:45 a.m . Kyro Maseh, one of the Star’s vaccine heroes of 2021 , is offering vaccines to educators only on Monday only ahead of the opening of schools. Pharmsave on Kingston road near Victoria Park is attracting of hundreds of instructors from all over the city who are braving the frigid temperatures for the shot. The clinic is slated to take place from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.
10:35 a.m. The U.S. is expanding COVID-19 boosters as it confronts the Omicron surge, with the Food and Drug Administration allowing extra Pfizer shots for children as young as 12.
Boosters already are recommended for everyone 16 and older, and federal regulators on Monday decided they’re also warranted for 12- to 15-year-olds once enough time has passed since their last dose.
But the move, coming as classes restart after the holidays, isn’t the final step. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must decide whether to recommend boosters for the younger teens. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the CDC’s director, is expected to rule later this week.
The FDA also said everyone 12 and older who’s eligible for a Pfizer booster can get one as early as five months after their last dose rather than six months.
10:20 a.m. Ontario is reporting 1,232 people hospitalized with COVID-19 and 248 in the ICU; at least 13,578 new COVID-19 cases have been reported, according to Health Minister Christine Elliott.
The seven-day rolling average of COVID-19 related patients in ICU is 210.
Not all hospitals report on weekends. Public Health Ontario says the number of infected people is likely higher due to recent policy changes which have made COVID-19 testing less accessible.
9:30 a.m. German clubs’ preparations for the Bundesliga’s resumption after the winter break are being hampered by coronavirus infections.
Defending champion Bayern Munich is among those worst affected, with Monday’s training session put back until the late afternoon so players and coaching staff can be tested upon their return.
The team’s return was already delayed by a day after the Bavarian club reported five COVID-19 infections – captain and goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, players Kingsley Coman, Corentin Tolisso and Omar Richards, as well as assistant coach Dino Toppmöller, all tested positive.
It’s unclear if the five are infected with the Omicron variant and whether they will miss Bayern’s game against Borussia Mönchengladbach to resume the league on Friday. Neuer, who said he was suffering from light symptoms, will miss the match.
8:30 a.m. The French government said it will ease access to crisis funds and could delay loan repayments for businesses struggling with a drop in activity as the surge in Omicron cases hits tourism and leisure activities.
“We are standing by firms and workers in difficulty,” Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said after meeting with representatives of business groups. “This method has allowed to relaunch economic activity very quickly and very strongly.”
To access support covering fixed costs, the government will cut the threshold to a 50 per cent loss of revenues from 65 per cent previously and accelerate the process for the smallest companies. The funds will also be made available to the whole tourism sector, including bars and restaurants.
Le Maire said the cost of the new measures would be in the hundreds of millions of euros and easily covered by 1.8 billion euros of unused crisis funds already budgeted.
8:03 a.m. Toronto’s Zanzibar Tavern will be hosting a low barrier booster shot clinic Monday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
7:50 a.m. Schoolchildren returned to classes Monday in parts of Europe, while the British government pledged to rush ventilation units and enough COVID-19 test kits to schools to ensure they, too, can reopen later this week despite soaring infection rates in the UK.
Secondary school students in England also will be required to wear face masks when they return to classes after the Christmas holidays and they could also face merged classes amid staffing shortages.
“The priority is to keep schools open,” British Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi told Sky News. “The testing, the staffing support we’re putting in place, and of course the ventilation is going to make a big difference to schools this year.”
The highly transmissible Omicron variant has caused Britain’s daily new caseload to soar over Christmas and the New Year, with 137,583 infections and 73 deaths reported for England and Wales only on Sunday, with numbers for Scotland and Northern Ireland to be announced after the holiday weekend.
7:20 a.m. (updated) Ontario Premier Doug Ford is scheduled to make an announcement Monday morning at 11 a.m. as the Omicron variant drives record-breaking COVID-19 case numbers in the province.
The province says Health Minister Christine Elliott and Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Kieran Moore are set be in Toronto with Ford.
The CEO of Ontario Health, which oversees the province’s health system, is also scheduled to be on site at Queen’s Park.
Public Health Ontario reported 16,714 COVID-19 cases on Sunday after a record-breaking 18,445 reported the day before.
However, the organization warns that the real case numbers are likely higher due to recent changes making COVID-19 tests less widely accessible.
6:27 a.m.: U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said he tested positive for COVID and plans to quarantine at home for five days, attending meetings virtually when possible.
6:27 a.m.: Russia reported the lowest number of cases since June, while Germany is weighing new measures in the face of rising infections. In Hong Kong, the pace of vaccinations picked up even as the city’s government denied rumours it will shut down borders or suspend dining-in at restaurants. China reported 101 new COVID cases, mostly in Xi’an, where some residents complained of a lack of access to food.
6:25 a.m.: Wintry weather combined with the pandemic to frustrate air travellers whose return flights home from the holidays were cancelled or delayed in the first days of the new year.
The tracking service FlightAware said more than 2,600 U.S. flights and more than 4,400 worldwide were grounded Sunday.
That followed Saturday’s mass cancellations of more than 2,700 U.S. flights, and more than 4,700 worldwide.
Saturday’s single-day U.S. toll of grounded flights was the highest since just before Christmas, when airlines began blaming staffing shortages on increasing COVID-19 infections among crews.
6:25 a.m.: Pandemics do eventually end, even if omicron is complicating the question of when this one will. But it won’t be like flipping a light switch: The world will have to learn to coexist with a virus that’s not going away.
The ultra-contagious omicron mutant is pushing cases to all-time highs and causing chaos as an exhausted world struggles, again, to stem the spread. But this time, we’re not starting from scratch.
Vaccines offer strong protection from serious illness, even if they don’t always prevent a mild infection. Omicron doesn’t appear to be as deadly as some earlier variants. And those who survive it will have some refreshed protection against other forms of the virus that still are circulating — and maybe the next mutant to emerge, too.
The newest variant is a warning about what will continue to happen “unless we really get serious about the endgame,” said Dr. Albert Ko, an infectious disease specialist at the Yale School of Public Health.
6:24 a.m.: Indian health authorities Monday began vaccinating teens in the age group of 15 to 18, as more states started to enforce tighter restrictions to arrest a new surge stoked by the infectious omicron variant.
State governments across India administered doses at schools, hospitals and through special vaccination sites amid a rapid rise in coronavirus infections, particularly in the country’s densely populated cities.
Data from the Health Ministry showed India confirmed over 33,000 new COVID-19 cases in the last 24 hours. Deaths increased by 123, bringing the total to nearly 482,000.
Authorities are saying that even as cases have started to rise rapidly, hospitalizations have not gone up.
“There is no need to panic,” Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of Delhi, said Sunday.
India has so far recorded almost 35 million COVID-19 infections.
6:23 a.m.: Japan’s capital found 103 new coronavirus cases on Monday, the most in nearly three months according to data from the Tokyo government.
The number of serious cases remained at 1. But the seven-day average case load figure rose to 75.7, nearly doubling from the previous week.
While Japan has managed so far to avoid a mass outbreak of the omicron variant, the number of new cases have been creeping up in recent weeks. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has taken a tough approach to border restrictions, which appears to have led to a rise in his approval ratings.
6:23 a.m.: A record 10 million people were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the seven days through Sunday, almost twice the pandemic’s previous weekly high, as Omicron spreads across the globe. Weekly deaths continued to drop.
6:22 a.m.: Is anyone going to CES this year?
A long-simmering question in the tech world will finally get its answer as the influential gadget show returns to the Las Vegas Strip after a hiatus caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
“We know it will be a smaller show this year, for obvious reasons,” said Jean Foster, senior vice president at the Consumer Technology Association, the event’s organizer. Several huge tech companies have abandoned plans to attend in person. The latest sign of its dwindling size was Friday’s announcement that CES will run one day shorter than originally planned.
The sprawling exhibition floors open Wednesday as the spread of COVID-19’s omicron variant has heightened concerns about the safety of indoor events and international travel. The CTA by late December was anticipating between 50,000 and 75,000 attendees for this week’s conference, down from more than 170,000 who came for the last in-person gathering two years ago.
Some diehard CES devotees were mulling over the choice to go or stay home right up until last week.
“An online CES is not a real CES,” said Prince Constantijn of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, in a December interview. “You’ve got to see the products and meet the people.” But a week later, the royal who regularly serves as a special envoy for Dutch technology startups had opted to stay home after all. His country is sending a bare-bones crew to CES 2022. So are many big tech companies — if they send anyone at all.
The last physical CES in January 2020 pumped an estimated $300 million into the Las Vegas economy. Few attendees would have known then about the coronavirus outbreak emerging in central China and still months away from being declared a pandemic. The CTA took the conference online in 2021 as COVID-19 hospitalizations were spiking around the world and vaccines weren’t yet widely available.
6:20 a.m.: Effective today, people in Alberta with at least two doses of vaccine who test positive for COVID-19 will only need to isolate for five days instead of 10.
Health Minister Jason Copping announced the change last week in the face of the rapidly spreading Omicron variant, saying it was based on evidence that fully immunized people have shorter infectious periods.
Symptoms must be fully resolved by the end of the five-day period, otherwise people must continue to isolate.
For five days after isolation, those people will be required to wear a mask around others at all times when in public.
Copping says it will prevent disruptions in the workforce, especially for those who deliver important services.
Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick and British Columbia have also reduced the self-isolation period to five days.
Education Minister Adriana LaGrange also announced last week that in-person classes for kindergarten to Grade 12 students would be delayed until Jan. 10.
She said the longer break would allow school authorities to plan for a successful startup.

Full text: It's generally understood that trying to forecast the future is not only a thankless game, but also a dangerous one.
That said, it is a pretty safe prediction that 2022 will be a pivotal one for Canada's largest residential real estate market and the intensifying housing supply crisis that has shaped it. In the Greater Toronto Area, the "new normal" is defined by multiple offers, bidding wars, a chronic listings shortage, surging demand and soaring prices.
Seasonal variation in demand, something that historically dictated market activity, is now a thing of the past, even in Ontario's recreational market for cottages and secondary residential markets beyond urban borders. Through November, daily showings by agents in the GTA ranged between 16,000 to 20,000. Toward the end of the month, those showings declined only because tight inventory meant there was far less to show. That imbalance is what led to a 15 per cent increase in November 2021 house prices in the GTA over the year earlier period.
It would be easy to forecast that 2022 markets will continue along this track, especially given the length of time it will take for any new housing supply to meet demand. An increase in interest rates may very well affect demand for cash-strapped would-be buyers. But there is one powerful variable that has little to do with market fundamentals and everything to do with politics that threatens to distort the resolution of an important issue at a crucial time.
In 2022, Ontario will have both provincial and municipal elections. Both will have a bearing on the long-term future of housing markets. Precampaign positioning suggests that the already testy relationship between provincial and municipal levels of government could become even more so.
During the September federal election, voter concerns about affordable housing made it a hot-button issue. While many promises were made in the heat of campaigning, one level of government could not unilaterally address such a complex and multi-jurisdictional issue. The failure to achieve meaningful collaboration between all three levels of government does not bode well for a timely resolution of such a pressing challenge.
Ontario's Ford government has flagged a heightened focus on housing in the months leading up to a June election. The Conservatives are already polling voters on the matter while openly criticizing municipalities for stalling new building permits and impeding timely access to infrastructure for new developments. In addition to proposing a "scoring" system for the pace of permitting by cities and towns, Premier Doug Ford also plans to convene a mayoral summit to demonstrate to municipal leaders and provincial voters that this is a top priority.
The premier's concern is backed by the latest data from Statistics Canada. It shows the value of housing permits decreased 2.1 per cent in August to $9.7 billion, with Ontario and British Columbia declining the most.
Nevertheless, for Ontario mayors and councillors facing re-election just a few months later, this deliberately public pressure will complicate and potentially sour the relationships even further. By tagging municipal governments as the root of the housing crisis, Ford may spur some action. But, at the same time, he will likely incite a defensiveness that could make collaboration more difficult at such a critical time.
Further complicating matters is that federal, provincial and municipal governments are direct financial stakeholders in the very markets they are grappling to address. Property tax represents about 32 per cent of Toronto's operating budget, while about six per cent comes from the municipal land transfer tax. Another 30 per cent of the city's budget comes from such housing-related user fees as water and garbage collection. About 15 per cent of Ontario's education budget, also a voter hot button, comes from provincial property taxes.
Finally, there is the reality that affordable housing has an exceptionally high emotional quotient while cutting across issues ranging from social policy and human rights to business, economic development, urban planning, immigration strategy and, yes, politics.
As forecasts go, it is safe to predict that uncertainty about so many things we once took for granted will remain through 2022. But one thing is certain: The housing supply crisis is escalating. The sooner private and public sector forces work together on solutions, avoiding the temptation to point fingers and apportion blame, the sooner supply and demand will be rebalanced and healthy, sustainable real estate markets will be restored.
